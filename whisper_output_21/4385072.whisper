asr:0: OUTPUT 169.45-171.99: Even with a challenging macro backdrop. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.05-181.16: CyTime continued to execute, demonstrated by a record quarterly revenue of $32.7 million for third quarter 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 181.18-186.09: Which was above our updated guidance range of 31 to 32 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 187.77-199.20: Our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments, our customer base, and the exceptional dedication of the CITAN team, all of which have benefited CITAN during the current environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 200.32-207.71: During this third quarter, revenue grew 52% sequentially compared to our second quarter 2020 revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 208.47-215.56: We anticipate that continued strength in the fourth quarter will allow for CyTime to set another quarterly revenue record. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 215.70-221.66: And Art's going to discuss our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook later in the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 222.88-229.67: Now, SciTime's fabulous model and multi-source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 229.69-234.25: While at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 235.28-241.10: In contrast, we believe that the quartz industry infrastructure has several points of failure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 241.12-247.43: Which can cause supply disruptions, some of which we have heard about through recent industry commentary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 248.41-252.69: Additionally, within the timing market, responsiveness is becoming a key theme. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 253.01-260.18: And we believe that many competitors and courts may not be set up to support industry needs and requirements for the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 260.98-270.01: In infrastructure applications, our speed of response to environmental disruptors, such as temperature change, minimizes the system level impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 271.13-280.10: In mobile IoT, our kilohertz products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely, something that's unique to CyTime. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 281.18-288.79: On the supply side, our programmability continues to enable the flexibility, speed, and delivery required by our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 289.75-293.87: With the recent introduction of our Apex MIMS family of resonator products,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 293.89-301.62: CyTime now offers all three categories of timing products, which are the oscillators, the clocks, and the resonators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 303.28-310.77: As of the third quarter, we have cumulatively shipped almost 2 billion oscillators, all of them with an embedded MEMS resonator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 311.27-314.03: Our combined knowledge of the MEMS, the analog chips. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 314.05-322.60: The package and the materials is unique to the industry and offers a system level understanding for our resonator customers as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 323.90-328.13: Now we know that the manufacturing MEMS products in high volume is not easy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 329.27-333.09: Men's product leaders in other markets, non-timing markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 333.11-339.86: Maintain their leadership position because they invested early, focused on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 340.64-347.87: And we believe today that SITEM is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 349.11-356.04: Our Apex MENS resonators are ideally suited for high-volume, space-constrained mobile and IoT applications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 356.06-363.02: Such as Bluetooth, wearables, high-speed connectivity interfaces, asset tracking, and microcontrollers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 363.66-372.33: In addition to these applications, other system on a chip vendors can use our Apex MEMS resonators that would be co-packaged with the chip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 372.39-374.41: Just like we do in our oscillators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 376.20-386.25: Given our broad knowledge of timing market solutions across all three categories, we believe our system-level timing solutions save customer design time,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 386.27-389.29: Increase their end products performance and reliability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 389.31-394.63: While also reducing their overall board footprint, creating value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 397.08-404.95: Moving to 5G, in 5G the opportunities available to CyTime continue to drive the company's expansion into the communications market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 405.59-413.79: Our products continue to see solid design traction in 5G applications at tier one manufacturers of telecommunication equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 414.77-421.00: In addition, we had previously mentioned ORAN, which is Open Radio Access Networks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 421.12-430.87: And we continue to see significant interest in O-RAN hardware solutions that are being developed for greenfield operators as well as the traditional carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.87-441.36: O-RAN is getting traction because it gives operators best-in-class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 442.06-449.39: And the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for SITEM success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 450.35-456.44: We're getting significant traction with O-RAN customers worldwide across the entire radio networks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 456.46-460.42: Including RRUs, small cells, and distributed units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 462.10-471.09: In the area of 5G optical transport, where we are engaged with 100 to 800G optical and SOC suppliers,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 471.11-476.52: With our FIT 9501 products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 477.18-483.52: We find that we are able to offer unique value with high performance in the smallest form factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 485.07-493.23: In conclusion, CyTime is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the first company that continues to provide system-level timing solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 494.05-501.20: That said, this is only the first step of a multi-year strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 501.82-510.07: We remain a results-driven company with a culture that encourages creativity, leadership, and a strong commitment to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 510.09-513.23: Which continues to be reflected in our recent quarterly trends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 514.31-523.26: I'd now like to turn the call over to Art as he will discuss in more detail our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Art? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 524.97-527.69: Thanks Rajesh and good afternoon everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 528.93-533.77: We are very pleased to be holding our fourth financial results conference call as a public company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 534.39-541.00: And during my review today, I'll discuss third quarter 2020 financial results and will provide guidance for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 542.40-549.39: I'll focus my discussion on non-GAAP financial results and refer you to today's press release for a detailed description of our GAAP results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 549.41-557.42: As well as reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 558.94-563.20: So first of all, Q3 was really an excellent quarter for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 563.74-571.33: We had strong revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion, and very positive non-GAAP net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.83-577.34: As you know, at the end of August, we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter by more than 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 577.98-583.64: And I'm happy to report that actual results exceeded the high end of that revised guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.49-594.31: Revenue for the quarter was $32.7 million, up 52% sequentially, and up 29% over the same quarter a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 595.68-600.36: To provide some color on end markets, I'll report sales by market group as I have in the past. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 602.22-610.31: The first is mobile, IoT, and consumer, which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones, wearable devices, and consumer products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 611.07-617.42: This was the segment most impacted by the global slowdown in Q2, but it came back strong in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.68-624.64: Sales were $20.9 million or 64% of total sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 624.88-630.99: Up 105% sequentially and up 19% over the same quarter a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 633.17-636.36: The second is industrial, automotive, and aerospace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.38-643.40: Which goes into industrial, automotive, aerospace, military applications, and includes broad-based sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 644.32-653.13: Sales were $6.4 million or 20% of sales, up 5% sequentially and up 23% over the same quarter a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 655.78-663.28: The third is communications and enterprise, which consists of wireless infrastructure, including 5G, data center, and networking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 664.14-668.13: This was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 669.11-678.80: Sales were $5.4 million for 16% of sales, up 3% sequentially, and up 103% year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 681.50-689.17: We had just one end customer where sales exceeded 10% and sales to that customer were 45% of total sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 692.69-698.38: We've had a number of initiatives within the company to expand gross margins, and those initiatives are paying off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 699.36-707.39: Non-GAAP gross margins during the quarter were 52.1% of 530 basis points over Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 709.47-717.86: Non-GAAP operating expenses were $12.5 million, up 5% sequentially, comprised of $7.0 million in R&D. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 717.88-720.78: And 5.5 million in SG&A expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 722.96-725.75: That interest expense was $0.1 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 727.23-734.35: And this generated non-GAAP net income of $4.4 million or 23 cents per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.20-741.40: And that's compared to a loss in the prior quarter of 2.2 million, or 14 cents a share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 743.14-747.49: Stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax is $5.1 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 748.21-752.35: This is higher than the 3.4 million in Q2 due to the higher stock price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 753.09-758.88: Some new higher stock grants, and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 761.18-767.95: Trade receivables were $17.2 million. That was up from $13.0 million in Q2 due to the higher revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 768.93-776.48: But DSOs decreased from 58 days in Q2 to just 49 days in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.54-783.84: Inventory was $15.2 million, up slightly from $14.8 million in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 785.91-793.81: We generated $4.2 million in cash from operations and used $2.5 million for the purchase of assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.96-804.62: We had $35 million in bank debt going into the quarter, but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 806.33-810.59: We then ended the quarter with $69.2 million in cash and equivalents. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 814.27-817.30: I'd now like to provide some guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.54-822.02: We expect Q4 to be another great quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 822.82-829.59: With continued sequential revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and increasing net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 831.27-836.22: We expect fourth quarter revenue will be up 10 to 15% sequentially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 837.36-844.68: At the midpoint, this would put revenue at about $36.8 million or 30% higher than the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 847.03-855.34: We expect continued gross margin expansion with non-GAP gross margins increasing to approximately 53 percent, plus or minus a point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 856.92-865.97: Operating expenses are expected to increase between 8 and 10 percent sequentially, which at the midpoint would be approximately $13.7 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 867.77-871.85: We will not incur any interest expense since we no longer have any bank debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 873.55-882.66: Income taxes will be nominal and less than 50K for the quarter. The basic share count in Q4 will be approximately 17.0 million shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 883.58-890.09: In addition, the diluted impact of employee RSUs will add approximately 2.2 million shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 890.33-897.94: Taking the total diluted share count used for our EPS calculation to approximately 19.2 million shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 900.60-910.07: Stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $5.5 million up from Q3 due to the higher stock price and a few new higher grants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 912.37-920.84: So based on the guidance just given, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS will be between. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 920.86-924.26: $0.28 and $0.32 per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 927.03-932.61: So, in summary, we have an exceptional workforce that is performing extremely well working from home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 933.53-937.96: We have truly differentiated products that address large and growing markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 939.18-944.84: We have a number of new products in the pipeline, an enviable list of tier one customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.86-949.99: A strong balance sheet and we're looking forward to a very strong Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 950.91-954.47: So with that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 960.64-969.01: Operator? At this time, I would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 969.45-971.63: Again, that is as far as I want to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 974.61-984.10: We have your first question from Blaine Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blaine Curtis. Congrats on the really nice results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 984.72-992.63: My first question was around the improvement throughout the quarter. Obviously, you updated guidance in late August, positively, and then you're now coming ahead of that range now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.39-996.06: What most materially improved between now and then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 996.66-1005.47: And then if you could look out into December, you're obviously guiding for some more expansion there. Could you give us a little color on segments between the three where you're seeing that grow sequentially? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1007.27-1015.48: So from Q2 to Q3, as I mentioned, the most significant growth was in our mobile IoT group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1016.06-1024.52: Part of that is seasonality, but we just had real strengths kind of across the board with our customers in that segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1025.31-1033.91: We also mentioned in our revised – in our press release with our revised guidance in August that we had won a design win, a phone design win. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1034.47-1035.94: That also contributed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.40-1044.82: We're not going to report the phone revenue specifically, one, because we're not allowed to, but I will provide some color to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1045.41-1047.75: When we increased our guidance in August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1048.45-1052.85: About half of that increase was related to that new phone design win. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.45-1059.82: And the balance was obviously then strength in non-foam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1060.66-1063.72: So that was kind of what happened in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1064.04-1071.93: In the fourth quarter, we're seeing very strong revenue growth. As I mentioned, our guidance is that revenue will be up 10 to 15%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.05-1081.40: I'll mention the phone again, not specifically, but phone revenue will probably account for about a third of that sequential improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.44-1086.49: And therefore, non-phone basically accounts for the balance of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1086.79-1092.29: So we're expecting growth in all of our market segments going from Q3 to Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1094.07-1096.94: That's super helpful. And then my follow-up is just really around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.02-1104.94: The largest customer for you guys. That obviously stepped up materially into September. Along with that, margins clearly stepped up as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.15-1107.81: Can you talk about what's driving that better margin performance? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1108.01-1112.79: Clearly, you're seeing some accretive gross margin dollars as that customer steps up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1112.97-1118.58: Can you talk to your other segments as well? Is there a material part of that uptick that's also coming from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1118.60-1123.40: The comms enterprise and the auto industrial space as well as those products move along. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1123.84-1125.73: Absolutely, absolutely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.99-1131.99: We've talked for a long time about the gross margin drivers in our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1133.07-1142.04: Our newer products generally are higher ASP and higher performance. As those newer products become a larger percentage of our sales,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.08-1143.32: That drives higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1143.34-1145.75: Blended gross margins, that's one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1146.09-1150.21: We're taking more of our sales direct. That cuts out the distributor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1150.81-1158.06: That improves our gross margins. We've made a lot of progress in reducing our product material costs. That would be wafer costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.10-1167.55: That improves gross margins. Our ops group has done a great job at improving sort and test yields and package costs. That improves gross margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.27-1177.52: Volume helps us, our manufacturing overhead, even though we're fabless, we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that's relatively fixed. So as the volume goes up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.24-1183.34: That manufacturing overhead is percent of sales decreases. That helps gross margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.96-1187.41: And so, you know, we've been working on this now for a while. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.51-1194.37: And we saw very significant gross margin expansion from Q2 to Q3, as I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.55-1199.02: Gross margins increased 530 basis points from Q2 to Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1199.76-1205.31: And I've guided for at least another point of improvement, plus or minus, going from Q3 to Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1207.79-1210.29: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1214.23-1218.48: We have your next question from Thor Vanburg from Stifel. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.20-1223.44: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the record results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1224.22-1231.49: You called out some challenges in the courts industry, your competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.87-1234.43: Could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1235.80-1240.00: What does that really mean for new engagements and new design links for Citeboard? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1242.04-1244.62: Yeah, I think we talked a little bit about it last time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1245.57-1255.90: Basically, the quartz industry, as we know, has done a stellar job in the last 70 years of providing products to everybody in the electronics world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1256.26-1266.13: But I think that it is still a batch process. It is a fab process. It's a factory process. Everybody has to invest in factories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.59-1271.49: And these factories are purpose-made so they can't be used for anything else. They don't have the scale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1271.77-1279.18: And they don't have the flexibility that a fabulous company like CyTime, which uses semiconductors, can get. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1279.28-1284.62: I mean, as a reminder, when we build our MEMS resonators,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1284.68-1292.13: 10,000 wafers should give us about a billion units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1292.57-1298.14: And these are 180 nanometer technology wafers, so not really that difficult to get. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.54-1304.78: So, fundamentally, their supply chain is batch made, and I think it has these issues with it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.01-1311.75: There were some reports of some stumbles in FABs in the Asian markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1312.03-1315.26: And I think we saw a spike in demand coming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.38-1325.23: That didn't impact Q3, by the way. I'm just talking that we saw spikes in people because people get nervous when that happens, and this is not the first time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.25-1331.53: Ten years ago, there was a big problem with ceramic packaging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1331.81-1337.28: As you know, all quartz products, whether oscillators or resonators, are quartz packaged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1337.36-1342.30: Because they're fragile and they want to keep a very strong packaging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.66-1350.51: Those quartz ceramic packages come from only two people in the world and sometimes there's a shortage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1350.73-1355.70: I think they have these multiple points of failure potentially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1355.84-1358.14: And that's what I was pointing out to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1358.22-1367.71: And yeah, there have been some anecdotal events in the last few months, and in the continuing, we expect to see that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.35-1371.71: It's just a reminder to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1372.05-1377.88: It doesn't significantly change our revenue, but what it does is in the medium to longer term,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1378.72-1386.51: It gets our customers a reminder that they're probably better off in moving to more stable supply chains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.29-1390.59: That's great perspective. Thank you for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.07-1400.92: That's my follow-up. Congratulations on entering the resonator market. And now, obviously, you're covering the entire gamut of the timing market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1401.34-1407.51: I know in the past you've talked about targeting at about a $10 billion tab if you kind of combine all three subsegments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1408.47-1414.31: Could you update us where your SAN is now with your penetration with new products into the resume to market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1415.52-1420.30: Yeah, our SAM is still around a billion to a billion point two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1420.40-1426.53: It might be a little bit higher depending on when we introduce products and so on, but it's certainly less than $2 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1427.39-1432.63: It's also mostly concentrated right now in oscillators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.11-1442.30: So while we do have resonators that have been introduced, while we do have analog clocking solutions that have been introduced,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.68-1448.65: Our ramp into that from a revenue point of view, we have already said expectations will be relatively slow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1449.17-1460.22: I think our entry into these markets is significant for customers in the following way, in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.24-1461.82: On all of these products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.18-1465.41: And not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1465.73-1475.08: Sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or oscillators or clocking, and then that becomes an entry point to talking about other products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1475.52-1480.16: So it's from a TAM point of view, we're still pretty tiny. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.86-1489.35: You know, one and a half billion in TAM out of an $8 billion total market. SAM at one and a half billion TAM out of an $8 billion total TAM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1489.73-1497.22: And of course, CyTime's revenue is still pretty small in comparison at around $100 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.66-1506.93: So we still, even if we maintain and did not grow our SAM very much, we would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1508.63-1511.97: Thank you for that, Rajesh, and congratulations again. Great. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.39-1518.36: We have your next question from Quinn Bolton from MidHem. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1520.00-1525.99: Congratulations on the nice results. Wanted to start off with the supply chain issues. You talked about with quartz, I believe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.49-1532.93: That was one of the factors that led to the phone win that you announced last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.27-1540.70: You look forward to think that those court supply chain issues positioning potentially win additional skews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1541.08-1544.90: Either at that customer or other large smartphone vendors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.65-1552.21: I think that will have some impact, Quinn, but I don't think that it's forecastable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1553.15-1558.72: I think it's a general slow trend and I've talked about this several times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1558.78-1567.23: It's a general slow trend. It's not at the point where it's gotten that snowball has become very big, but it's a trend that we see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.25-1574.09: And we've always said that people design us in for performance reasons as well as for supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1574.19-1578.18: But overwhelmingly the designers for performance reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1578.48-1587.21: Just to pick up, I would say less than 15% of the time we get designed in for supply chain reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.59-1590.81: But those supply chain reasons are important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.85-1603.48: Because when people look at their supply chains and see these perturbations that happen from time to time, and by the way, these perturbations are not new, they've been going on for a long time,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1603.54-1606.29: But customers did not have an alternative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1606.67-1613.09: Now that they do have an alternative, it just becomes one more faster in their thinking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1613.13-1620.90: Particularly when they're looking further out in time, particularly, say, for example, in automotive or mill arrow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.92-1628.83: Or longer-term industrial products that have a slow ramp in multiple years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.45-1632.15: Many of them start to think it might be prudent to do that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.93-1641.48: But I would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1642.90-1650.33: Great. The second question, I know with the recent introduction of the Apex MEMS family, you're moving into the resonator market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1650.81-1658.02: Are you targeting select frequencies, high volume frequencies with the initial resonators? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1658.76-1667.83: I guess a related question, since you designed this in silicon, do you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1667.85-1670.33: Uh... In those resonator structures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1672.05-1675.46: Yeah, absolutely. To answer your second question first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1675.84-1685.39: We do need a new mask set, but sometimes those are very similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.65-1691.17: The design of the resonator is not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1691.19-1697.96: Very different. For example, between a 24 MHz and a 26 MHz, it's not going to be very different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1698.38-1704.70: However, between a 24 megahertz and 76.8 megahertz, I think it could be different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.65-1715.40: But generally, the good news is that the resonator industry has worked around the quartz limitations in the past. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1715.80-1724.72: And there are basically a handful, maybe two handfuls, so call it a dozen, quote unquote, popular frequencies that exist. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1724.98-1734.19: And so I think that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1734.59-1740.50: And you're absolutely right, we will not only target the most popular ones, but we'll target the ones where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.54-1752.63: The frequency is one thing, but where we bring the combination of size, of resilience, of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1752.65-1759.26: And clearly of high volume because these are low-priced products. They are sub-20-cent products in price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1759.60-1766.87: And so obviously the volume has to be, opportunity has to be in the tens of millions for it to be interesting for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1768.29-1771.27: Those are some of the key reasons to do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.79-1777.56: Now, there's another thing that's going to happen over time as frequencies of SOCs increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.64-1786.21: The requirement for frequencies beyond, say, 75 megahertz increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.25-1799.20: And that's an area where we think that quartz technology has difficulty getting to a high volume, high frequency, high reliability, small size product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1799.76-1808.61: And that's where also we would shine. And I'm thinking two, three, four years out, particularly in consumer products, perhaps in phone applications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.29-1820.40: Thank you for that additional detail. And then just quickly for Art, you mentioned each of the segments would grow in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you might be able to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.42-1827.19: Rank order if one's growing much much faster than the others you expect all of them to grow about the same rate Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1828.39-1833.47: Sure. Fair question. I don't think we wanted to get that detailed in our guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1833.57-1836.54: We do expect growth in each one of those segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1837.76-1843.94: And I'll leave it at that and we'll announce that segment growth in more detail when we actually announce fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.47-1848.23: Thanks, Quinn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1851.13-1858.94: We have your next question from Suji De Silva from Ross Capital. Your line is open. Hi, Rajesh. Hi. Congratulations on the strong results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.02-1865.49: So perhaps for Art, with the increasing mobile content you have now,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.83-1870.73: This a framework for thinking about seasonality going forward, first half, first second half, first Q. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.19-1875.66: Versus maybe before coming into this year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.10-1882.60: Well, if you look at the seasonality in our business, and we do have seasonality, go back to last year, 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.20-1887.85: Second half of the year, much stronger than the first half. People can go back and quantify that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1888.33-1895.72: We saw pretty much the same thing this year. You know, the back half of this year, much stronger than the first half of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.98-1905.33: Q2, of course, was somewhat depressed in our mobile and IoT segment because of the global slowdown and the fact that so many retail stores were closed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1906.03-1912.71: And I think next year it's going to be somewhat similar in terms of first half versus second half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1913.25-1916.56: Obviously, we expect year-over-year growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1916.64-1923.28: Q1 next year should be nicely higher than Q1 of this year and Q2 over Q2 and 3 and 3 and 4 and 4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1923.96-1929.01: So we expect next year we'll have good growth. We're not quantifying that at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.83-1936.90: But in terms of the seasonality, it's going to look, I think, similar to how it looked last year and this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.12-1943.60: That's very helpful. And then perhaps on the infrastructure side, 5G wireless infrastructure in particular,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.22-1953.55: Are you having design wins kind of showing up every quarter that help that be a steady growth driver, or might you ebb and flow with the 5G build out puts and takes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1955.44-1959.58: Yeah, I think it's a slow, steady drumbeat of products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.60-1968.95: Our products are also showing up. We talked about the 9501 in the optical module business that's clearly showing up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.29-1972.81: The ORAN that I referred to earlier, I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.23-1979.06: We had tens of design wins that showed up in the last few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1980.32-1983.24: Yeah, so it's just a steady growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1983.40-1992.41: And what I'm excited about is the breadth of where 5G touches. So, again, as I've said, it's not just the digital unit or the RRU. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.49-1996.34: It's the mid-haul, the back-haul, the microwave, the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1996.36-2003.14: It's in the servers, it's in so much of the infrastructure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2003.66-2009.37: And as I've mentioned before, this is probably a five, seven year rollout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.75-2015.36: And should be a very, very solid place for CyTime. Okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.06-2025.93: We have your next question from Alessandra Vecchi from William Blair. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2027.47-2036.98: Sure. Maybe a quick question for Art just on operating expenses. Can you update us on the long-term operating model and how we should be thinking about it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2037.54-2045.79: You guys have really had or done a tremendous job growing revenue the last couple quarters with very little OPEX flow through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2046.81-2054.65: So wondering how to think about it. Yeah, great question. Well, revenue kind of got ahead of our expenses. So that's a good thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2055.32-2061.96: You know, our kind of stated long-term goal is that we would grow OPEX at about half the rate of top-line growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2062.32-2071.67: So, just for sake of mathematical example, if we were to grow revenue year over year by 20%, then I would expect OpEx to grow by about 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2072.07-2075.20: So that's kind of a generalized long-term goal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2075.76-2085.35: If you look at the last couple of quarters, Q2, our revenue went up 52% sequentially, but OPEX only went up 5% sequentially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.37-2087.93: We couldn't ramp expenses quite fast enough. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.51-2096.64: My guide for Q4, we're guiding revenue up 10 to 15% and I'm guiding OPEX up 8 to 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.68-2104.12: That's a little more than half the top line rate, but that's because of a little bit of a catch-up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.14-2107.43: So low in terms of OPEX growth in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.49-2112.29: So does that kind of frame it for you? Yeah, that helps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2113.51-2122.76: I have a comment on that, and that comment is that a reminder that Cytem is an analog semiconductor company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2122.80-2126.53: Other semiconductor companies that are using 7-nanometer tape-outs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.23-2130.79: We're doing 180, 130, 65 nanometer tape outs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2131.67-2141.44: When you think of other companies doing a bunch of software in OpEx and scaling that, we're not in the software business or not meaningfully in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.90-2148.81: On the other hand, the number of opportunities that are coming at us are coming pretty thick and fast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2149.21-2158.04: So we always would like to retain the ability to invest at a greater rate within reason. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2158.06-2161.70: To the model that was put out by art. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.54-2168.45: Understood. That's helpful and a helpful reminder on the geometries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.67-2175.96: And then just one more question. I believe last quarter when you announced the Cascade product, the Clock IC product,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2176.94-2184.72: That you expected revenue to really be a 2021 event beginning and then probably ramping beyond that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.13-2192.15: As we look at the standalone resonator product, should we be thinking about the timeframe to revenue in a similar fashion? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.17-2195.28: What are the puts and takes to their customer standpoint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2196.28-2198.42: Yeah, I would say that's even slower, Alex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2198.88-2200.28: I would say that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2201.02-2202.40: You know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2202.48-2213.41: Because there are two kinds of design wins we would have. We would have standalone design wins. We would go to OEMs and sell them resonators. That is one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.09-2220.00: And then the other one would be to go to SOC vendors, the ones we sort of, for example, gave. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2220.30-2222.38: And they would design it into their products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2222.74-2226.21: Both of them, particularly the second one, take a long time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2226.65-2234.43: So the gestation period for that, for meaningful revenue, is easily twice as long as the clocking business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2235.58-2244.54: So yeah, so of course there can be other times when it can happen very fast, but generally that's a good rule of thumb. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.67-2250.07: That's helpful. That's it for me. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.15-2257.56: We have your next question from Chris Castle from Raymond James. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2258.70-2262.48: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess a question on margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2262.88-2264.26: And up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2264.42-2270.49: I guess as we go forward into next year, there's a lot of different factors with seasonality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2270.51-2277.52: Some of the different margin profiles of the different segments that are going to move in seasonality. Could you give us a sense of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.54-2288.15: You know, what should we expect as we go through the year, particularly in the first half of next year as some of the consumer-related products, you know, typically would be seasonally weaker. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2289.09-2292.15: Yeah, great question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2292.51-2301.34: You know, our long-term goal for gross margins that we've talked about is getting gross margins somewhere closer to 60%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.28-2306.19: And that's going to take us two to three years, give or take. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2307.09-2313.91: So, you know, if you just kind of do that math, you know, we're targeting gross margin expansion of maybe 3 points a year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2314.43-2317.12: We obviously did much better than that going from Q2 to Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2317.52-2325.55: But, you know, just for the next couple of years, if we can add three points, we get to 60% margin, you know, in two to three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2326.51-2331.59: Within a year, there are some dynamics that affect gross margins by quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.73-2341.62: And you're right, in the first half of the year, generally our mobile IoT and consumer business, which is somewhat lower gross margins, not that much lower, but a little bit lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2342.26-2346.97: Would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the first half of the year just because of mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.05-2356.28: But the counter to that is we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead, so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2356.88-2365.49: So taking all of that into account, just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2366.19-2368.47: I would expect the same thing next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2369.29-2378.80: So if you're modeling this, I would model gross margins for what you think it would be for the year in total. Margins will be higher in the back half than they will be in the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2381.12-2386.75: And that's as the poor mix is offset by the higher ed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2386.79-2393.93: Manufacturing efficiencies in the second half of the year. Right, and the volume is a little heavier weighting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2393.95-2399.04: I would actually expect gross margins to pull back just a little bit in the first half of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.40-2406.23: But I expect them to be much stronger in the back half of next year, even stronger, of course, than they are in the back half of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2407.33-2408.75: All right, that's very helpful. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2409.63-2416.90: As a follow-up, perhaps you could talk to us about what you're targeting for next year. There's a lot of opportunities in front of you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2418.14-2423.18: You know what in terms of what do you expect what what do you expect to drive the growth next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2423.36-2432.35: And there's a lot on your plate, there's a lot of opportunity there. What are the things we should be paying attention to most closely as we go into next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2437.12-2443.48: I think the market trends that we have outlined continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.96-2448.01: So clearly, comms enterprise data centers are a big play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.17-2459.88: We are continuing to find more traction in automotive as more and more electric vehicles show up because a lot of automated driving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2460.00-2461.72: Is happening in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2462.84-2469.75: We have a nice little story and connection growing in the middle aerospace market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.73-2480.64: And then finally, the mobile IoT piece of it, less the consumer, the mobile IoT piece of it, is always a natural place for CyTime's growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2481.60-2484.96: Because of the size, the resiliency, and the performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2485.53-2493.29: So I think we're also continuing to expand our customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2493.71-2500.86: Five years ago, we were addressing about 2,000 customers. Today, we're about 5X that, maybe a little bit more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2501.66-2506.75: I think the expansion of customer base, this is not the big customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2507.07-2514.09: This is customers that are of a much, much smaller size where we are working in the channel to connect with them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2514.45-2517.58: I think that's a good initiative for CyTime as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.14-2525.05: So I think those are some ways that we think about it. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Chris. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2528.83-2535.46: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Arthur Chadwick. Sir, please continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2536.50-2539.84: Well, we want to thank everybody for joining us today on the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2540.46-2546.65: And we hope that you have a great day. And thanks again for all your support. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2549.35-2559.06: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.
