asr:0: OUTPUT 75.42-84.66: These risks include, among others, matters that we have described in our Form 8K filed with the SEC this morning and other filings that we make with the SEC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 85.31-92.81: We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which may not be updated until our next quarterly earnings call, if at all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 93.51-100.64: All references on this call to the quarter or a year or to our fiscal quarter or fiscal year, unless otherwise stated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 102.02-111.25: Joining me on the call today are our President and CEO, Rod Rushing, as well as our CFO, Mark Skanechny. Please turn now to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Rod. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 112.49-115.68: Thank you, Drew, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 116.30-120.38: I'd like to start by welcoming everyone back from what I hope was a healthy and happy holiday season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 120.90-126.93: We are pleased to report improved earnings for the fourth quarter, where we achieved the high end of our guidance that we provided in our last quarterly call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 127.61-135.94: Sales of $616 million were up 6% sequentially despite some lingering in-market challenges related to COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.28-142.06: Illustrating the benefit of a diverse portfolio of businesses as well as momentum that we're building operationally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 142.64-147.17: Our fiscal fourth quarter EBITDA of $28 million grew 45%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 147.71-155.72: Our EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis, despite a 6% decline in our revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 156.70-161.26: Our business generated 31% more EWDA this quarter than we did in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 161.50-168.59: And we were able to convert those earnings into cash allowing us to reduce our net debt by over $40 million within the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 169.39-172.79: We fully participated in the increased demand for recreational vehicles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.81-175.92: And showed market share gain in three out of five product categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 175.94-186.73: While our fire and emergency margins approved throughout the year, the commercial segment was able to address an organic drop in sales of $120 million and limit our full year decremental EBITDA margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 188.09-196.72: During the last nine months, we faced difficulties and perhaps some unprecedented external challenges while delivering three quarters of sequential margin improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 197.48-203.86: We still have much work remaining and we continue to operate through the challenges with parts supply and absenteeism. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 204.90-214.31: Tied to the COVID matter. However, we believe we're in a position to continue to deliver year-over-year improvements throughout the upcoming fiscal year through our operational disciplines and capabilities that we are building. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 215.44-225.37: One important cornerstone that we are committed to establish at REV is to have aligned and unified leadership team that operates under the principles of timely, data-driven, fact-based decision making. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 225.39-227.51: With a high sense of ownership and accountability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 228.69-235.54: We have spent quite a bit of time the last few months focused on leadership alignment and organizational structure. We have completed our review of the businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 236.44-238.70: And we have implemented a redesign of our operating model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 239.64-248.71: This was a thoughtful examination of how the business operates, where decisions are made, and how we are structured to predictably deliver results, creating value for our customers and shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 249.99-258.56: The result aligns leadership and management on how we're going to run this business and where accountability sits within the organization while simplifying our business and optimizing our cost structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 259.68-264.46: There are many changes that were made to this process, but I will provide a bit of insight on a few examples. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 265.49-269.21: We made a decision to move our center-led parts business back to the business units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 270.05-277.82: There was an initial hypothesis that growth would be achieved by implementing a consolidated centralized parts business stemming from some in-market synergies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 278.24-288.19: That growth did not materialize. Our businesses inherently know our customers and products and have the institutional knowledge to answer questions and deliver results to our customers more efficiently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 289.39-293.51: Further, the realignment will create a $5 million annual structural cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 294.63-302.92: Combined outcome of reducing complexity for our customers, the unrealized growth, and what ended up being creating a duplicate cost structure drove the decision to make this change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 304.48-310.55: This decision was the result of a careful examination of how to efficiently serve our customers and simplify our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 311.37-318.08: Conversely, there are a few aspects of our operating model where we move more firmly to a center-led operation and becoming an operating company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 318.80-327.79: These include development of a center-led activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence, where scaling of capabilities and processes will yield value creation for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 329.01-335.48: Many of these capabilities have been discussed by management previously, but have lacked the commitment and rigor to yield sustainable improvements that create value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 336.10-341.76: We are focused on changing that and made investments in new personnel and technologies to our operating model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 341.78-346.79: To build the disciplines necessary to drive sustainable improvement of performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.79-356.04: As part of our operational excellence, we are building capabilities to improve database decision making, simplify operations, and improve efficiencies on our balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 356.72-362.30: This includes discipline review and controls of corporate costs, manufacturing overhead, labor, and direct materials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 362.38-367.67: It requires increased capabilities focused on engineering, manufacturing, and operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 367.73-376.02: Supply chain and purchasing. To accelerate the change process and create a best-in-class operations, we have made several management changes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 376.56-378.32: There are a couple that I'd like to highlight today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 379.52-386.01: First, we've expanded the role of our commercial president, Brian Prairie, to include the role of senior vice president of operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 386.63-391.95: In this role, Brian leads our manufacturing execution, operational excellence, and supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 392.69-399.60: Brian is a master black belt in Six Sigma, a lean sensei, and has extensive background in manufacturing operations and purchasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.00-403.60: Making him the ideal person to build out our center-led operational efforts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 404.50-409.31: He is well positioned to take on this dual role while continuing to lead our commercial segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 410.19-415.82: In addition, we have hired Rob Dyslowski as Vice President and Chief Supply Officer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 416.40-423.82: Rob joins RevGroup having recently led Honeywell's Intelligrated Global Supply Chain and was Honeywell's Corporate Chief Procurement Officer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 425.15-433.05: At CPO at Honeywell, he managed an $18 billion annual spend portfolio, as well as leading 3,000 global procurement specialists. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 434.17-440.30: Rob has a very broad industrial background from aerospace, automotive, paint and coatings, and includes logistics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 441.00-445.85: He has had executive leadership roles with XPO Logistics, Dallas Bar, Reynolds Group, and Alcoa. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 446.83-454.87: He brings the Rev Group both the vision and the execution capabilities to build the best class global sourcing organization we're looking for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 454.89-457.00: And purchasing supply chain organizations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 457.48-459.88: Combined with a sense of urgency to do this at a pace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 460.64-467.53: Rob has only been in the position at REV for a few weeks, but he's taken an exhausted look at our infrastructure and has quickly identified a list of opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.03-473.23: I'm very pleased to have Rob join our team and I look forward to the impact that he will have on our business performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 474.95-484.52: In my nine months since joining REV, there have been challenges, some that were expected and some that were unexpected. We've implemented much change during that time. We began to see sequential improvements in our results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 484.94-494.87: We have much work remaining in the months ahead, but I'm encouraged by the progress to date. I look forward to sharing more about the plans and the path forward with you during our analyst investor day that we're planning for April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 495.52-502.48: With that, I'm now going to turn it over to Mark for details on our fourth quarter segment performance. Mark? Thanks for having me, and good morning, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 503.18-508.17: Please turn to page four of the slide deck as I review our segment level performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 508.89-515.70: Prior to emergency, segment fourth quarter sales were $330 million, a 23% increase compared to prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.24-523.22: This includes approximately 75 million of sales attributable to our acquisition of Spartan ER that occurred earlier in the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 523.96-529.85: Excluding Spartan, organic segment sales decreased 6% from the fourth quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 530.35-537.04: While organic fire sales are relatively flat, we ship fewer ambulance units due to lingering impacts of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 537.78-547.55: Although down from prior year, North American ambulance deliveries increased 21% sequentially and order trends continue to remain strong as municipalities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 547.57-551.57: And federal stimulus dollars prioritize health and safety needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 552.15-562.10: CARES Act stimulus dollars remain available for ambulance units delivered through the 2021 calendar year end, continuing an important driver demand for our F&E segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 563.40-569.95: Within the fire division, throughput increased sequentially once again at our E1 plant in Ocala, Florida. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 570.35-580.06: Unit production was up 44% year over year, demonstrating the benefits of lean programs and operating disciplines that were deployed over the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 580.66-590.01: Bring in lean expertise to allow a dual track of effecting immediate change while allowing time to develop leadership, train internal resources,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 590.03-594.71: And build a pipeline of OPEX projects that will sustain continuous improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 595.48-604.44: We plan to follow this model of deploying Lean Assistants where we feel there will be an immediate impact while training our internal teams at all businesses through a Lean Academy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 604.46-608.65: That is designed to deliver annual throughput and cost out target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 610.03-619.48: F&E's segment adjusted EBITDA was $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 620.16-626.33: The increase was primarily due to the improvements in E1 just mentioned and the acquisition of Spartan ER. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 626.85-635.90: Amelin's EBITDA was relatively flat with the prior year despite the decrease in sales due to productivity improvements that increased margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 635.92-640.14: Most notably at our largest manufacturing location in Orlando. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 641.32-646.79: Spartan contributed four million just the dvd da to the after the segment within the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.81-651.99: Which completes three quarters of integration that exceeded expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 652.71-660.82: The addition of this world-class chassis manufacturing business provides a center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses and brands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 660.86-664.62: Creating further opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies within the segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 665.29-673.11: Spartan is now integrated into the F&E segment operationally, and we do not plan to call out its individual contribution in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 674.27-679.74: Total F&E backlog was $966 million, up 16% year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.12-687.29: This includes backlog acquired from Spartan and strong ambulance order intake throughout the fiscal year, including the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 688.03-693.95: A decline in legacy fire backlog is largely the result of increased throughput at the Alcala plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 693.97-701.20: And a decrease in fire industry unit orders that occurred from the onset of COVID through approximately September of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 701.84-705.69: Industry orders during that period declined over 25%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 706.23-714.51: Since that time and during the final two months of our fiscal 2020, our order rates improved to levels on par with fiscal year 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 716.04-722.84: Fire backlog remains strong and now reflects competitive industry lead times and ambulance backlog is at a record high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 722.86-727.69: Which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion to earnings within the F&E segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 728.17-739.68: We currently expect year over year F&E revenue improvement versus this year's softness related to COVID absenteeism and inspection delays, which occurred primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 740.20-744.86: At this time, absent another recurrence of the virus or additional government restrictions,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 744.90-750.57: We feel confident that we will convert to earnings more efficiently and with improved incremental margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 752.15-753.53: Turning to slide five. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.65-758.14: Commercial segment fourth quarter sales were 91 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 758.26-767.71: A decrease of 56 million compared to the prior period, which included approximately 57 million from the shuttle businesses divested in early 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 768.45-773.31: The organic decline of sales was related to lower sales at all businesses within the segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 773.95-782.16: Year-over-year school bus sales declined 14 percent in the fourth quarter which is a significant improvement to the third quarter decline of 31 percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 782.18-789.13: And puts our fiscal second half 2020 sales ahead of reported declines in industry registrations for the same period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 789.95-794.03: Municipal transit sales decreased 40% versus the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 794.05-802.26: Primarily due to delivery schedule adjustment to a large order to accommodate the needs of our customer that we disclosed in our fiscal third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 802.80-810.19: The change extended the delivery timeline through fiscal 2021 and there have been no further changes to that contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 810.99-815.60: Specialty markets remain depressed with sales down 40% versus last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 816.02-819.56: While this is an improvement from third quarter decline of 50%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 819.58-830.63: The sales were primarily existing stock units built to order cancellations or delays that needed significant rework to meet customer specifications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.29-836.62: Turning to segment adjusted EBITDA for the commercial segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 836.78-845.99: Commercial segment adjusted EBITDA of 6.4 million was down 61% versus the prior year period which included 1 million EBITDA related to divested. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 846.01-847.43: Shuttle bus businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 848.23-857.94: The decline in EBITDA was primarily a result of the sales decline in all businesses as well as the inefficiencies related to the rework of stock units within the specialty division. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.68-865.75: Although the stock unit rework had a negative contribution to performance in the quarter, given the severe end market declines in this business,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.79-870.51: We took the opportunity to right size what had become an inflated stock unit inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.09-876.68: Within the bus division despite revenue declines in both school and municipal markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 876.98-884.70: These businesses were able to continue to flex production with demand and contributed high single-digit EBITDA margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.97-890.49: Commercial segment backlog at the end of the fourth quarter with two hundred seventy four million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 890.51-896.46: Down 14% versus the prior year quarter which contained 86 million in the shuttle bus backlog. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 897.06-915.62: Excluding shuttle bus and 18% organic backlog increase is the result of an increase in specially division orders within the fourth quarter in timing of a large municipal transit order that entered backlog in the first quarter this year, partially offset by decreased school bus orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.42-923.58: The increased specialty orders were for both terminal trucks and street sweepers, and this quarter marks the best order intake since. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.60-926.61: Fiscal first quarter 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 927.43-931.51: We have been aggressively pursuing new contracts and renewals in these markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 931.57-939.52: Winning a large rental company contract for street sweepers, and advancing in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.34-944.26: Last month, we are excited to announce a partnership with Heister Yale Group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.28-951.17: To develop electric and hydrogen-powered terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase efficiency and productivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.57-957.44: We are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 958.82-964.28: With momentum in our specialty markets, a longer cycle municipal transit backlog. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 964.40-973.03: We feel the commercial segment is in a position to grow revenue despite uncertainty surrounding the timing of a full-time return to the classroom. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.05-975.12: And impact on school bus demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 975.76-985.61: As COVID-19 vaccines become more widespread, there is reason to be optimistic that decisions to reopen schools and districts will benefit our peak spring selling season for school bus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 986.23-990.79: Given the cost out activities that we took this year across all of our commercial segment businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.15-997.24: We expect increased volume and specialty and potentially school bus to convert at solid incremental margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.66-1005.29: We anticipate the overall variability of 2020's commercial segment bottom line margin performance will dissipate in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1005.71-1009.31: Absent any new government directives that may impact end markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1009.33-1018.92: Employer attendance or delivery acceptance, the near-term potential for this segment remains in the high single-digit EBITDA margin profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1020.18-1022.22: Turning the page to slide six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1023.30-1030.59: Recreation segment sales of $194 million were up 12% versus last year, reflecting strong wholesale shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1030.61-1034.55: And retail demand for Class B, Class C, and TOEBL units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1035.26-1044.14: Class A shipments were down mid-single digits versus last year as production was limited by supply chain constraints, primarily in gas units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1044.68-1052.29: We feel a backlog in production capacity are in place to support higher shipments once these bottlenecks clear. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.87-1059.32: Despite shipping fewer Class A units, our award-winning product introductions continue to take market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1059.34-1065.15: Resulting in higher retail demand, increased pricing, and lower discounting and allowances. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1066.57-1069.17: Recreation segment even immediate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1069.49-1076.72: Adjusted EBITDA was $20.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $12 million or 175% versus the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1077.26-1092.77: Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6% reflects the higher sales mix of non-Class A products within the quarter as well as the impact of operating leverage and productivity improvements achieved across all categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1092.79-1096.18: With sequential and year-over-year margin gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1096.90-1103.34: Despite its lower class A unit sales, profitability increased over 650 basis points versus fourth quarter 2000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1103.38-1107.51: And for a business that had recently struggled to break even. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1107.55-1112.01: It was encouraging to see profitability reach levels that had not attained over the past two years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1112.77-1117.38: We expect to continue this momentum by driving efficient manufacturing practices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1117.40-1123.90: And commercial activities focused on dealer wins and market share gains that would deliver sustainable performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1123.96-1129.09: Not only during this upturn in demand, but across all parts of demand and stocking cycles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.49-1140.60: Segment backlog increased 220% year-over-year to 540 million, which reflects strong order intake across all RV categories over the past six months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.02-1149.79: The past two quarters were historic highs for orders by a substantial margin and our current backlog is nearly double that of any point in REV's recreation segment history. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1150.25-1159.72: We feel this supports the current industry thinking that wholesale shipments will be up 20% or more in calendar 2021 and that our product portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.80-1166.35: Niche market placements and iconic brands lands us in a strong position to participate in that growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1166.95-1175.46: As we move forward, we expect the sales mix of products to normalize as Class A production and delivery schedules improve, and therefore, expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1175.48-1179.98: Segment margins in the mid single digits versus 10% achieved in Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.46-1183.22: On slide seven. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.78-1194.98: Consolidated full-year net sales declined 5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion in a challenging year that included expansion of production activities at our recreation segment at the onset of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.99-1198.98: And unplanned disruptions related to the pandemic at several other businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1199.42-1206.11: Adjusted EBITDA declined 34% compared to fiscal 2019 to $67.5 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.77-1215.54: Nearly $50 million or three-quarters of that total occurred in the second half of the year as revenue, throughput, and margins improved sequentially through the period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.24-1220.54: Rod mentioned a number of restructuring activities related to right-sizing the organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.94-1226.35: This included decentralizing the parts business from the corporate center back into the individual businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1226.37-1230.99: And sun setting less profitable brands and dealer relationships within the portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.35-1239.42: The total structural cost savings executed through our fiscal year end are expected to deliver a total of $10 million annually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1240.82-1242.74: Turning to slide eight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1242.76-1251.35: Full year net cash provided by operating activities was $56 million compared to $53 million of net cash provided in the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1251.85-1260.08: Cash generated was primarily related to improvements in accounts receivable and inventory management as well as an increase in customer deposits received. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1260.64-1268.53: We will continue to work all aspects of networking capital, including reinforcing the disciplines needed to reach optimal inventory levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.95-1276.38: Balancing accounts receivable and payable terms, and aligning more of our businesses with a model that collects a greater amount of customer deposits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.18-1286.49: That working capital at October 31st, 2020 was $355 million compared to $373 million at the end of fiscal 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.27-1298.22: Net debt as of October 31st was $331 million, including $11 million cash on hand versus $377 million at the end of fiscal 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.64-1306.25: At fiscal year end, the company maintained ample liquidity with $283 million available under our ABL revolving credit facility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1307.01-1320.52: You may recall that our term loan amendment effective in April of last year reverts to a net leverage ratio of 5.25 times with certain add backs related to Spartan acquisition in the fiscal first quarter of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1321.40-1327.59: We are confident that we will obtain this target. You may also recall that our term loan expires in April, 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1327.95-1333.11: We'll be working with our banking partners throughout the upcoming months to optimize our capital structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.74-1344.08: We do not plan to issue guidance today due to the recent recurrence of COVID-19 cases globally and within our business across the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1344.70-1347.25: The safety of our employees remains a top priority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1347.61-1356.44: Contact tracing, testing, and measures to prevent the spread of the virus come with uncertain staffing levels that impact our businesses and supply chain partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1356.84-1360.80: The CDC has issued and continues to update new directives that we follow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1361.18-1368.95: Under these conditions, our customers' ability to travel and inspect vehicles for acceptance creates uncertainty of delivery and revenue recognition timing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.27-1376.26: Until we can reasonably predict the potential impacts of these changes, we feel it would not be prudent to give a range of estimates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.04-1384.98: However, with the emergence of vaccines, we hope to have better clarity when we host our virtual investor and analyst day in April that Rod referenced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1385.55-1393.47: Please save the date on April 15th when we plan to provide a deeper look at our business and operating model and provide immediate term targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1393.85-1398.98: If we feel that the operating landscape has become more predictable, we expect to also provide full year guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1399.52-1405.69: We will extend a formal invitation to this event soon. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rod. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1407.11-1410.79: So I guess just a few closing comments then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.55-1416.28: So, you know, the fiscal year 2020 has been a challenging for the REV group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1416.30-1426.25: And our employees in many regards. We have gone through a number of internal changes as we move towards the future. We sold a business, purchased it, and integrated a business during that time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.27-1430.13: In which the exterior environment, as you all know, has been very often unpredictable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.73-1439.16: I'm pleased with the progress we've achieved in a short amount of time, given the amount of change we have experienced. Our businesses continue to have relatively healthy backlogs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.02-1442.70: And we believe they support revenue growth in the upcoming year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.22-1448.25: Most importantly, I'm very pleased with what our employees have done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1448.43-1454.39: They put themselves in a situation where they've delivered on everything they can to deliver on our commitments and deliver to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1454.41-1460.06: Under some very adverse circumstances as we look to support the first responders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.10-1464.42: In our country. So I'm very pleased and want to thank them publicly for what they've done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1464.62-1470.37: And with that, I think we'll hold it over and have a Q&A with an open mic. So questions, answers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1471.77-1476.70: Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.38-1480.44: A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1481.10-1484.66: You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.19-1491.41: And for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the start key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1492.01-1497.10: Please ask one question and one follow-up question and then requeue for additional questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.02-1502.86: Our first question is from Jerry Rivage with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.53-1509.09: Good morning everyone and congratulations on a really strong performance here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.29-1523.72: What really stood out was the margin performance in the RV business, and you alluded to mix helping. I'm wondering if we could just step through, you know, looking at the year-over-year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1524.64-1525.79: Margin expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.07-1535.42: How much of that was improved productivity? How much of that was pricing makes? And do we think about the mix tailwind as being sustainable from here? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.16-1539.78: Jerry, as I said in the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1539.96-1542.44: My prepared remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1542.48-1555.08: The mix really helps us and I think we've always said that outside of Class A, those are double digit performing businesses. So when you look at the mix there, our mix was down on Class A and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1555.12-1558.80: We really had two things helping us from a tailwind perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1559.00-1564.82: The fact that we had a larger mix in those more profitable businesses being the Class B, Cs and tollables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.35-1573.15: And class A actually had a high concentration of diesel product within the quarter, which is more profitable than the gas product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1573.33-1579.64: So even though we say COVID, a lot of the furniture issues we've had that we talked about previously were on our gas unit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.00-1586.79: Lines and so even within class A we had a margin pickup from the concentration of diesel within the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1586.85-1595.01: Which we would expect to more flatten out to a reasonable normalized rate going forward. And of course, as Class A continues to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1595.04-1600.66: Develop it'll get more to the 40 60 sort of split that we traditionally have seen within that group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.70-1607.21: So it really is just a matter of the amount that we sold within those other product categories plus the mixed benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1607.59-1616.92: And of course, as you saw within RV itself, the productivity improvements that they had drove a significant part of that 650 basis point improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1618.64-1620.56: Their sales are actually down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.62-1625.63: Go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1625.67-1634.87: I was saying the sales are actually down year on year, right? So they actually were able to deliver a profit that's a quarter versus less. So that was majority of that benefit was from productivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1637.12-1640.76: And in fire and emergency, nice to see Ocala turn the corner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1641.02-1660.00: Can you talk about how the production rates have continued into December? Have you continued to ramp higher or was the 40% increase essentially get you to a normalized run rate? And when do we see, from an accounting standpoint, the lower per unit costs flowing through to the full extent? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1661.72-1666.97: Well, I do think this is right. We have made considerable progress in that location. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1667.29-1675.98: But there's still opportunity for us to even do much better there. So we, as Mark mentioned in his earlier discussion, we've gotten back to more of a standard industry lead times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1676.30-1680.20: We continue to work on throughput on both aerials and pumpers in that plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1680.66-1686.21: And we believe there's opportunities for continued market expansion through productivity. So while we're pleased with the path we're on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.77-1692.43: And we're seeing this thing move and be able to look at our backlog and get to what we think is more of a standard lead time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.05-1701.58: We still believe there's opportunity to improve our efficiencies in that plant and get margin expansion in that business. So that's just work in front of us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1707.29-1713.87: Yes, thanks, sir. Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1715.48-1717.60: Hi, good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.62-1724.70: Questions. One, I think you noted on the commercial side you expected to see growth year-over-year. Just a clarification, I'm assuming that's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1724.72-1731.65: You know normalized for the divest share so look at sort of the ninety million quarterly run rate when you're talking about growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1732.57-1736.10: And I guess just my second question, can you just give more color? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.48-1744.38: Obviously the outlook on the bus side or the school bus side is somewhat uncertain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1744.40-1758.18: As you talk to customers, can you just talk about how they're thinking about buying trends in the latter part of the year? What would be the major drivers? What would they need to see to come back in the market and just sort of, you know, the overall age of the fleet? Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1759.92-1766.45: I think that this is right. The feedback we have from in markets or from dealer partners is that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.63-1773.05: The whole thing around school openings or schools that are open staying opening, that's the driving factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1773.61-1783.52: And right now there's just tremendous uncertainty around that. The back half of this year is going to shape out differently, obviously with the emergence of the multiple vaccines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1783.54-1788.53: And I think what's a real drive for people to get back in school from the public. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1788.65-1791.73: I think that's pretty clear that people want to go back to school. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1792.51-1800.16: That makes promise. We've got a couple things there I think could be tailwinds to help us get where we need to be. But we're going to know, I think, by the time we get together in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1801.00-1808.43: We're going to know how that shapes up, but right now there's just too much uncertainty for us to look forward and project what that school bus market's going to look like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1808.57-1811.07: Not knowing what the impacts of COVID is going to be until. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.09-1827.45: So we see the success rate on this virus and what that looks like and further moving into the spring when we typically see April, May being when we start getting significant orders and deliveries. So that will be a time frame we're going to know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1827.47-1829.37: But right now it's not clear. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1829.63-1834.41: Tremendous uncertainty, everybody's kind of awaiting that time period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.26-1844.60: And then just the commentary on revenues for commercial, assuming it excludes the divestiture, so look at the 90 million quarterly run rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.07-1852.91: And then my last question, how to think about the corporate expense line, you know, as we look to 2021, any color there. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.23-1858.92: So you're right on the commercial, that's exactly right, excluding the 90 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1859.06-1867.49: The corporate, of course, parts was part of the centralized, so that $5 million drops right to the corporate line, so you could see that $5 million drop. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1868.69-1874.47: That's where that was traditionally shown, the centralized parts business. Okay, great. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.54-1879.20: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1879.24-1887.01: Our next question is from Courtney Yakovonis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1889.17-1890.89: On the comment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1891.01-1895.28: But, you know, appreciate that, you know, there will be a mixed shift in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.30-1901.60: Recreation next year, I think you said you expect in line with the industry wholesale shipments up about 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1902.24-1910.87: But I think you had said that you were expecting mid-single-digit margins, and I think we've historically been seeing more high single-digit out of that segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1911.33-1914.93: I just wanted to make sure I fully understood what you were saying. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1915.06-1921.36: What you were thinking the next shift impact would have on 2021, given that Class A has been weak. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1921.38-1922.48: For some time now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1923.64-1933.37: We've traditionally seen mid single digits, so what we determine as mid, 5-7%, so that's probably in line with what we've historically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.39-1938.72: Done, but the mix shift really is what I referred to with Jerry's question is, again,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.74-1943.88: 40% of our sales being in the RV or our class A business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1943.96-1949.49: You know, those, as you know, are depressed margins, so those bring down the ones that are double digit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1949.51-1952.85: From a run rate perspective. So it's really the fact that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1952.87-1961.02: RV, what we call RV, our class A was actually down from a mix, so as they come more to the 40 to 50 percent,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.04-1968.07: Range, they were 40% in the quarter versus 50% in the prior year, so you had a 10% drop there from a mixed perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1968.39-1976.44: And so it's really that simple as far as looking at the other three businesses that we have in that portfolio at double digit and bringing in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1976.46-1978.68: Lower single-digit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1978.72-1984.34: Mix from the class A will actually depress those 10% down to more of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1984.66-1986.51: 5 to 7 percent range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1988.09-1989.69: That's helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.73-2000.46: Any more specificity you could give us just on commercial and F&E margins as we think about impact next year? Obviously, appreciating that it's going to be dependent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.48-2004.62: On your delivery schedule, but any high level thoughts on the margin side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2007.49-2014.75: I think we said high single digits from that whole commercial side, but obviously on the capacity, if you're talking about capacity, that's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.52-2021.10: That's one we're still with the backlog here, so as I said in my prepared remarks, we took the opportunity to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.12-2046.27: A lot of the units that we had developed coming into what our normal selling season is didn't develop, but exiting the quarter we were very happy with some of the progress we made and our backlog is now performing so we should see the variability get out of there. But when you look at the total commercial segment, we would expect the high single, sort of what we were expecting coming into the quarter if we wouldn't have had the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2046.29-2050.85: Issues that we experience on the commercial side and liquidation that we did on some of those stock units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2050.95-2058.72: So we would expect it to get more like we guided to last time, more of the mid or the high single digits for the commercial segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.00-2077.86: Okay, gotcha. And then I guess just lastly, you know, you mentioned, you know, concerns about delivery schedules for next year, but if you had to just highlight, you know, what are the three categories that has the most variability or you're most concerned about versus the ones that are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2078.12-2083.96: That you feel most confident in the delivery schedules for next year, just so we can get a sense of where the real risk is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.21-2089.05: By categories, you mean the business units or the product categories? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2090.31-2094.41: I guess I just meant within the business unit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2094.45-2096.06: Obviously, your recreation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.10-2105.03: That clog is pretty strong. So do you feel like that's where you have the most certainty versus some of the product lines? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2105.07-2106.81: In FME and commercial. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.43-2113.05: I think that, you know, and I'll comment and Mark can clean up what I say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2113.07-2122.90: When you think about in-markets that are affected by the issues, I think primarily, obviously, in-market demand in the school bus businesses is the issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2123.48-2133.37: All the businesses are subject to some level of supplier issues that we're dealing with. I think RV is probably the one that we've seen the most stock out, which is pretty consistent across the industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2134.47-2139.54: The other element that we deal with a little bit, which is a timing issue, not a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2139.58-2149.05: Impact probably within the fiscal year is just the inspections that have to take place in ambulance and fire around getting a bus off the lot or a truck or an ambulance off the lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2149.89-2153.63: Related to completing final inspections by getting people to the site. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2153.67-2160.74: That's a real issue that we've been dealing with in terms of revenue recognition because that has to happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2160.76-2163.52: In order for us to convert the bus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.56-2165.21: In school bus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.49-2172.33: It certainly is in market demand. There's some supplier issues that are spread throughout that we've been able to overcome for the most part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2172.81-2176.44: But they do pop up and we have to work through that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2177.32-2185.27: And then the last thing would be the businesses that are subject to inspections, which is your emergency segment is where we see that at. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.65-2192.89: I think that's right. I think as we said previously, one of the things that we thought would happen here with COVID as people converted, like people working from home,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.21-2199.48: We expected that more people would adopt virtual inspections for our ambulance and fire trucks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2199.50-2200.64: Exiting COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2200.98-2204.44: Our customers have come back to wanting to see their trucks in person. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.70-2206.81: And what's this resurgence here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2206.87-2213.47: We're hoping that they'll go back to virtual, but we have shifted back to wanting to do in-person inspections. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2213.53-2223.02: So we haven't seen them going back to virtual. So obviously there is some flux there if people would go back to virtual inspections depending on what happens with the COVID environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2223.42-2230.49: But we are back to our traditional, as Rob referred to, actually seeing the units before they leave the yard so that we can revenue them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.53-2238.54: And that's really the delays that I was speaking to of. It's really our customers coming in and inspecting the units and approving them for shipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.22-2248.55: Great, thanks. As a reminder, the star 1 on your telephone keypad, if you would like to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.99-2252.21: Our next question is from Raj Patel with Jeffreys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.67-2256.12: Please proceed. Hey, thanks for taking the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2257.44-2259.54: Just a quick one on F and E margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2259.56-2269.23: We anticipated F&E margin expansion once all the production inefficiencies are sorted out. What do you think the new margin profile looks like in a new normal? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.28-2285.91: From a fire perspective, obviously as Rod has reiterated multiple times, we're still in a multiple ending journey here. So as he referred to on the E1,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2286.63-2296.00: We still have a lot of work to do. We're seeing progression, but of course, we have other facilities within the portfolio too that we're going to address, as I said in my prepared remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2296.56-2298.40: Expecting to be in the double digits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2298.64-2302.00: At the end of this journey, but we're still working through that, right? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.20-2311.03: Of course, we're not giving guidance here, but again, it's still in a multiple year perspective to get to that 10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.05-2314.47: Happy to see the progression here that we've seen throughout the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2314.53-2320.38: And obviously, our forward-looking will provide more guidance in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2321.34-2322.38: I think that it's a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2322.74-2331.39: When you think about operational improvements and how you walk down that, what Mark referred to as a multi-entered journey, when you come into the role, you're. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.47-2334.99: There are some quick things you can do to get POP and get improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2335.44-2339.50: And then it's about building capabilities. And I mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2339.68-2345.43: Standing up the lean capabilities and center-led type activities that get implemented in the plants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2345.45-2352.35: Around CI, around purchasing, building engineering capabilities to get a design cost through VAVE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2353.37-2356.52: Those are things that you have to do some capability building. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2356.68-2366.63: The good thing is that it's a continually improved process where you're going to be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute again. So we're in the process right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2366.65-2369.09: Coming out of our operating model discussion of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2369.11-2382.58: Of standing up those capabilities and building out those teams and doing the certifications that Mark talked about through Lean that are going to yield benefit to us for a very, very long time. Things that did not exist, now we're standing up those capabilities and bringing on Rob. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.66-2387.31: To lead a purchasing organization and get focus on that significant spend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2388.07-2395.06: I think it's going to yield great benefit to us too. So those will all contribute to a margin expansion story, not only in emergency, but across the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.52-2403.58: So that's, but it does take work to stand it up. It starts with organizing and aligning and investing in those capability building and then driving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2403.60-2405.81: It through process, rigor, each step. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2405.85-2406.95: Each day, each week, each month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2415.84-2418.84: The next question is from Ms. Dobley with Baird. Please proceed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2421.06-2422.24: Thanks, morning guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2423.30-2424.52: One question on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.23-2427.05: A quick question on chassis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2427.15-2436.56: As you're looking at your current production planning based on your backlog, are there any portions in your business where you're getting a sense that you're having. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2436.58-2442.64: Either challenges obtaining chassis or the delivery timelines are extended. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.04-2449.91: And look, I mean, I'm thinking specifically around ambulances and some of the stuff in recreation as well, like, you know, class Bs and so on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2453.13-2461.36: Yeah, no, Meg, I'm glad to say we're not experiencing those. In fact, we've had a pretty good supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.38-2465.87: Chain from that perspective. So I was happy this quarter not to be talking about chassis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2465.91-2467.21: Shortages for once. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2467.35-2468.75: Even though it's only my second one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2469.39-2473.51: So I know you've heard that consistently, so we've been very happy with that. In fact,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.93-2476.88: In the RV side especially, we... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2476.96-2482.90: We took advantage of what our run rates were going to be and actually ordered ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2482.92-2494.57: Sitting with plenty of chassis from that perspective in that business. And then on the ambulance side, we haven't had any issues from a chassis perspective. We've been getting our appropriate allocations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2494.59-2496.90: From our OE partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2499.78-2506.33: Helpful. And then maybe my follow-up, sort of sticking with this theme, how do you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.39-2512.21: How do you think about steel prices and raw material inflation in 2021? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2513.37-2516.94: What are some of the steps that you take to mitigate this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.96-2523.52: Obviously, historically, this has been an area where we've seen some trouble in prior years. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.13-2530.91: So I mean, obviously, on the parts of our business, which a large part of our business is built out of backlog. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2531.77-2540.70: There's always the issue you're trying to offset inflation with your efficiency efforts because your purchase price is established on a backlog-based business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2541.18-2550.47: We're managing that. Obviously a big part of what Rob's efforts is going to be is to look at new purchasing to be able to offset that within a fiscal year so we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2550.49-2554.35: Cycle through and get the margins that we need on a price cost basis, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.97-2565.01: So it's a lot around driving efficiency to make sure that we're doing everything we can to optimize our cost structure to have any leakage that does come through inflation into a backlog-based business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.03-2566.99: We can offset through other means. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.01-2569.13: Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything to that or... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2569.75-2578.08: I think that's right and that's one of the things that I'm working personally with Rob on, make sure we understand those inflationary factors as we go through 2021 as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2578.10-2582.14: Our agreements with our supply base and that's one of the things that the ROBS can acclimate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2582.16-2584.40: There's obviously a heightened focus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.44-2588.95: In those businesses where we don't have the longer backlogs, we obviously come out with some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2588.97-2595.54: Price increases as our competitors have, so we're managing that with the supply base as well as our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2596.36-2597.98: I do think one of the things, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2598.56-2599.98: Many things we're working on is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2600.60-2605.31: Is trying to get in front of how we think about price as a function of inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.81-2615.40: And to make sure when you think about a price increase or setting a price in the market that you're thinking about the build cycle of when that vehicle will get built. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2615.96-2620.86: So you reflect some inflationary characteristics in your costing in the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2620.98-2629.69: Most of our businesses have done that to some degree, but that's just something I think that we've got to get great around because when you're working on a backlog-based business and you're doing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2629.73-2632.13: Selling forward projection on deliveries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2632.51-2645.41: You got to be thinking about the inflationary times that you're in and making sure that you're costing that vehicle such that by the time you're doing the bill or you're shipping the vehicle that you've anticipated any inflationary costs in your price and costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2648.19-2652.57: Absolutely, I understand that. I guess I'm just wondering, based on what you know today,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2653.25-2658.52: Do you believe you're going to be in a position where you can be neutral from a price-cost standpoint? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.84-2662.72: Going forward or should we try to bake in some kind of a headwind? Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2663.16-2669.39: Yeah, I think based on the data we have now relative to price cost, the efficiency efforts that we've got in the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2669.41-2675.00: Should yield us a minimum neutrality in our performance going forward in the fiscal year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2678.48-2692.29: Good luck, guys. Thanks, Mick. As a reminder, just star 1 on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2692.65-2696.22: We will pause for a brief moment to pull for final questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2703.62-2708.19: There are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rod for closing comments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.45-2714.07: Well, thank you again for joining. I appreciate the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.26-2720.66: Again, I want to take a moment as we close out of fiscal year and a nine-month period for myself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2720.68-2728.33: Think about all the changes that we've made both in process and structure and people to thank our team for what's been a pretty whirlwind year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.59-2736.14: Considering all the external situations that all of us have dealt with on top of that new leadership coming in and expecting to do things a different way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2736.16-2740.54: And maybe change some thinking. I want to compliment our leadership team and also thank our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2740.56-2748.99: Front-line employees and what they've done to serve our customers and also serve this nation and getting these necessary vehicles out to our communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2749.31-2756.36: Again, I appreciate your time today. I look forward to seeing you all in April when we'll have a deeper discussion around where we're taking this business going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2756.98-2759.02: Have a great day and have a great weekend. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2760.66-2765.99: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation. 
asr:0: END
