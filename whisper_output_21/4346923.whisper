asr:0: OUTPUT 1099.50-1109.45: Unfortunately, these results were still lower than the first quarter of 2019, in part due to the quarantine measures, but mostly due to the overall market condition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1110.43-1115.90: In Panama and the fact that prices in Honduras continue to be lower than the average price of 20. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1117.42-1127.13: As a result, cement volumes decreased 4.1% and ready-mix volumes decreased 34.1% when compared to the first quarter of 2019.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.58-1181.60: We believe that the second trimester of this year will continue to be challenging for the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1182.02-1190.77: But maintain our cautious optimism on the second half of the year due to the fact that economies such as Panama, Honduras and Puerto Rico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.79-1192.75: Took early actions on lockdowns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1192.83-1197.40: And quarantine measures and in that sense we expect an early recovery in those economies.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1532.81-1542.58: First of all, I would like to clarify a couple of points. I think you mentioned the target of production of Capex of 40 million this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.38-1552.19: I just would like to understand, is it 40 million less than last year or 40 million less than the guidance that you had given in February? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1553.51-1563.08: And the second point I would like to clarify is on pricing in Colombia. I think you mentioned an increase of FWC... Four, hi. ...13 points.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1588.91-1596.38: 40 million less than last year or is it 40 million less than the guidance that you gave in February? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1597.28-1600.00: And the second point is on the pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.54-1607.61: In Colombia, I think you mentioned an increase of 13.5% of prices in Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1608.25-1610.71: But you're mentioning FOB proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.57-1617.12: I would like to understand, is it your own selling prices or are we talking about import prices?

asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.11-1662.86: The second part of the question was about the pricing in Colombia. You mentioned an increase of 13% of FOB prices in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1662.90-1670.31: But I just would like to understand whether we are talking about import prices or your own selling prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1680.00-1684.24: I'm going to ask you to provide us any words of the question about rising figures in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.21-1694.61: The entire dynamic is one year old, it's still in use. We were able to describe it for people who are still in the end of March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.95-1698.84: The argument that we are pursuing here, we are pursuing this issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1698.86-1705.75: Continue with that kind of going forward, starting in the third quarter of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.77-1709.43: And you must start to record a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.45-1711.53: Evaluation of the Columbia in person. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1711.95-1720.02: The gap of the internal crisis is a reason for why the crisis has widened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.14-1728.47: Using all the opportunities to move forward with strategies for equity and equality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1729.47-1734.03: I.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.67-1771.03: Just very quickly, two questions. First on the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.07-1779.80: I was wondering what the plans are for the refinancing or the kicking back of maturities that are on the balance sheet for 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.30-1786.05: And I guess similarly how conversations with creditors are going on waiving covenants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.49-1792.05: And then just on the operating side, you mentioned in the release and in your remarks on the call, Frank, that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1792.07-1800.42: That you were expecting other countries in the Caribbean and Central American region to follow Panama's lead on imposing import tariffs for cement? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.96-1812.71: I was wondering whether that's sort of an expectation based on your reading of the markets or whether there's actual tangible comments or progress made by some of these markets already on this front. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1818.92-1820.12: Please stop by your instrument. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.14-1831.47: A question and then I will ask Camille to leave a comment on the MLI and we can start the MLI conversation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1832.33-1841.10: In the reality, with this pandemic, we are seeing an increase of awareness of the local governments to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1841.12-1845.79: You can see by here, the image is a depiction of the medical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1846.67-1855.04: And the protection of employment in the local markets. And that means that they will be paid with local producers, PWs, and importers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.56-1864.96: We have seen that already in Panama with 30% increase in the men and we have seen that in Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.87-1872.03: So we have high expectations based on the things that we have seen in the interviews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1873.99-1878.38: For the second person, I would like Kat to give you more color. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.88-1883.44: I think I've got a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.50-1893.13: I think it is very important to point out or to start saying that when this crisis started for us in March 20th. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1893.91-1901.26: We have about $330 million of maturities for the rest of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.68-1903.06: So far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.18-1908.93: We have rolled over about $115 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1909.09-1919.32: With different tenors up to two years, in other cases, two or three months of maturity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1919.38-1928.57: We have lost over 100% of the facilities that we had to roll over. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.59-1937.22: And really, we like what Sam mentioned in the conference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1937.54-1947.53: We are in permanent contact with the different banks. The support has been great of all of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1948.95-1956.34: In the second part of the question about the waiver, we are starting the conversation with the creditors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1957.64-1962.22: Creditors because we are requesting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1962.34-1968.07: A labor for the next quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1970.01-1971.53: Already in this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1971.89-1974.39: This is not very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.73-1976.42: The rest of the situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1977.20-1981.20: A very general situation in the market right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1982.72-1989.33: The good thing is that remember in the presentation that we were in a very big trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.47-1992.79: And then the big video, I mean, that we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.97-1995.08: We ended March with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1995.22-1999.30: Very close to four times the negative rigidum of the leaf. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1999.32-2007.19: Because of these prices, we are expecting to increase this level of operation, of the ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2007.81-2013.03: But we are very optimistic about the negotiation with our creditors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2014.91-2019.20: That's very clear. Thank you both very much and keep well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.62-2022.08: OK, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2023.70-2029.13: Thank you. Our next question is from Adrián Huerta with JPMorgan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.41-2036.32: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had one question on the cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2036.74-2039.34: You can just provide us with more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.36-2046.99: Comments on where this fixed cost that you're planning to cut to come from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.63-2052.15: And then the second question that I had was if you can just... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.17-2063.04: Tell us what happened to the price increases that you had planned in the US for April and which price increases you have executed already and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2063.06-2066.47: And what you're planning to do for the rest of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.17-2076.70: Good morning, Adrian, and thank you for the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2078.30-2087.57: The reality is that we have become really good at optimizing all the predations in the last few years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.11-2093.17: And with the challenges that we are facing from COVID-19 in our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2093.87-2100.24: We really need to continue accelerating the optimization of our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.96-2108.37: The savings will come from savings in maintenance and services and in HG&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2109.15-2114.93: Totaling close to between 75 and 100 million dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2115.54-2123.96: We are fully confident that we will be able to achieve that target for the machinaries that we are foreseeing going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2124.58-2130.55: The savings will come from the US and from Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2132.07-2141.54: In terms of the price scenario in the US, I would like to be more clear about what we are seeing in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2142.98-2150.33: Adrian, hey, good morning. As far as price, as you suggested, we were looking for a price increase April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2151.17-2157.82: The reality is that we had some good success early in a couple of markets, mainly Florida and Dallas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2159.72-2168.69: Unfortunately, given the situation rolling into the spring, we pushed out the increase that was going to be a strong move in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.27-2177.96: And we're monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see what happened or going down with what's happening with the virus and the impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2179.14-2186.03: But right now we're looking at something in the late second quarter maybe to push another price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2189.79-2196.04: Perfect, thank you. And, Emilio, if I can just, on the cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2196.60-2202.38: The lower cost for maintenance, not just for this year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2202.44-2207.27: Or will those ones that we see great volumes will have to be... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2207.29-2209.17: Will have to be expensed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.05-2219.26: It will depend on the scenario that is at that plane. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.90-2224.50: But we are certainly confident that we will be able to achieve these aims for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.29-2237.20: For the following year it will depend on the number of plants that we will have in operations according to the report of the month. Understood. Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.42-2246.27: Thank you. And our next question is from Alexandra Obregon with Morgan Stanley. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2247.85-2250.29: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the call and for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2250.97-2260.86: It's really related to what you're seeing on the ground. So you did mention that volumes in Central America and the Caribbean are about 40% of volumes of a regular month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2261.20-2267.29: So just wondering if you could add some commentary there for Colombia and the U.S. Of what you're seeing for April and May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2272.53-2282.30: Thank you for your question. I would like to ask Tomás to give you an idea of how are you doing things evolving in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2285.01-2287.71: Hello, Alexandra. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2288.05-2297.24: So in April, we had the first half of the month was pretty much at full stop. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2297.72-2305.69: Only a few dispatches for infrastructure projects that were able to continue operating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2306.11-2313.97: But by the end of the month, we were already reaching the 40% of our daily dispatches. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2314.51-2319.14: So April turns out better than we thought. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2320.02-2326.47: Basically, we have twice as much volume as we expected during the quarantine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2326.91-2334.31: In the month of May, we are seeing our volumes around 50% of what they used to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2335.26-2339.96: To do a little more and to give you some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2339.98-2341.96: More color about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2342.00-2351.25: We're seeing, you know, surprisingly, a great deal of activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2351.39-2355.48: You know, compared to what we were expecting in the retail business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2355.72-2365.33: Which has become so far the majority, you know, the larger than even the industrial dispatches we are doing right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.65-2380.12: So as of May 11th, when dispatches in Bogota and many other cities and all retail stores around the country should become available and online,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2380.54-2385.63: We are seeing volumes growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2386.01-2391.63: To a little bit more than half of what we were dispatching in the previous month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2394.09-2400.44: Now Bill could you provide us some color about the volumes and videos in APLE which we are very pleased to have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.30-2404.88: Sure, thanks, Dawn and Alexander. Thank you for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2405.59-2410.07: Actually, April was much stronger than we anticipated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.79-2416.38: I think initially there was some forecast where you may have weakening demand towards the latter half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2416.94-2423.66: We were pleased that our volumes ended very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2424.12-2425.33: So far this month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.81-2434.05: We're seeing another sign of optimism, at least for the first week. Our volumes are tracking pretty close to plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.79-2442.46: And we do see in the future that there's going to be some level of slowdown in the residential segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2442.64-2457.44: I think probably to begin with and then maybe the commercial backlog as it works off, it could slow. But at this point, it's kind of hard to predict when that might occur because at this point, we thought we may see some slowdown already, but we have not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2457.64-2466.79: The impact that we've had so far has been more weather related. So again, we're encouraged at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2466.81-2469.17: Looking forward to see what's going to happen the rest of this month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.65-2473.29: Thank you. We love you, too. Compliment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.97-2482.70: The answer on the Camilo Candico virus with some color about what's going on in our markets in Central America and the Caribbean in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2484.02-2491.51: Sure Juan. Alexandra showed the point presented a broad estimate but in more detail on Duras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2491.83-2499.14: In 15 days of opening during April, we were able to dispatch around 50% of our budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2500.00-2512.29: Panama, as we said, is still closed and we have still dispatched it, but we have news that the economy will reopen next week, starting with construction as one of the sectors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2512.43-2513.47: That reopens. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2513.85-2516.70: So that's a positive, a little news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.82-2525.91: AT is at 100% of budget and has been for the first four months of the year and the land is still strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.53-2531.47: For Dominican Republic, we did about 40% of our normal dispatches. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2531.81-2537.12: And this with the construction at a halt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2537.44-2550.83: And this was mainly due to dispatches to people that were doing inventory for bricks and other small construction. So that's positive also for the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2552.07-2561.22: Puerto Rico has had a very long closure, but the government has at different points in time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2561.34-2569.15: We opened some areas, for example, small hardware stores with initial dispatches two days a week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2569.43-2576.22: And that, along with exports, represented about 25% of the budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.70-2584.58: And it also positive that Puerto Rico will reopen the construction sector also starting next week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.13-2593.93: The teams which had also closure in most of the islands, the budget was around 40% as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2594.29-2601.02: And then we have Suriname with 85% of budget, so just a 15% decline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2601.06-2610.99: French bullion was at 105% of the budget, so even though that there were measures taken by the government, we did not see a decrease in demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2611.61-2616.20: And the rest of the export markets were about 70%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2616.56-2626.31: So, we are seeing a May with better demand that we had before April. So, that's encouraging news. Next one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2630.11-2634.53: Thank you very much. This was very clear. And just a quick follow-up on your savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2635.72-2645.01: Is it fair to assume that it will be proportionally split in all the countries? I mean, the $75 to $90 million, would it be proportional all across the U.S., Colombia, and the Caribbean? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2649.85-2658.64: We are expecting the highest savings in Colombia, followed by the US and then by the CCA, Alexander. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2660.94-2669.93: Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Roberto Paniagua with Corfu Colombiana. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2678.24-2682.96: To the summit prize in Colombia. I want to know the answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2689.85-2693.31: I'm sorry, but we can listen to you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2700.56-2705.21: Are you speaking louder? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2711.07-2714.39: Okay, okay. Thank you. I'm sorry for the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.26-2721.36: I have just a few questions. The first one, can you tell me the quarterly semifinal variations in Colombia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2721.68-2729.33: The second is about any market share loss that you could have in Colombia in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2729.35-2733.59: Due to the entrance of a new competitor. And the last one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.67-2737.32: The project's destination in Colombia. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2747.31-2752.79: Thank you for recording. Human price war is in Colombia, 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2754.47-2762.28: We continue deploying with a lot of success our strategy of leading the price recovery in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2763.68-2770.99: You may have a list of, you know, very slightly market sharing in business in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2771.85-2781.02: It was growing in excess of 7% per month through the end of February and we were basically flat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2782.08-2787.01: I'm very pleased with the success of our study with graduate colleagues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2789.51-2798.92: We will have to wait until we have more visibility in the second quarter, but we are very pleased with our market position in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2802.68-2807.13: I don't know if Thomas you would like to add a little bit more color to the arm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2809.29-2811.97: More about the 4G plug-in for some nations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2813.01-2818.02: We are seeing all of the projects going strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2818.40-2826.47: Financially solid still and we see all of our customers very busy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2827.47-2834.17: Taking care of their employees with all these very demanding protocols of health and safety. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2834.27-2842.04: And we are still seeing 4G as a main driver of demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2845.29-2846.67: That's pretty much what I wanted to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2866.45-2868.49: Roberto, does that answer your question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2875.03-2880.18: Thank you. And our next question is from Juan Diaz with Porvenir. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2882.60-2886.41: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the presentation. I have two questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2887.01-2893.55: My first question is, could you expand more on the construction of the net debt to be the post-dividends ratio in dollars? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2894.03-2903.54: And what would this indicator be including IFRS 16 and using adjusted EBITDA and what are the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year with regard to rating agencies? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2904.60-2914.35: And my second question is what is the medium term liquidity strategy and outlook considering that the dividend payments that should happen in the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2915.24-2919.58: Were to be supported by the postponed divestitures. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2924.44-2931.73: Thank you, Pablo, for the question. Carlos, would you like to answer the first one about the death rate evaluation? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2936.56-2938.56: Exactly the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2942.80-2945.73: I would like to know, for example, in what... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2945.79-2955.54: What I understood in the last report from rating agencies, they don't make a division on IFRS 16 or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.56-2956.64: Or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2956.72-2960.00: And one for that side and the other thing was on... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2965.35-2973.67: Because the rating agency didn't exclude the area of an existing asset or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2977.30-2984.36: Here the fully IFRX 16 is very similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2984.50-2988.33: Is pretty similar because our ratio, just taking into account the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2988.39-2995.64: The debt related to assets per use between us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2995.68-3003.36: Divided by the depreciation plus amortization plus the interest because of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3003.78-3012.43: Is released right now four times for that reason including the ARX 15. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3012.61-3016.90: The ratio is really close to 4 times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3025.57-3031.43: Aware of the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3033.49-3035.66: We are mentioning the ugly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3036.36-3037.76: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3037.88-3039.08: The GDP of the developed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3039.44-3053.51: The second quarter and the third quarter, obviously right now is very complex for that reason we are taking all these measures like the CAPEX, the CAPEX code. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3053.65-3056.44: And the course savings and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.50-3060.92: A lot of other measures in terms of the liquidity you ask. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3061.02-3062.76: I live whatever the week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3063.20-3070.89: Our current position in liquidity is about 500, 550. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3071.83-3074.41: You know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3078.38-3083.32: Really the idea is to end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3083.60-3091.87: Second quarter with a bow in a very stressful scenario. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3092.39-3097.96: We are with about 300 million pesos really. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3098.50-3099.58: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3099.72-3107.21: Important to highlight what Juan Espera and Tomás, Billy and Camilo have mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3107.77-3111.93: That comparing the one stressful scenario with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3111.95-3119.72: In reality April was by far better than our initial scenario. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3120.28-3121.80: Aunt May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3121.82-3129.49: Is going better by far as well. For that reason we are expecting that we are ending in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3130.07-3134.35: Get a better position in terms of liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3139.38-3142.46: We monitor the cash provision of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3142.78-3150.87: Week by week going forward depending on how things will play out. We are confident that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3151.09-3156.26: As Carlos is saying, we will be able to end the quarter with a very good cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3164.46-3169.67: Thank you. Our next question is from Rodrigo Sanchez with David Vienda Correo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3172.89-3176.58: Good morning and thank you for the presentation. I also have two questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3177.90-3183.74: In addition to the funds already secured as of April, Carlos comments on expected liquidity levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3184.74-3188.59: Are you expecting to report further deaths increases throughout the rest of the year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3188.69-3195.12: And also, could you please mention the amount you still have available to secure credit line? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3196.76-3204.82: My second question is I understand that the shares you own in Grupo Sura are used as collateral for the credit license you have in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3205.39-3212.41: And will you be restrained to sell them or at least part of it if you needed to do so? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3221.72-3223.22: Part of the day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3223.32-3232.43: First part of the question, Rodrigo, we are, we are, I think we are high level of programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3233.05-3240.00: We are devoting tomorrow another extra 15 million dollars that now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3243.72-3245.95: Are on in Trudeau. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3246.33-3252.29: We don't need this extra. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3253.23-3261.06: Really we prefer to have this extra liquid in our hands. We are using this extra liquid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3262.44-3265.39: Not contemplated in the previous that we were mentioning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3268.45-3271.07: With this new deadline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3271.51-3279.60: We will be in a very good position of liquidity for many months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3283.78-3290.71: We don't have any collateralized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3310.41-3314.29: Our next question is from Alejandro Chavela with Credit Suisse. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3318.32-3321.10: For taking my question. Stay safe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3321.92-3330.87: Just on competitive dynamics in Colombia, I know you already mentioned a little bit, but if you could comment a little bit with regards to the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3330.89-3339.26: The improvement that you are seeing in import pricing and the slight market share loss that you had in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3339.34-3347.13: Could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share or what are you seeing from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3347.15-3352.73: From the market as a whole with the price increase that you made in the first quarter. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3357.50-3359.88: Thank you Alejandro. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3359.98-3366.39: Colombia was behaving in a very good way until the first half of March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3366.41-3373.65: With the increase in demand of last year close to 500,000 tons plus the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3373.67-3376.76: So I am focusing on increasing the money through February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3376.88-3383.00: The reality is that the competitive banks had also, in my opinion, a positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3383.90-3386.07: Nobody was really competing on price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3386.17-3387.99: It's a huge gap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3388.07-3392.37: In presently happy days, import policy crisis and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3392.39-3394.27: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3394.29-3402.78: For everybody to rework the cost of capital of the assets that we have in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3404.04-3412.91: I would expect that scenario to continue the same way going forward once they might start to recover. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3413.57-3416.34: So, far do I extremely please with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3416.38-3420.02: The action of the market in April and in May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3420.40-3428.63: And in our opinion our competitive position has strength in this restart of the economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3429.21-3436.66: The close relationships that we have with our clients and the technical assistance that we provide to them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3437.08-3441.98: In that opinion have a superior value proposition for the industry segment of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3442.56-3447.51: And we are the only cement player in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3447.53-3454.61: Who access directly a wider range of hardware resources in the conscious way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3455.88-3459.64: You know, going directly to more than 5,000 hybrid storks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3460.00-3467.03: So in our opinion, our value proposition will be an important asset for us going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3468.17-3477.12: We don't foresee anybody continuing prices no matter what scenario of demand plays out going forward. It's just the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3477.14-3479.10: Significant gap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3479.12-3482.16: In private designers in the time of the price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3483.74-3487.45: Of what I wanted to write during this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3487.77-3495.76: We gained market share in the industrial business where we suffered the most by the end of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3496.64-3498.84: Particularly in the RenuMix business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3499.28-3508.59: We are as strong as we've always been in the industrial part of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3509.43-3515.14: The loss of market share has been mostly focused on the retail business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3515.64-3521.00: But it's where we have been recovering prices faster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3521.20-3526.63: We have gone as usual faster than our competitors in that market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3529.11-3535.50: And I think it's pretty much a very good move to have done it before this crisis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3536.42-3544.28: Because otherwise our competitors will be, as Juan was saying, forced or... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3544.30-3545.49: In sanctuaries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3545.51-3555.12: To recover value as well for their companies in a more stressful market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3555.16-3559.74: So we are we are poised to recover the market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3560.50-3562.62: With healthier prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3563.10-3565.61: You know, as we are seeing today and... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3565.63-3574.29: You know, import parity prices have been a very good indicator of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3574.31-3578.44: You know, that direction where the national crisis should go. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3578.74-3581.56: And in this case, this is pointing in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3581.58-3589.31: In the right direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3591.95-3596.78: Thank you. Our next question is from Stefania Mosquera with Credit Corp. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3599.56-3602.02: Thank you very much for the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3602.18-3603.94: I have two questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3604.28-3609.61: My first question is regarding the distribution of your cash codes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3609.65-3614.75: What proportion would you say is fixed and what proportion would you say is variable? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3615.60-3622.38: And then my second question is regarding the competitive dynamics in Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3622.88-3627.77: You mentioned in the presentation that you had price decreases, so I would like to have a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3627.79-3636.36: Little bit more detail in that front. Thank you, Estefan Nersold, for your. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3638.04-3641.94: The cost of our biologics is more or less 50%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3646.27-3656.08: Regarding Honduras, the reality is that we started to see the dynamic in the market in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3656.70-3664.72: January and February were very good months in terms of demand, so things were going way better in Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3665.21-3669.49: And with the recovery of the market that Camilo mentioned in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3670.21-3679.72: We still don't have enough visibility and we need more weeks to really know what is going to be like the normal demand in Honduras again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3680.00-3683.66: But up to now we are pleased with the dynamics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3684.14-3688.95: If the market continues recording. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3688.97-3700.00: We foresee a scenario in which we can start a price recovery strategy in Honduras similar to the one that we are executing in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3700.90-3703.88: I don't know, can you, if you would like to add some quality? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3708.31-3711.43: Just to mention that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3711.65-3716.46: And there's previously others as well, but the tariff is something that is being discussed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3716.94-3723.60: So that could potentially benefit as well the direction of the prices in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3724.90-3726.51: And again,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3726.61-3733.93: Starting on December, following through to the middle of March, we had a very strong demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3733.95-3737.40: In the country, which I think is very positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3737.54-3747.35: See how the recovery goes and what programs the government implements to recover the economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3747.67-3748.73: But... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3748.79-3760.08: But definitely construction sector for a country like Honduras is a critical sector to restart and to secure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3760.38-3762.44: As part of their job score. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3770.07-3773.93: Thank you. Our next question is from Andres Soto with Santa. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3776.38-3778.56: Good morning everybody and thank you for the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3780.00-3786.17: Your comments about significant decline of cement and tinker imports in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3786.21-3792.97: This year and also the tariffs that were implemented in Panama potentially to be implemented in Honduras as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3793.35-3800.40: So I would like to understand how much imports represent from each of those markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3800.72-3807.73: How much importers either cement or tin can represent of the Colombian cement market as of 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3808.09-3813.21: And if you guys share the same number for Panama and Honduras, it will be very helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3820.00-3821.36: And it is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3823.10-3830.75: Importing into Colombia, mainly clinker last year close to 600,000 tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3832.47-3838.20: To Honduras and Panama close to 8% of the market in each of those markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3838.86-3844.14: Panama, cement and Honduras as well, only cement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3845.11-3851.17: In our opinion, there is a trend in our conscious towards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3851.19-3855.78: You know, supporting local industries just to protect employment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3856.54-3862.44: And especially in places such as Colombia where the prices are way below the poverty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3863.08-3871.99: If that makes any sense for the country to use foreign reserves to import clinker when. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3872.05-3881.84: We have enough local capacity to supply the industry, local integrated producers. So in our opinion,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3882.24-3884.74: That we're pretty very going. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3893.11-3898.00: Thank you. Our next question is from Francisco Suarez with Scotiabank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3900.52-3906.49: Thank you for the call this morning. I hope you are doing well in KSP and you're well at your loved ones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3907.43-3911.05: Congrats on the nice performance on margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3911.13-3918.46: In Colombo despite the huge drop in volumes. That tells you a little bit about what you're doing. Congrats on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3919.32-3922.06: Courses that I have on the United States first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3922.10-3934.85: What will it take commercially to be ready to be better positioned to sell more cement to readiness infrastructure projects? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3935.16-3937.26: And secondly,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3937.36-3948.41: Do you think that the overall performance in densely populated regions in the United States. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3948.47-3955.78: Might be affected more compared to other regions within the United States. Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3959.98-3962.80: Thank you, Patu, thank you for your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3963.02-3970.07: I was very pleased with the performance of our business in Colombia. Just to give you an idea of what a little margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3970.09-3975.96: Per ton in January and very low in excess of $30 per ton of erythra. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3977.28-3983.10: The reality is that once they start picking up, they are very confident that they profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3983.18-3988.13: We feel our presence in Colombia will continue improving in a significant way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3988.63-3995.20: To answer your question about the US market, I would like to take the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4000.00-4003.92: Thank you and good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4004.66-4012.61: I feel like we are very well positioned to take on more of that opportunity as it presents itself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4012.91-4016.02: We think it's going to be much bigger going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4016.62-4024.98: The reality is, as of now in Q1-19, we had about 5% that represented about 5% of our volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4025.11-4029.77: And in Q1 2020, it's representing about 8% of all voters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4030.03-4039.54: So, you know, we have been focusing on that. So, we feel like we're in a pretty good situation and we do see some increased demand there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4039.56-4040.70: To be able to take it back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4046.15-4048.35: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4049.25-4050.67: So, in the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4050.71-4062.00: And you don't see any differences in demand from COVID-19 from densely populated regions compared to others that are not as densely populated regions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4071.17-4073.85: I don't think that we are seeing any... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4074.49-4078.44: In demand from large metropolitan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4078.46-4085.85: In the Pacific Occupied Regions, these are the more developed areas in the U.S., right? Yes, that's correct. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4091.75-4099.40: I think there will be a difference. One, I think we're monitoring that as we go because the local and state governments, they kind of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4100.00-4107.77: Make some of their own decisions and where we have revenues and tolls and we have... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4107.79-4117.78: You know, things that help fund the highway, the gas tax and things like that. Wherever there's differences there, there could be differences in demand as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4117.88-4119.56: We keep an eye on that by state. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4122.36-4127.23: Thank you so much. Take care. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4129.77-4134.13: Our next question is from Mike Beck with database analysis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4136.62-4145.55: Thank you very much. My question is on energy costs please. They were down I think in Colombia 8.8% in Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4146.01-4150.21: What is the outlook for energy costs in Columbia, please, for the rest of the year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4151.29-4159.06: Secondly, in the US, were there any savings in energy or diesel costs of significance in Q1? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4159.08-4161.42: What's the outlook for the rest of the year if you could. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4161.72-4164.86: And then finally on your reset initiative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4165.19-4173.87: Does it include the benefit of lower energy costs expected this year or would they be on top of the Reset Initiative cost savings? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4179.00-4181.48: Might be a reality set in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4181.92-4186.33: Energy prices have decreased in a significant way from last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4186.43-4192.57: So the remaining of the year we are seeing them on the same level as we have the first quarter of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4193.33-4200.98: In the US we have seen significant savings in research for our very next flip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4202.78-4209.09: Significant, very good performance because of the lower prices of oil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4209.81-4217.12: In general, we are focusing on a much better scenario in terms of energy prices in the low-power regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4217.76-4225.39: The middle of the Central America and the Caribbean where all of the countries around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4225.95-4227.53: So you can argue here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4227.55-4232.05: In terms of energy cost, there will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4232.07-4238.04: Very favorable going forward in all of the three regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4238.60-4246.03: With Tomás Camilo, a little bit more on the specifics of each region and more than what. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4246.81-4250.35: One, for my part, this is for my retreat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4251.73-4259.52: I would just like to add that the impact of this energy cost reduction and our variable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4259.70-4264.66: Are very significant. As of today, our valuable costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4264.68-4272.51: Per ton including plants, as a fission of Calcahena and others filling wet process as Jumbo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4272.85-4277.36: So our average viable cost in Colombia is $20. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4278.12-4283.12: And it goes very, very much lower, you know, just like Catarina, for example. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4283.54-4289.45: So that is a great effect of these prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4289.57-4298.28: In Colombia we are using mostly coal today as gas is nominated in dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4298.48-4305.57: But there is a very good availability of code at this moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4305.63-4309.55: And our strategy to diversify. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4310.09-4314.15: Are a few materials with alternative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4314.17-4324.24: Fuels, it also came back as we are using cheap tires and biomass and other different types of fuels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4324.32-4326.29: Good opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4326.31-4335.58: To start using urban residues converting into fuels for the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4336.08-4340.90: So we are seeing a good outlook in terms of peers for this year in collaboration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4340.92-4345.09: Problem. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4347.97-4352.67: I can compliment on Honduras and Puerto Rico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4353.53-4358.52: We have, of course, implemented the solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4358.54-4363.94: Generation field in Enduros which has a significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4364.36-4373.05: Lower cost or lower price of energy to the local energy that's available. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4373.29-4375.08: For the bill received significant savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4375.92-4385.73: We also installed or put in operation a solid fuel storage in the northern part of the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4386.31-4392.33: We were, before we were buying FedCope from a local supplier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4392.71-4394.95: And now we're able to bring in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4394.98-4410.73: Ships of 30,000 to 40,000 tons, which gives it a very good hedge on negotiating prices. We're seeing prices reduced by 10 to 15 dollars per ton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4410.77-4414.63: That's going to have also a point of impacting the cost of the operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4415.24-4424.68: And in Puerto Rico we had negotiated a call last year which was much better than the crisis that we had before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4424.72-4434.75: But we expect to have, of course, better pricing due to the fuels or the commodity prices decline in the future for the operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4434.95-4439.82: And we're also looking at implementing our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4439.94-4447.49: Looking at different solutions for energy in countries which we still have high cost such as India and Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4449.01-4455.86: Countries such as Panama and the Dominican Republic, we have very competitive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4455.88-4459.40: Contracts negotiated with local energy suppliers. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4461.40-4464.16: You come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4464.22-4473.49: I just wanted to compliment what you said for the US standpoint with respect to diesel. I mean, we have seen some movement at the pump, especially in our rating business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4474.09-4480.48: Again, I think you're correct. I feel like we're going to see more of that as the year goes on just because of what's happening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4481.62-4483.26: Situation in the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4490.41-4499.90: Thank you for that. Can I just then follow up? Are those savings from all those fuel savings you've been talking about, are they in the reset numbers or are they on top of the reset numbers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4504.90-4507.41: Be on top of the rigid numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4509.51-4516.86: Are saving variable cost and we are basically addressing fixed cost and tactics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4520.00-4525.02: Much and stay safe. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4526.77-4530.79: And our last question is from Juan Mejia with Ashmore. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4532.81-4542.42: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Could you provide us with an overview for the working capital requirements of the business? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4543.14-4551.61: We saw an increase in inventories and receivables. So can you tell us how these accounts are behaving? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4555.54-4556.94: Thank you for your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4558.70-4561.50: Some sort of a capital management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4562.64-4564.98: I have one rather wobbly comb. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4565.33-4568.47: The working capital, the behavior of the working capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4568.49-4576.38: So far from the beginning of this crisis has been very good. We are controlling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4576.40-4579.24: Almost a deep level of the organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4579.44-4582.16: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4582.88-4588.71: Almost every one of the approvals of the purchase orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4590.97-4595.06: I think that makes it harder in that situation like this one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4597.04-4602.18: Just to give you a little more context. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4603.00-4605.67: In the case of the Columbia and the Thomas, it's doing very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4606.39-4613.81: We stopped the operations in the last 10 days of March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4613.83-4619.26: We have collected about 90 million pesos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4619.32-4625.11: More than 90 billion pesos during April, not selling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4625.29-4629.33: But we are collecting the receivables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4629.97-4639.08: And we are at work to implement a plan in order to reduce the level of the inventory in all of the three regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4639.16-4641.40: And that is growing the world of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4643.16-4651.41: For that reason the idea is to have a ruler that has extreme control in all of the three lines of the working capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4652.07-4660.82: And we consider that we have the, we are expected to have very good plans in all of this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4669.79-4672.37: Thank you and I'm not showing any further questions from the Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4678.54-4679.86: Once again, thanks a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4679.94-4688.55: For connecting to our conference call today. Please stay safe. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in our next conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4688.73-4689.85: How about the rest of you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4692.11-4698.56: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our program for today. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day. 
asr:0: END
