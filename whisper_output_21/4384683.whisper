asr:0: OUTPUT 84.70-98.30: Yesterday we announced that we updated our 2020 financial guidance with net income and earnings per diluted share expected to be near the upper end of the ranges, which are $186 to $198 million for net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 98.32-102.64: And $3.44 to $3.68 for earnings per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 103.42-109.15: Our guidance for capital expenditures and asset removal costs remains $500 to $525 million for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 110.31-111.99: Turning to our actual results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 112.01-123.02: Net income for the third quarter was $21.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared with $17.5 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the same period 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 124.50-130.39: Our third quarter results reflect an increase in net margin of $5.2 million over the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 130.41-138.30: Which is primarily due to $3.7 million from new rates and $2.7 million in residential sales from net residential customer growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 139.76-145.39: Operating costs for the third quarter were $0.8 million higher compared to the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 146.03-155.34: This includes an increase of $1.8 million in expenses related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $1.5 million increase in employee-related costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 156.24-164.72: Offsetting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 166.03-175.70: We have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer for regulatory purposes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 175.72-179.80: Certain net increases in expenses and lost revenues due to COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 180.72-188.47: We continue to evaluate whether amounts expected to be recoverable under these accounting orders are both measurable and probable of recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 188.75-192.53: And will record such amounts for financial accounting purposes when we meet that hurdle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 193.43-198.52: Our guidance for 2020 does not assume that we will record any regulatory assets by the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 199.76-205.39: Our capital expenditures and asset removal costs decreased this quarter compared with the third quarter last year simply due to timing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 206.67-215.26: Yesterday, the OneGas Board of Directors declared a dividend of 54 cents per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 216.70-224.46: The authorized rate base, reflecting our recent regulatory activity, is approximately $3.71 billion as of September 30. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 225.29-233.05: Authorized rate base is defined as the rate base reflected in completed regulatory proceedings, including full rate cases and interim rate filings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 234.25-237.60: We project that for 2020, our estimated average rate days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 237.62-247.11: Which is defined as authorized rate base plus additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that are not yet reflected in approved regulatory filing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 247.21-249.57: Will be approximately 3.91 billion dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 250.03-254.67: With 42% of that in Oklahoma, 29% in Kansas, and 29% in Texas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 256.24-263.08: We ended the quarter with adequate liquidity, which includes approximately $391 million of capacity in our commercial paper program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 263.10-268.11: And all of the capacity under our $250 million, 364-day credit facility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 268.87-278.86: Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, we've issued approximately $13 million of equity under the $250 million at-the-market equity program we put in place earlier this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 279.48-285.95: We have no plans to issue equity for the remainder of 2020. Now, I'll turn it over to Curtis for our regulatory and commercial update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.61-295.80: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll provide an overview of recent regulatory activity and then provide an update on our commercial activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 297.30-299.68: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 299.70-307.37: Reliability Surcharge, or GSRS, that seeks an increase in rates of approximately $7.5 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 307.39-312.29: Will capital expenditures incurred during the period covering July? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 312.71-315.18: 2019 through June 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 316.30-322.32: An order from the KCC is expected in December 2020 with new rates going into effect in January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 323.98-332.53: Texas Gas Service filed a rate case in December 2019 for all customers in the Central Texas and Gulf Coast service areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 332.55-337.08: Seeking a rate increase and requesting to consolidate the two services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 338.54-344.04: In August, the Railroad Commission approved all terms of a $10.3 million settlement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 345.27-353.77: As well as consolidation of the Central Texas Service Area and the Gulf Coast Service Area into a new Central Gulf Service Area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 355.44-364.50: This is a continuation of our strategy to consolidate jurisdictions, which is a benefit to customers due primarily to a more efficient process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 365.93-375.38: With this latest consolidation, we now have five jurisdictions in Texas, down from 10 at the time of spinoff in 2014. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 377.48-379.72: Moving on to our commercial activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 382.82-385.15: During our second quarter analyst call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 385.19-394.65: I discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large transport customers that had temporarily curtailed operations at the start of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 395.50-400.10: And that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 401.38-408.43: For the third quarter 2020, our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 409.07-411.99: And on a year-to-date comparison between years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 412.01-419.56: Our transport revenues have erased the second quarter 2020 impact and are now flat year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 421.60-425.99: We continue to see strong interest in natural gas from builders and developers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 426.69-438.28: Capital spending to extend our service to reach new customers is the primary driver behind our increased capital expenditures guidance for 2020 as we described last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 439.54-446.87: Despite the pandemic, we're seeing positive economic signs across our footprint, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 447.09-456.98: As an example, in the Austin area, there have been over 100 new business relocations or expansions announced thus far in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 457.00-461.14: Which are expected to provide over 14,000 additional new jobs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 462.74-469.29: This increase in economic activity across our territories has resulted in continued growth in our customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 470.53-476.72: Year to date, we have averaged approximately 24,000 more sales customers than the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 477.86-483.02: This increase includes the connection of 18,600 new customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 483.04-493.03: Compared with 14,600 new customers in the same period last year, or a 27% increase over last year's pace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 494.45-497.86: As I described during our last two quarterly analyst calls. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 497.94-505.37: The impact of the moratorium on disconnects for nonpayment by our customers, which expired in May,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 505.39-513.03: In Oklahoma and Kansas, and early October in some areas of Texas, has also impacted our average customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 514.19-517.04: And now I'll turn it over to Sid for an update on operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 518.26-527.25: Thanks, Curtis. Our team in the field continues to adapt well to the current environment with maintenance and compliance work on or ahead of schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 528.09-530.43: Our supply chain remains uninterrupted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 530.77-540.44: And we see no forward constraints to our planned work, thanks to steady performance by our resource management team related to materials and contractor resources. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 541.32-549.23: As Karen mentioned, while our capital spend was lower this quarter than the third quarter of last year, the issue is timing rather than performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 549.69-557.12: We've been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year to date, with more consistent capital spend quarter to quarter than last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 557.58-564.36: Due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management, engineering and field operations teams. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 565.04-571.63: We remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance as discussed earlier. And now I'll turn it over to Pierce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.97-580.36: Thank you, Karen, Curtis, and Sid. The pandemic has changed many things for many people. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.20-584.70: Our homes have become the place where we spend more and more time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.55-592.37: Our customers take comfort in the warmth that our product provides, especially as we head into colder weather. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.17-598.68: As we near the end of the year, it's natural to reflect on how far we've come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 599.44-606.49: For me, three things stand out, our resiliency, adaptability, and commitment to safety. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 607.31-611.75: Our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 611.77-617.68: And the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.66-628.45: This year, we were able to grow our customer base, improve system integrity, and establish a remote workforce amidst great adversity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 629.29-635.32: Despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our industry is accustomed to frontline response. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.02-640.86: Across our organization, we quickly implemented additional safety protocols. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.88-646.61: And new processes designed to keep our employees and our customers safe during the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 647.71-656.18: Thanks to the adaptability and diligence of each employee, we've continued providing service to our customers with minimal disruptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 657.54-667.31: Finally, in closing, I'd like to recognize the One Gas employees and give each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 667.33-672.61: Resolve when there's no clear end in sight, and poise in the face of uncertainty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 673.69-679.10: We'll get through this pandemic by relying on the values that we anchor our company to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.00-689.35: As we address the challenges that face our business. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Operator, we're now ready for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 691.09-696.94: Alright, if you would like to ask a question, you may signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 697.32-702.80: If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 703.28-709.71: Again, that is star 1 to ask a question. And we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 719.76-723.98: All right, and the first question is from Richard Cicirelli with Bank of America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 726.61-728.03: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me okay? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 730.07-734.35: Good morning, Richard. Hey, thanks for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.32-742.48: I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about COVID and the peak winter heating season here. And I realize. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 743.08-747.35: OGS has a higher proportion of residential versus C&I transport customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 747.83-753.87: But how are you thinking about factoring the lingering impact, especially with the resurgence of cases? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.31-758.88: As you begin to look at your 2021 outlook and the moving pieces. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 759.38-764.06: And maybe just also comment on the equity needs into next year as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 766.61-774.93: Richard, it said let me start and throw to Curtis for the commercial part of that question and then Karen can come in on the end in terms of the financing question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 775.92-779.64: We have been preparing for winter since March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 780.00-785.87: We understood that there was a high probability that we would see a second wave. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 786.27-790.33: And that we would see some commingling of COVID and the flu. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 790.85-794.15: So our medical protocols were built with that in mind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 794.79-798.40: We have not seen constraints in our service territories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 798.56-805.27: And our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 805.29-811.85: To make sure that we can provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their families and our customers safe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 811.87-820.48: But also to allow us to tamp down any widespread unavailability of employees in any of our service territories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 820.84-822.66: So we feel like we're well prepared. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.34-832.99: We don't say that spiking the ball on the 50. We recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us, but we think we're as well prepared as we can be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.13-835.90: So let me toss to Curtis to respond to the commercial question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 836.74-844.80: Mr. Richard, on the commercial side of things, as you know, we have a very high percent of our customer base being residential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 845.19-849.23: And then about 12% that's our transport customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 849.81-859.02: One of the things that I noted in my comment is that we're really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers, so we seem to have returned to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 859.04-865.21: Normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap with the activity we saw in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.23-870.39: Closing the gap from what we saw during the second quarter of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.41-878.54: On the residential side of things, I think we're well prepared in our customer call centers to handle the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 878.56-882.12: The call volume that we typically run into this time of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.28-886.99: One of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 887.01-907.23: At the end of May for Oklahoma and Kansas and a little bit later in Texas is that while those moratoriums were in place, SID's operations teams were able to divert those resources to handle a lot of our other normal annual activities and to get some of those things, get ahead of those activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 907.25-918.74: Such that when the moratoriums were lifted, we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process, which helped with our collection through that period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 919.72-934.61: Several factors that we had to remain agile to handle during the year, but cooperation and the work between our commercial and operations teams helped us work through that part of it to be ready when we could, again, resume disconnect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 934.63-936.36: And that's helped our overall process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 937.16-945.71: The last piece I would say is, as Karen talked about, we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 945.77-954.41: We will continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses as well as areas where we have been able to decrease expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.47-962.24: So that and continue to accumulate those until we're able to go through the regulatory process to begin recovery on those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 964.46-973.97: I'll pick up on the financing question. We have not updated our longer-term guidance for financing, which currently is that we anticipate $850 to $900 million of net financing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 975.32-977.88: Worth with about a quarter of that being equity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 978.48-986.59: When we issue our guidance for 2021, which we expect to do probably sometime after the first of the year, we'll provide a closer look on what 2021 looks like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 988.77-992.29: Okay, got it. That's very helpful. Appreciate all the color there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 992.75-997.96: And maybe just switching gears here, obviously, with elections on top of mind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 998.38-1002.76: Just curious how you're thinking about decarbonization goals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1003.20-1010.57: And just given really some of the potential for electrification and buildings and some of the supply and cost constraints on the R&D side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1011.53-1017.22: Is that really the solution or is green hydrogen potentially a more likely candidate? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1017.62-1024.98: Just maybe curious if you can provide some thoughts overall on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.61-1037.84: Another good question, Richard. This is Curtis again. So on the commercial side, I've talked before about efforts we've had around renewable natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1038.08-1047.47: There are several different projects and developers that we're talking to. Some already capture RNG and use it for alternative uses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1047.69-1059.24: What we may be able to bring to the table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that captured gas by bringing it into our system and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1059.26-1062.44: Getting it tracked through to be used as. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1062.46-1067.13: Replacement for diesel or other products through compressed natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.29-1075.96: And so we're continuing to explore and hopefully we'll be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1076.92-1085.97: We've proven the commercial ability of those projects and we've established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.99-1088.19: That product into our systems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1088.33-1090.51: And we continue to make progress on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.47-1099.24: We're also in an H2 at scale project with the University of Texas and some other parties, including the DOE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1100.00-1109.87: To run some different scale projects of converting or producing hydrogen both from renewable power as well as from landfill gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.93-1118.48: And then using that hydrogen that's produced to run a computer center at the University of Texas as well as. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1118.50-1122.10: As provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell beacon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1122.56-1128.21: So we're continuing to do that project just started earlier in the mid part actually of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1128.79-1131.09: So it's about a three-year project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1132.25-1133.95: Promising results come out of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1134.63-1140.92: But I'm going to turn it to Sid and he can talk a little bit more about what we're doing and what we're seeing on the operations side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1144.10-1153.41: Richard, thank you for the question. As you know, there is a commercial component to this, an R&D component, as you point out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1153.47-1162.92: But there are also some practical implications that companies need to consider as emergent opportunities like hydrogen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.24-1164.30: Start to be developed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1164.64-1166.89: We have two working groups in place currently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1167.49-1176.52: One is looking at technical issues, including the engineering implications. There will be policies and procedures around hydrogen use. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.10-1181.66: And there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.01-1196.48: The second is a really interesting working group that's looking at the gas supply implications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1196.98-1201.38: Hydrogen is a different material to compress and transport. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1201.70-1209.59: And so the location of manufacturing facilities comes into play. We're scoping all of that right now and excited about continuing the conversation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.13-1216.50: All right, thanks very much for all the color there. That's all I have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.64-1229.61: Alright, once again that is star 1 to ask a question. If you find your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star 2.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1267.85-1272.75: We're not out of the COVID impact, certainly by a long stretch. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.17-1282.78: We currently are $8.8 million of bad debt expense through the nine months. That compares to $4.6 million last year, so we're up about $4 million year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1283.94-1289.13: And again, we just work to monitor the situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1289.15-1298.14: There are still moratoriums in place in some of the service areas, and so until we get completely back to normal collections activities for an extended period of time,.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1304.02-1313.37: And how the change in Kansas related to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact one guy's cash flow going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.86-1324.02: It's not expected to have a material impact in the scheme of things. It's not a large in our overall tax picture. The elimination of the state income tax is not a large event.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1347.13-1356.66: Dr. Curtis. RNG is actually contemplated in the tariffs in Texas. It is a recoverable gas cost there.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1387.17-1403.94: But outside of that, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has opened up a notice of inquiry, looking at several different energy questions, one of which is renewable natural gas and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.28-1409.93: There are efforts underway at the state levels also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1410.05-1417.38: Not as much at this point in Kansas, but the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard.
