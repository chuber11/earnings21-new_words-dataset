asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.33-1816.18: The dividend will be paid on November 27th to shareholders of record on November 20th. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1816.94-1820.12: Let me now turn the call back over to David for concluding remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.18-1829.61: Thank you, Michael. We remain focused on efficiently operating our portfolio throughout the pandemic. With the safety of our tenants and employees our highest priority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.15-1836.88: We continue to take the necessary steps to navigate through the current challenges, whether it's by strong balance sheets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.90-1841.48: New York City has survived and thrived through challenging circumstances over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1841.82-1845.23: And we have every confidence that the city will emerge from the pandemic as strong as. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1846.91-1855.10: I look forward to capitalizing on a myriad of growth opportunities, including the 10-time Pacific Street redevelopment and the potential expansion of Flappage Gardens. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.78-1860.00: We hope everyone stays safe and healthy. With that, I would like to open up the line for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1862.10-1870.43: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is open for questions. If you have any questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star 1 on your touchtone phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.93-1879.96: Pressing star two will remove you from the queue should your question be answered. And lastly, while posing your question, please pick up your handset if listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.46-1888.43: Please hold while we poll for questions. And your first question is coming from Craig Kucera. Craig, your line's live. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.35-1892.57: Yeah, hi, I just wanted to confirm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1893.11-1901.52: Did you say that outside of Tribeca, where you gave the update that occupancy had improved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.58-1910.17: You mentioned Flatbush. All the other properties have seen anywhere from a 380 to 610 basis point in occupancy since the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1912.93-1914.15: Yeah, hi Craig, how are you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1915.24-1924.60: When at the end of the second quarter, some of the properties, as we said, Aspen, 10 West at Clover House, they were all in the mid 90s percent occupancy range, 95 to 97%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.27-1928.65: By the end of the third quarter, they had dipped a bit to 90%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.21-1933.31: But since the end of the third quarter between September and today,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.41-1938.04: We see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from 3 to 4 to 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.06-1944.66: The Aspen, San Juan, and Cloverhouse properties currently are leased ranging from 92 to 95 percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.97-1951.61: Okay, great. And I just wanted to follow up on... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1952.51-1959.66: Have rents trended flat in the fourth quarter, or have there been any rent concessions to get those folks back? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1962.76-1963.82: Hey, do you want to talk to that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1966.41-1972.81: The rents have pretty much stayed a drop below what they were prior. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.01-1981.14: Simply because we're trying to recapture occupancy so that we're positioned for when the market does come back to start pushing rents again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1981.22-1987.19: For now, we're doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1987.81-1991.73: So there's a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.67-1996.14: Got it. And just one more for me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1996.64-1999.56: You know, are you tracking or able to track whether. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1999.58-2008.77: As the folks moved out from second to third quarter, are they staying in market or are these people basically just exiting the markets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.21-2012.71: Maybe they'll come back at some point in the future, but are no longer in the greater New York MSA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.38-2023.42: To answer that without exact numbers, the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of the city. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2023.84-2028.57: Some of them, depending on the property, are moving to, let's say, second homes that they have in the suburbs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2029.89-2036.86: Many of them tell us when on the way out, they say, you know, we wish this didn't come to this. We hope to be back soon. We really like the property. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2036.94-2040.84: And we're looking forward for when things get back to normal so we can return to the city. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2043.00-2045.69: Okay, well that's encouraging. That's it for me, thanks guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2050.03-2054.35: If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2061.56-2066.93: Okay, your next question is coming from Buck Horn. Buck, your line's live. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2068.23-2075.82: Hey, thanks. Hey, Mike, could you just quantify what the bad debt expense was in the quarter? I don't know. Did you break that up? The operating expenses? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2076.62-2079.90: Absolutely, as a refresher in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2080.34-2086.49: As you know, we took about a $600,000 bad debt expense and now into the third quarter here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2086.81-2091.53: Again, given the high collection rate, as JJ said, we're still in the high 90s. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2092.55-2097.48: So what we've seen is actually to date pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.36-2107.01: All in all, at the third quarter, we took a proximate $660,000 charge for bad debt. So about a 10% increase over the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.41-2115.42: But again, given everything that's been going on with the pandemic, I think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see collections hold up overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2121.60-2126.07: If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.21-2134.81: We have no remaining questions in queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2136.20-2140.78: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Stay safe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.20-2151.45: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation. 
asr:0: END
