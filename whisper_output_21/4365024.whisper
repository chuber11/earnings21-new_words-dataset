asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.16-1327.59: Non-operating cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal settlements in Q3 will be approximately $83 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1328.71-1335.72: Third quarter capex should come in at approximately $40 million and we're still expecting approximately $160 million for the entire year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.55-1356.22: In the current environment, meaning the timing of certain tab X can be delayed until later quarters if required. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1356.88-1369.71: Finally, we expect Nexstar's cash interest expense to approximately $78 million for the third quarter and $325 to $350 million for the full year, reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in LIBOR rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.39-1383.42: Turning to the balance sheet, Nexstar's outstanding debt at June 30 was approximately $8 billion and consisted of $5.4 billion of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.61-1430.13: As a reminder, our First Link Covenant limits cash netting to approximately $200 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1431.23-1436.76: Our total net leverage at quarter end was 4.47 compared to 5.18 at year end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.16-1444.36: As a reminder, Nextar's only covenant is our first lien debt covenant, which is the aforementioned four and a quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1445.91-1455.24: At the onset of the pandemic, Nexstar took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment and to preserve liquidity in order to best position the company for long-term success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1455.26-1457.52: As we return to normalized operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1457.88-1461.26: In this regard, we continue to prioritize cash retention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1461.28-1469.73: And I have to add approximately $231 million to our first quarter cash position for a total cash balance of $665 million at June 30th.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1474.47-1484.90: At the same time, during the second quarter, we returned approximately $25 million to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made $13 million in payments on our debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.31-1495.64: During the first half of 2020, we have accurately managed our capital structure, cost of capital, and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.66-1498.02: While enhancing shareholder returns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.48-1507.85: Year to date we have allocated approximately $594 million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including $473 million in debt reduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1507.87-1513.03: $51 million in dividend payments and $73 million in share repurchase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.51-1521.56: In the near time, while preliminary data suggests ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.58-1527.55: We continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as we move through the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1528.25-1537.90: Looking ahead, with continued double-digit year-over-year growth in distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.94-1541.76: Which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1542.14-1546.29: We have excellent visibility on over 50% of our annual revenue in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.75-1551.17: As such, we expect to brief free crash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1551.41-1567.41: In addition to continuing our dividend payments, we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage deduction and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of home net leverage to four times by year-end 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.89-1575.84: Nexstar has already made significant progress in our leverage reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity under our revolver. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.24-1581.60: In addition, the reduction in interest rate expense related to favorable LIBOR rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.62-1588.93: Operating expense savings and our capital allocation prioritization will also serve us well in the second half of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.45-1599.06: As a result, we're confident in our liquidity position and ability to service our debt through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.28-1609.93: In summary, despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic, our scale, leadership, flexibility, synergy realization, and operation plans are generating results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1610.39-1616.14: Our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital, maturity, and ability to quickly address leverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1616.48-1622.46: In addition, our service to our local communities and local and national advertisers has never been stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.00-1629.17: Our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency and visibility to our results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.45-1635.62: And we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1636.14-1642.74: That concludes the financial review for the call. I'll now turn it over back to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1644.30-1645.49: Thanks very much, Tom. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1645.93-1655.34: In summary, I hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience of Nextar's scaled and diversified business model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1655.98-1664.72: Nextar's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment due to several factors, including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.74-1671.15: The continued growth of our distribution revenue stream, and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1672.11-1679.14: In terms of capital allocation, we believe that our free cash flow combined with the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.16-1684.76: Will provide us with financial flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.41-1695.18: As a result, NXSTAR is well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.20-1701.26: In building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs, and optimizing the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1701.90-1708.15: This focus combined with our time-proven operating strategies is enabling Nexgar to overcome the near-term challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1708.17-1711.95: And extend our long-term record of growth and shareholder value creation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1713.09-1717.92: We look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after Election Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.94-1725.65: And on behalf of the entire NextStar Nation, our board and our management team, thank you for your continued interest, support, and for joining us today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1726.37-1731.25: So now let's open the call to Q&A to address your specific areas of interest. Operator? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.00-1744.62: If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1745.45-1753.65: Again, that is star 1 if you would like to ask a question. And we'll take our first question from John Janides with Wolf Research. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1756.52-1759.90: I have two for you. One is you talked about local news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1759.92-1768.73: Viewership. What are you seeing in terms of advertiser-demanded growth in news relative to the day parts given the ratings you spoke to in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1768.87-1778.20: And I guess the sub-levels of alignment expectations, is the reintro that there's been no noticeable impact from the pandemic or is that just due to the call given the lack? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.44-1790.89: Well, as it relates to local news, you know, through the first six months of this year, 51% of our total advertising revenue came from local news, and that's up over the prior years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1790.91-1793.59: Cumulative totals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1793.63-1801.80: Which indicates obviously advertisers are putting their money into that product with increasing frequency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1802.84-1808.59: Obviously, the demand is where the audience is, and that's where the audience is for us right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.57-1812.55: And so we do see continued read through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1812.57-1822.62: And we're hopeful that the audience gains, at least some of them will be sticky when, you know, and I hate to use this term, when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is. But so far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.64-1829.35: Through this normal, people in all age groups are tuning to our local news broadcasts in increasing numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.93-1836.44: I will say that, I mean, obviously, MBPDs have reported sub-counts in attrition for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.46-1842.54: You know, those are factored into our projections and analyses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.58-1849.29: And our retrans revenue is, again, we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.35-1855.48: And we are at budget on retrends revenue and our projections through the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.52-1860.36: We have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.38-1866.45: We think it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.27-1872.83: Will come from Stephen Cole with Wells Fargo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1874.59-1884.88: Thanks. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your reverse compensation agreements. As subject clients are accelerating, I was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1885.19-1894.81: And also, does it make you think about moving from like a per sub basis, sorry, to a per sub basis from a fixed programming fee where you can? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.06-1903.12: And relatedly, we have more broadcast content going direct to consumer like CBS All Access and Peacock. So how do you think about monetizing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.14-1907.53: Those households that may not be subscribing through the traditional process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1909.05-1918.10: I would say the current relationships with the networks are a mix of fixed fee and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1918.12-1925.35: Percentages of distribution revenue. So there are some that are fungible and others that are not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.69-1931.05: And those conversations are continuing what's in the best interest of both parties to get a deal done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1931.39-1938.98: So there is some hedge there at this point and we're not ready to call the ball as to what the most preferable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.00-1942.86: Preferable term is there based on our negotiating ability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1943.64-1952.45: As it relates to CBS All Access, we participate in that. We're paid to be a part of that service, and our local stream is a part of that offering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1953.69-1954.81: Peacock we are not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1955.58-1965.09: Affiliate local news, affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast offering and we're not sure if at any point they will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1966.11-1979.18: But we do have this thing called over the air, which we reach a much larger universe potentially than the wired and pay cable universe already, where 16% of our viewers already. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1979.22-1989.71: Use that as their reception device without the aid of a paywall, and that's available to those who want to quote, stream us that way, if you will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.73-2000.94: And the good news about that is there are far fewer competitors for eyeballs in an over-the-air world than there are in a 500 plus cable or satellite universe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2001.90-2004.12: Again, we... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2004.14-2010.41: We are in flux. We have a lot of our agreements nailed down through 21 and 22. We do have some that will be up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2010.47-2016.30: End of this year and early next year, and that's where those conversations will center around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2016.42-2019.90: The best type of agreement for both companies to enter into. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.54-2029.61: Great. And then just one on political. Four years ago, we kind of got a head fake at the last minute from the Trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2030.25-2038.84: I don't think any of us expect that to happen this time, but when do you feel comfortable that there's not going to be any negative surprises on the political spending side? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2040.06-2041.90: I'm pretty comfortable in that right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.98-2051.05: I mean, look at the amount of money that both camps have raised, that the attendant PACs and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2051.07-2052.47: Down ballot candidates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.65-2059.16: There are no guarantees in this business, but as close to a guarantee as I'll make you is there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.38-2068.85: That's a pretty good guarantee. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2070.13-2079.42: Okay, great. Thanks for your question. The first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in July versus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2079.44-2084.38: Total 2Q20 or even the pro forma year-over-year change so far in July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2084.76-2089.57: And then more broadly and i think it's a little bit related to stephen's question you know the narrative out there has been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.59-2097.92: The macro environment and growth in streaming is going to accelerate the shift of ad dollars from linear TV to connected TV and streaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.16-2103.32: Can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative does turn out to play out? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2106.33-2107.61: I'll let you address the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.63-2110.13: How linear you want to get on guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2110.15-2118.34: Obviously we saw substantial sequential improvement in Corad trends in July versus not only June but the entire quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2119.62-2123.40: Tom, I don't know if you want to add any more details to that, but I'll let you speak to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2124.66-2132.79: Sure, well I think what I'll say about July is obviously July was substantially better than the second quarter as a whole. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.11-2142.66: In July was better than the last month of the second quarter. So, sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.41-2149.29: As it relates to additional streaming services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2149.65-2157.60: At some point there becomes kind of a sameness to them and, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2157.62-2163.68: It's all about the content. If you have the content that people want, they will find a way to consume you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.76-2169.43: Whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.89-2175.28: And without our services, you have an inferior offering to the viewing public. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2175.78-2184.28: It is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for. And so I think we'll just stand by that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2184.50-2191.63: It's a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.97-2198.02: Is it a fragmenting universe, but are they just taking from a wire, from a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2198.06-2205.79: A traditional pay TV universe into a virtual pay TV universe, and if so, and we're on both sides of that transaction,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2206.19-2213.19: It's not nearly the noise that it appears to be in the investment community. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2213.47-2221.38: We're somewhat sanguine about it. We have a product that people want. We're the largest producer of it in the country. It's called Local News. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.40-2226.69: And we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last 40 years test of time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2228.05-2229.25: Yeah, I think that makes sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2229.57-2230.81: One more if I could. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2231.23-2232.23: Does the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2232.25-2236.42: I guess for Tom, does the target leverage ratio for this year contemplate... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2236.44-2243.42: Any buybacks in the second half. And can you remind us of where we are in resuming the repurchase program? Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.45-2252.13: It does. I won't say how much of it is allocated to stock repurchases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.61-2260.12: The way we think, we have an authorization left from the board. We're currently not buying stock. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.50-2266.47: But I would anticipate that to get revisited here in the not too distant future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.91-2281.18: The way we think about it is really starting on Labor Day, and quite honestly, that's probably not doing service to the fact that, as Perry mentioned, July political revenue is very strong and we think August will be as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.20-2292.61: We're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story during the pandemic just about poor advertising revenue and what's happening there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2293.35-2301.90: The other two legs to the stool from our perspective, distribution revenue has been strong, continues to be strong as Perry mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.08-2305.81: We're on budget for the year, we're on budget for the second, we were on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2305.93-2308.25: We were actually above budget for the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.33-2312.43: We're on budget for the third quarter with regard to retransmission revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2312.83-2319.52: And then the third leg of the stool is political and that's really going, that candle is going to get lit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2320.00-2327.87: Here right around Labor Day and run really hard for the two months of September, October, and the first week of November. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2328.23-2339.38: So the free cash flow of the company will continue to go along nicely and then get turbocharged by free cash flow from political beginning around Labor Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2339.90-2345.51: As I've said to other people, I fully expect our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2345.53-2353.33: Capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around Labor Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2353.41-2360.28: We're not there yet, but I can see there from here, and when that happens, then I would imagine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2360.38-2365.45: We wouldn't sit here with an unnatural six hundred million dollars of cash on our balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.81-2375.80: We deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at stock repurchases, but that's a multivariable equation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.82-2379.46: Tell me what the stock is around that time and I'll tell you what our appetite is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2380.40-2383.74: Is that responsive, Zach? Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2385.73-2388.97: I just want to add to Tom's comment about political. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.37-2396.88: Most folks woke up this morning reading about Biden's buy that he's placing starting on September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2396.92-2404.90: First, in 15 states, we operate substantial operations in 12 of those 15 states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.92-2413.05: Just to point out that political will reach a crescendo around Labor Day that will continue on through the first week of November. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2413.45-2418.96: And again, with July results being above all of second quarter for political. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2419.00-2423.98: That's a pretty good measure, I think, of what's yet to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2424.20-2428.31: We remain confident in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2428.57-2437.98: Then I think you'll see Tom exercise more optionality around our cash forward that currently exists on the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2441.84-2445.35: We'll now take our next question from Erin Watts with Deutsche Bank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2447.81-2449.51: Guys, thanks for having me on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.57-2459.44: A couple questions on the ad environment. I guess first, there's been some fits and starts in terms of COVID cases in pockets of the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2459.76-2464.20: What behavior has been effective in your market that have been affected by that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2465.19-2470.41: And I guess on a related note, in terms of categories, just given the importance of the auto category. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2471.51-2478.64: Anything you can give us in terms of how that rebound is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2481.26-2487.87: Yeah, auto has rebounded, you know, we're seeing better pacing and better results in queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2487.93-2491.57: Three, then we did in Q2 when dealers were shut down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2492.53-2503.22: We're seeing certain of the OEMs move money around from market to market based on where they have cars, and that's primarily affected some of the foreign name plates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2503.24-2512.91: On the whole, I think our expectations for Otto are that it will be less down sequentially going forward, as will most of core advertising. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2514.17-2516.22: As it related to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.66-2525.55: I didn't know if you meant how it affected the company or what we're seeing in our markets. But I can give you a little color on both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.11-2534.81: We have had 145 confirmed cases in the company since the beginning of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2535.98-2542.34: Remarkably, out of a workforce of about 13,000 of people that are out in the community,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2542.90-2546.27: We've only had one hospitalization and that person is fully recovered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2547.69-2554.25: About 60% of our employees are working from the facility to which they are assigned. We have another. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.29-2563.90: 20% that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility, reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their first assignment and things of that sort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2564.34-2569.05: And we have another 20% that are working remotely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2569.11-2572.47: And I use the example with our board that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2572.69-2574.85: Everybody in Topeka is reporting to work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2575.18-2583.86: However, nobody is populating our New York offices because of the public transportation requirements and they don't feel safe and there's certainly no mandate to do that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.30-2590.63: And so that's kind of a proxy for the country. We keep tabs by every market as to... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2590.65-2598.04: You know, various stages of reopening. I would say that all of our markets have some degree of reopening, some more than others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2598.32-2603.64: There have been some pauses in California and Texas and others on further reopening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2604.28-2612.19: Areas have been rolled back, you know, bars and restaurants are not necessarily big advertising categories with us to begin with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2612.63-2620.00: Hospitality continues to be a category where we see no spend to speak of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2620.80-2627.95: There is some intrastate tourism ads that are going on, like if you're in Texas, come to Arkansas and vice versa, and Oklahoma. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2628.61-2637.56: We're seeing some of that, but hospitality for us is a sub-2% category that is not materially driving our top line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.38-2643.70: Aaron, I don't know if that's the kind of flavor you were looking for, but I'm happy to answer any more specific follow-up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2645.05-2650.35: One last one for me, and I appreciate the time again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2651.17-2657.62: You spoke to the importance of local news and the ad revenues that come in and attach to that to the overall revenue pie. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.88-2665.11: If we're thinking about the potential that maybe NFL football is delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2665.69-2671.71: How do we think about the flow through of that potential and what it could mean to your revenue pie? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2673.27-2679.22: Sure, I'm glad you asked that. It's interesting at the local station level, which is where we live. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2679.68-2684.44: All sports comprises about 10% of our advertising revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.01-2689.91: And of that, the NFL comprises about 60% of that 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2690.51-2698.32: So let's just in real round numbers say that ag revenue support is half of our revenue and NFL is 6% of our revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2698.34-2702.38: 10% of that, so we're talking about three points of revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2702.98-2710.81: So from an advertising perspective, because of the limited avail that the local stations get in all of local sports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.89-2713.45: Or all of televised sports that's not local. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2713.55-2715.24: You know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.30-2724.08: It's not that big of a contributor, but obviously it has an outsized effect on viewership, on promotional ability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2724.34-2727.57: I would say on the national psyche and on people's morale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2727.91-2733.83: Obviously, distributors are very interested in live sports because they know live sports and live news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.85-2742.74: Drive viewership, but from a pure financial advertising point of view, it's not all that material to our top or bottom line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2744.50-2747.55: Okay, perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. Stay well, guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.45-2754.51: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2756.60-2766.25: I had two questions. First, wondering if you could give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2766.31-2769.63: I'm curious how they compare to the overall industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2769.69-2775.88: And any color on advertising and distributor reception to News Nation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2775.90-2782.16: And any expectations for when you might see some incremental revenue lift from NewsNation. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2790.77-2799.70: I would say our experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2799.72-2824.72: The MVPDs. Obviously, we are still getting an uplift from the virtual MVPDs so that the traditional MVPD subscriber loss is somewhat recouped, but certainly not all recouped by the virtual MVPDs. And as Perry had mentioned, obviously we factor in in our budgeting process and in our guidance process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2824.74-2833.63: You know, an attrition rate for subscribers and a unit rate for our revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2833.77-2849.55: And as we mentioned, that was basically in line for the second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation. So not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2849.57-2859.50: I would say that we see and feel the same thing that the distributors do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2859.70-2863.82: It's just that our economics are a little bit different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2864.70-2871.77: Because we've got a rate that helps us offset that, but it's consistent with our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2873.91-2875.30: As it relates to WGN... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2875.38-2876.72: America we have had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2876.76-2880.30: And Dana Zimmer and her team have been out presenting WQED. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.36-2890.05: To every MBPD with which we already do business and also those that do not carry WGN. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2890.23-2893.65: In America and that's primarily in legacy Nexstar markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2894.87-2907.61: And we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately 200,000 to 250,000 subs that could add WGN America. Now, these are smaller systems, again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2907.63-2915.30: Where NECAR has a relationship but there was no Tribune relationship that would have included WG in America, so there is upside there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2915.60-2922.32: And I would say that the reception from distributors has been positive, particularly from those who have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.34-2929.55: Existing contracts and realize there's going to be additional value add for no additional cost during the term of the current agreement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2930.39-2933.93: We are distributed on AT&T now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2934.31-2939.86: As the only virtual MDPD service that is offering WGN America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2940.22-2949.19: We are efforting to get distribution at the launch or shortly thereafter on other OTT services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2949.25-2953.77: And that will be value add where WGN America is not currently distributed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2954.35-2960.74: The reception from both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we're investing in a product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2962.58-2966.35: As well. Great. Thanks, Greg. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2971.93-2973.83: From Dan Kretos with Benchmark. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2976.52-2977.54: Good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2978.00-2979.06: Here after the strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2979.26-2987.51: And all the questions, but I guess I'll ask you one follow-up to the prior, Perry. I don't know if you're willing to sort of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2987.53-3001.98: You know, good color on subcarriage incremental opportunity. Is there any way for us to think about sort of timing and higher thinking about the news nation impact itself relative to either advertising. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3002.00-3017.12: Or I guess, ancillary with that, your comment on CARES, we know it's going to be self-funding. Obviously, you have plans to kind of expand it. So, just any help kind of framing your thoughts on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3017.56-3026.73: And then separately, you know, obviously there's been a lot of noise lately in the digital world, Facebook, Twitter, Ad Boy products, all of that fun stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3027.33-3032.49: You guys are the largest, you guys have a pretty big network effect and a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3032.85-3037.78: Is there any accrued benefit to you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket? Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3040.02-3042.36: I'll speak first to WGN America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3042.64-3049.45: The, we have, I'm very impressed with the job that Dave Rodeman and his sales team have done in assembling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3049.47-3056.34: Advertisers for the premier week of WGN, America's news nation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.86-3061.60: Blue chip names and at cost per points that are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3061.66-3065.23: In excess of, I'm sorry, I should say cost per thousands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3065.25-3071.67: That are in excess of 50% greater than what standard programming was generating alone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3073.01-3079.64: So that's a very positive initial indication. We're trying to rework some of the existing buys into. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3079.68-3084.00: The News Nation primetime offering and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3084.40-3090.51: And so what we could really use is an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market to break. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3090.93-3096.60: But all of that said, we do anticipate an incremental, let's call it low,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3096.68-3105.91: Eight-figure revenue contribution to WGN's ad revenue in the four months of the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3107.31-3111.49: And again, given the size and scope of the operation, that wouldn't be deemed to be material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3111.59-3118.90: But we do, even in these conditions, expect a low eight-figure uplift in gross revenue there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3119.38-3126.57: And distribution, that will mostly come at the end of the year, so will impact 2021 more than this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3126.77-3134.65: There have been some incremental deals done already that will launch WGN America between now and the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3134.75-3139.12: But I would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3139.16-3145.23: In 2021. And again, you're talking a potential uplift of, you know, a quarter of a million subscribers on a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3145.25-3149.93: Nielsen reported I think 75 million subscriber base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3149.95-3156.48: Even that is incremental, but it's all incremental and that's what we're here to do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3160.68-3167.21: And then the thoughts on either Facebook, Twitter as it relates to core or political, if that stays in the digital bucket or if you can pick some of that up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3168.29-3177.90: Yeah listen i i think the most direct uh... Transfer could be in political people you know if certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3177.94-3183.36: You know, without conventions to fund and without rallies to fund,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3183.38-3188.37: The one way to reach people is through broadcast television. I think we're seeing evidence of that right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3188.77-3191.31: So I think that would be probably the direct transfer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3191.71-3193.63: You know, with all the boycatts and all of that, I... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3193.65-3202.16: I don't think you've seen a substantial decline in digital revenue performance on those platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3203.10-3215.66: So at this point, the damage is more reputational than financial, and we'll see how deep the government wants to get involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3215.68-3219.36: Companies more symmetrically with the way we're regulated, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.38-3226.49: At this point, I think the financial transfer outside of political, to the best of our knowledge, is minimal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3227.93-3234.13: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for the color and nice quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3234.93-3238.26: The next question will come from Craig Hubbard with Hubbard Resource Partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3240.32-3241.46: Yes, good morning. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3242.18-3252.15: A few questions. Last quarter on your conference call, I believe you guys said your re-trans subs were down 4, 4.5% year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3253.17-3259.94: As you guys may know, Sinclair on the call right before yours said the second quarter subs were down about 7%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3260.82-3270.13: Clean a bit benefit from the virtual side should I assume that you guys were down roughly about 7% for the second quarter for yourselves? Is that reasonable? Slightly worse in the first hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3271.73-3281.60: No. Should I assume it's a little bit better than that then? Or can you just help me understand? I would say it's more consistent with the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3283.62-3287.37: The second quarter, I'm sorry, you mean more consistent with the first quarter down 4, 4.5? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.57-3293.65: Oh, I'm sorry, with what we announced the first quarter. You're right, first quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3294.45-3299.62: But no, I wouldn't say it's down four. Craig, I'm not going to give the exact number. I've already said that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3300.04-3305.81: It's not down seven, but it's closer to the previous quarter's results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3308.43-3317.16: Okay, I appreciate that. Can you help us, your TV advertising pay scenes for the month of August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3317.56-3326.31: Would you say that those are tracking better, the rate of decline of your core advertising, that that is tracking better than what July turned out to be? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3329.73-3332.45: I think it's a little, we have very, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3332.49-3340.28: Few days in August here, I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3342.86-3344.68: Okay, can you help us and maybe just. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3344.70-3353.11: I'm trying to understand then what you're sort of budgeting or thinking that the rate of decline for your core advertising could be down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3353.13-3354.47: In the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3354.53-3355.82: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3356.62-3360.92: To maybe help us find it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3361.94-3366.51: It's going to be down. Tell us how much July was down, if you would. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3367.95-3372.51: I think I told you it was down less. Again, I'm not going to give specific numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3373.75-3378.24: But July was down less than June and June was obviously... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3378.50-3385.73: It's just math. If the entire quarter was down 35% and every month within the second quarter got better,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3386.13-3389.79: Then clearly June was down less than 35%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3390.93-3393.37: And July was down less than June. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3394.37-3402.44: That's kind of the extent of the forward-looking guidance that we're going to give as it relates to specific advertising revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3404.80-3413.27: Okay, maybe let me ask another question then. In this, on this virus situation that's going out there,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3414.25-3419.34: In the states where the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several weeks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3419.42-3425.61: Have you guys seen a material change in the core TV advertising in those markets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3425.75-3428.15: Is there any significant change that you can talk about? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3429.35-3433.33: No, and again, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3433.35-3436.06: Cases in Texas have gone down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3436.22-3449.05: But you have to, we don't operate just in one area that you're in that you might be hearing that news from, right? So you've got to look across 114 markets and look at, you know, those states and, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3449.09-3457.72: So, I think that's a good point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3457.74-3464.52: No, the evidence is in our results in July and our pacing in August and our pacing in September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3464.90-3470.71: All substantially better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed in second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3470.73-3480.46: The proof is in the numbers, as Tom says, it's just math. But we have not seen any, and I think I just said this, hospitality continues to be down, auto is improving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3480.68-3485.51: We don't get a lot of money from restaurants unless it's QSR and they're making mints through their drive-through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3485.81-3492.81: So, you know, things are, we are seeing steady improvements and even we're,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3493.63-3501.92: You know, pausing an opening is better than not being open at all, and that's kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets, and in others, we don't have that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3502.44-3509.03: This morning we're dealing with the aftermath of storms up the East Coast from the Carolinas into Virginia and up into... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3509.05-3512.95: Pennsylvania, New York, and flooding and those kinds of things, and those are going to be more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3512.97-3523.40: You know, temporary disruptors to businesses until they can reopen than the pandemic. And so it's situational and we deal in 38 states across the country and you've got to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3523.42-3526.31: And add it all together, but there's, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3526.35-3531.59: Nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things, and I think the results speak for themselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3533.03-3538.98: My last question guys on the cost front you guys talk about pro forma cost in the second quarter down 18%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3539.60-3549.13: Can you give us a little bit more to how we think about your costs trends for the third quarter? I know you gave a figure there versus your budget for the third quarter here to summer one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3549.15-3550.49: For the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.53-3557.24: What sort of costs, if you could all just help us a little bit think about that, that may not repeat the cost savings in the third quarter you benefit from? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3557.26-3558.66: In a second. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3560.84-3582.96: I really don't understand the question other than the fact that obviously we had guided to $40 million in cost takeouts in the second quarter, which we believe, you know, which we overperformed on. That same number for the third quarter is $25 million as we, obviously some of those are variable costs. As advertising starts to return, those costs go up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3583.78-3587.15: Some of them are discretionary that we will add back in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3587.73-3595.14: We will travel more in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. We basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second quarter than we did. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3595.38-3598.38: So some of the discretionary costs will get added back in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3599.12-3605.79: But that will be more than offset by higher advertising revenues in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3605.93-3608.99: But specifically as it relates to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3609.17-3617.50: If you're looking year over year, the majority of the synergies taken out of the Tribune transaction have occurred. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3617.96-3626.73: So that won't change materially sequentially Q2, Q3 over Q2 and you'll have some added expense coming back in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3627.03-3632.21: But that's the extent of some of the pushes and the pulls on expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3633.57-3635.84: You answered it well. Thank you. Appreciate that, guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3640.00-3643.54: We'll take our next question from John Cornwright with JK Media. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3644.74-3649.05: I hope you can hear me having internet problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3649.83-3657.72: Two quickies, Tom, I think the 24 bonds were callable two days ago and I heard nothing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3658.48-3660.28: That is being not likely to be called. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3662.40-3669.89: Well again, John, I think that's consistent with our message that in the next 30 to 45 days,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3669.93-3673.51: I think we will have a better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3673.61-3681.62: On actual political revenue coming in Labor Day and obviously same with another month of CORE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3681.78-3688.63: And we'll be able to start making more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3688.69-3698.00: In the last 120 days and probably the next 30 days, we're still going to continue to take a pretty conservative approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3698.04-3702.02: View on that, but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3702.04-3705.55: A little bit more aggressive in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3706.97-3716.90: Secondly, did I hear correctly that you're on track for a mid-teens net retrans growth this year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3717.14-3725.13: And you mentioned that the growth retrans is up high 20s pro forma. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3726.33-3731.11: Did I have it correctly? Close? I-20s? Net? Net-zines? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3733.81-3740.82: So far this year, our re-trans revenue growth has exceeded 20%. That is correct. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3741.38-3744.86: We have budgeted for mid-teens. Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3745.47-3746.97: While 28 in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3748.11-3749.93: I forget what exactly the first quarter is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3750.07-3758.72: We budgeted for mid-teens growth in net re-trans for the entire year, but so far we have exceeded that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3760.00-3763.00: So net retrans margins are down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3764.14-3767.41: You know, more than a little bit this year. Is that correct? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3768.05-3770.61: No, I would say that they're actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3770.63-3783.56: Up a little bit because we've included a fair amount of Tribune subscribers that are non-Big Four affiliates where our net retrans margin is substantially in excess of 50%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3784.70-3786.13: Got it, thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3790.25-3794.25: Now I'll take our next question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3796.48-3799.38: Thanks. During the early days of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3799.40-3804.78: The pandemic, there seemed to be a surge in, or a pretty good increase at least in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3804.80-3810.79: Usage and even sampling of broadcast and other video. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3811.21-3816.62: In categories that didn't take or didn't tend to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3816.98-3818.14: And be requested. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3819.04-3823.24: If you would like to cancel this request, please press star zero again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3825.55-3826.61: Not sure what happened there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3828.41-3831.91: But I was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3832.77-3839.24: Your support request has been cancelled. If you would like to cancel this request, please press star zero again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3840.86-3843.00: I'm sorry, am I heard? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3845.83-3850.51: Go ahead, Jim. I think somebody's trying to either record or exit the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3851.39-3861.20: Okay, sorry. But anyway, I was wondering if any of the increased usage and sampling has proven sustainable, or has it mostly dissipated? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3861.38-3866.37: Did any of that play a role in your re-trans negotiations during that period? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3869.05-3878.58: We had precious few re-trans negotiations done in the first half of the year. We had one top ten that were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3878.60-3880.78: You know, we're pleased with the results on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3881.32-3886.91: I would say, you know, in my comments earlier, I did report that, you know, our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3886.93-3888.05: Our viewership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3888.07-3891.05: And I highlighted the 18 to 34 demographic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3891.07-3899.38: You know, obviously it was up in April 151%, 83% in May, and 89% in June over the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3900.16-3908.55: Our digital page views, which were in excess of 2.3 billion for the quarter, were 1.1 billion in April. That was up 133%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3909.03-3915.60: And then in the month of June, just by comparison, our local websites were up 60% compared to the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3917.56-3925.51: You know, there is some COVID fatigue, I think, but I also think there is increased interest in local news and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3925.57-3935.06: We consider ourselves to be the last bastion of local news with the diminution of newspaper and radio local coverage and content. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3935.12-3942.04: We do think that there is stickiness to this. The long tail will determine how much, but... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3942.06-3945.91: But people continue to turn to our newscasts in record numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3946.27-3947.59: And it's amazing you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3947.87-3957.48: ATLA in Los Angeles and WGN in Chicago, independent stations by and large, but producing copious amounts of local news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3958.36-3972.47: Are ranking number one in all day parts, beating all of the network O and O's in virtually every newscast. And that just speaks to the power of localism, that you're not dependent on network lead in or lead out to generate your audience. You're doing it on your own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3972.49-3978.30: And we're particularly gratified by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3980.00-3982.88: Okay, and one last thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3982.90-3992.41: I was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for News Nation as that is coming to the fore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3992.95-4001.84: And also, it seems like CNN tended to fill a similar role to that which you're targeting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4001.86-4003.60: Where it tended to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4003.62-4006.45: Unbiased, maybe it's a little less so these days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4006.91-4008.09: And it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4008.31-4017.38: In that era, it would tend to be the place to go when an event occurred. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4017.42-4029.13: Some of the other more pointed newscasts, politically, would sort of gather their base in more normal times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4029.17-4040.40: I'm wondering if there's a way for you to position yourself to sort of gather at least that role and maybe have something more sustainable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4040.44-4045.17: And if this proves successful, do you think you'd broaden it beyond the three-hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4045.19-4046.39: Original time frame. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4048.65-4052.81: Thanks Jim, there's a lot in there to unpack. I'll try and do my best with it here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4054.01-4063.84: Obviously, that is how CNN started. I don't think anyone listening to this call thinks CNN is in that same place today from an unbiased political lean. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4064.90-4072.63: We, as I've said before, we have a staff of rhetoricians and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4072.65-4079.56: Unconscious bias and bias in our writing and we've had very spirited discussions about that even in the rehearsals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4082.48-4090.79: We do think we will be that place to go for news that doesn't make a 22-minute news hole in a network evening news broadcast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4090.81-4095.10: Much news on the opinion-based talk networks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4096.10-4102.06: For example, last night in our rehearsals we did a story on the first women police chief in Colorado Springs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4102.10-4108.27: And that's not a story you'd see every place else. But again, we've got the country divided up into six zones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4108.29-4112.57: We have zone producers and their job is to know exactly what's going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4112.59-4126.81: In those zones, in all of those newsrooms, and what might be of interest to a national audience, in addition to the 150 people we've hired in Chicago, correspondents that are also based in Miami, New York, Dallas, Los Angeles,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4126.83-4134.45: And DC that report exclusively for the network, as well as all the behind-the-scenes production folks that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4134.47-4143.80: That we think we can give a more representative view of America than perhaps what's seen inside the New York, D.C. Beltway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4145.01-4154.33: So we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason for that and the acceptance of that concept now has been very enthusiastic. It's now just on us to deliver. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4154.71-4159.00: As it relates to promotion, we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4159.02-4169.39: I think that's a good point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4169.45-4175.60: Across the next star nation to promote this newscast on a day-to-day specific basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4175.80-4177.44: Beginning later this month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4177.84-4187.47: And if you look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis, it's something approaching $100 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4188.17-4195.88: We are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately $20 million of outside promotion expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4196.00-4198.66: Which primarily goes for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4198.68-4200.70: Advertising on other cable networks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4200.76-4203.36: Because we're just a channel change away. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4203.60-4207.13: At that point on national and syndicated radio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4207.61-4217.04: We're also investing heavily in social media, not only because of the app, but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative newscast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4217.22-4218.82: We think our promotion... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4218.90-4225.73: All taken together, a nine-figure amount of both cash and in-kind contributions for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4225.89-4231.61: Are another asset that will hopefully drive success for this effort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4232.25-4240.08: And again, it is a counter-programming opportunity in prime time, and we're going to do our best to succeed there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4240.50-4247.77: Obviously, if we are successful, we would look at other day parts, but we're taking very much of a crawl, walk, run approach to this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4248.03-4253.73: We want to get it right and we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4254.15-4259.66: So I think I'd leave it at that, but we're very excited about the prospect of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4259.68-4266.21: Of introducing an alternative in prime time to entertainment, sports, and opinion programming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4266.41-4270.15: And that the product will reach a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4270.17-4276.64: We'll strike a chord and resonate with the audience, and then audience growth and advertiser growth will continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4278.48-4280.56: Tune in, it launches on September 1st. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4282.12-4283.36: Thank you. Catch you later. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4287.71-4294.07: And that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Suk for any additional or closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4295.40-4297.56: Well, thank you, operator. Again, we're. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4297.58-4307.45: We're very pleased at our progress and we're pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of WGN America and the advent of the political spending season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4307.47-4317.34: That will all be upon us before our next call. So we look forward to reporting back to you shortly after Election Day with the early results on all of those efforts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4317.40-4320.00: And thank you very much for your time this morning. Thanks for joining us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4323.02-4327.99: And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
