asr:0: OUTPUT 142.46-147.25: This morning I'll cover a variety of areas, review the results of the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 147.27-155.58: Discussed recent regulatory developments including the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 156.50-161.74: Provide an update on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with ORSAT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 162.74-170.23: I'll start with slide 2, noting that recurring earnings were $1.02 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 170.25-175.02: Compared with recurring earnings of 98 cents per share in the third quarter of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 175.68-187.09: GAAP results which include a charge of one cent per share relating to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia GAAP of Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 187.11-191.87: Total $1.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 193.17-199.88: In the first nine months of 2020, our recurring earnings, excluding Columbia gas acquisition costs,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 199.94-207.97: Total $2.80 per share compared with recurring earnings of $2.69 per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 207.99-209.47: In the first nine months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 209.95-215.42: And excluding the northern path transmission impairment charge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 216.34-221.56: GAAP results for September of this year were $2.76 per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 223.02-228.85: Turning to our business segments, our electric distribution segment are in 60 cents. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 228.87-235.36: Per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 236.32-243.94: The lower earnings were a result of both higher storm restoration costs and property tax expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 243.96-246.73: As well as the impact of shared dilution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 248.05-252.99: Our electric transmission segment earned 36 cents per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 253.23-259.04: Compared with recurring earnings of 33 cents per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 259.62-260.64: And 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 261.24-270.65: Improved results were driven by the continued investment and reliability in our transmission facilities, partially offset by shared dilution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 272.27-279.72: Our natural gas distribution segment lost 4 cents per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared with a loss of 5 cents. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 279.74-282.90: Per share in the third quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 283.58-285.77: Improve results due to higher revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.35-294.35: I should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 294.91-304.38: Until October 9th. The transaction had no impact on this, the gas segment, this segment during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 305.39-313.83: Each quarter this year we've booked acquisition related costs at the parent and have segregated them for increased transparency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 315.38-324.72: Beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, ongoing results of our new gas franchise, which is named Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.74-327.75: Will be reflected in the natural gas segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 328.61-338.30: Integration related costs, however, will continue to be recorded separately at the parent and excluded from our recurring gap earnings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 340.08-349.49: Our water distribution segment earned $0.07 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared with earnings of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 350.41-359.78: In 2016, improved results were due to a $3.5 million after-tax gain on the sale of Arhenem,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 359.80-362.52: That's area facilities to the town. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.16-372.93: Episodus Parrot earned three cents per share in the third quarter of 2020, excluding the Columbia Gap of Massachusetts asset acquisition cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 373.55-376.96: Equal to our earnings in the third quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 378.32-382.36: As you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on slide three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 383.14-391.19: We are reaffirming our 2020 earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.70. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 391.27-398.58: And that is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 399.48-409.13: We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5 to 7% from our core regulated business through the year 2024. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 409.95-417.00: We continue to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range, largely due to the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 417.02-420.82: We need to make on behalf of our customers as we go live for you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 420.84-422.06: Earlier in the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 423.26-424.28: As a reminder. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 424.30-433.59: While we fully expect the Columbia gas assets to be accreted to our earnings per share starting immediately in 2021,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 434.19-440.50: We have not yet updated our long-term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of Columbia Gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 440.52-444.46: Assets in our capital, our cutbacks, and our earnings growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 445.47-453.21: In addition, as we've disclosed previously, earnings from offshore wind would be incremental to our core business growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 453.59-459.04: Will provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 459.42-464.10: Adding in Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts projections. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 464.12-470.93: And provide an update of our offshore wind partnership during our year-end call in late February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 472.53-484.02: From the third quarter results, I'll turn to slide four and our experience restoring power after Tropical Storm Isaias ravaged Connecticut on October 4th. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 484.90-487.53: We've got a hundred forty nine uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 487.55-494.91: In Connecticut and every one of these communities suffered damage from East Ayes, much of it catastrophic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 495.82-502.50: As you can see on the slide, we had nearly 22,000 damaged locations that we had to address. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.54-507.75: And brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 508.45-512.41: All the while working on the restoration in a pandemic setting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.81-523.76: The restoration process lasted 9 days, meaning we completed our work 1-2 days faster than we had in the last 2 tropical storms that hit Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 524.30-528.77: Even though we had 30 to 35% more damage locations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.97-540.14: And most importantly, we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact and no COVID exposure among the enormous workforce we brought to Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.78-547.93: Just a tremendous effort by all of our employees from across all parts of Eversource. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.61-558.80: At this time, we estimate that deferred costs across all three states will total more than $275 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.34-563.22: But the vast majority of that's incurred in Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 565.79-569.09: That figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 569.65-578.32: We're still actively pursuing invoices from hundreds of vendors that assisted us during the statewide restoration effort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 579.48-588.13: Where we were setting new poles or hanging miles of new wires or replacing hundreds of transformers, these related costs ought to be capitalized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 589.15-598.02: The ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance in safely and expeditiously restoring power to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 598.04-604.52: Is pending an ongoing review by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 605.25-611.09: That review is scheduled to be completed in late April of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 612.79-621.72: Sticking with our regulated business, I'll turn to slide five and a review of this year's distribution rate reviews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 623.02-631.97: This past Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities issued its decision in the NSTAR gas rate review that we filed last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.75-638.66: It supports our continued investment in the NSTAR GATS system on behalf of our 300,000 customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 639.72-646.77: The decision allows NSTAR GAS to increase distribution revenues by $23 million on an annualized basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 647.91-655.22: The GPU approved an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure with a 54.77% equity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 657.28-662.70: It also permits us to implement performance-based rate making for a 10-year term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 662.72-673.29: That with sound operating performance by Antidargas will target annual base rate increases of inflation plus 1.03%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 674.57-682.72: This is an earnings sharing mechanism that would return 75% of the benefit to customers should we exceed the ROE of 10.9%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 683.36-687.91: And sharing mechanism on the downside if our ROE falls below 8.4%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.69-694.69: Also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 696.46-700.14: Our other longstanding rape proceeding involves public service of New Hampshire. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 700.90-711.47: In an answer last month, we and all the parties to the PSNH rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review that is pending for nearly a year and a half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.71-725.79: As you can see from the slides, we settled on a $45 million annualized rate increase that includes a 9.3% return on equity and a 54.4% equity layer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 726.85-734.27: Should regulators approve the settlement, the permanent increase would take effect on January 1st of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.50-745.13: You may recall that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission allowed us to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately $28 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.15-749.05: Back in July, July 1st of 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.25-754.73: The final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date, 18 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 755.86-761.38: We would recover that in a true-up over the course of the year 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 762.82-769.29: We can consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome to PSNH's first general increase in about a decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 770.35-776.12: And have asked the New Hampshire PUC to approve the settlement before the end of November. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.26-786.71: From the rate reviews, I'll turn to slide six, and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 787.51-792.01: For $1.1 billion of cash, excluding working capital adjustments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 793.59-802.56: Most of these assets were assigned to Everswiss Gas Company in Massachusetts, a new subsidiary I mentioned that we formed in May of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.84-812.21: As you can see on the slide, much of Episodic Gas' service territory is adjacent to NSTAR gas or Yankee gas service territories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.75-821.30: Additionally, NSTAR Electric already provides electric service to about 20 of the communities that Eversource Gas serves with natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 822.06-831.43: As a result, we expect to realize operational benefits for our newest 330,000 natural gas customers in the communities where they live. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.85-840.50: The finance of the transaction, we sold approximately $500 million of equity in June. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.54-844.40: And we financed the debt portion of the transaction in August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 845.19-853.91: And again, we are very confident that this transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share in 2021 and incrementally accretive in the years ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 855.34-861.92: A critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits to all stakeholders is an eight-year rate plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 861.94-865.45: That we negotiated with the Massachusetts Attorney General. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.47-871.27: And other key priorities prior to our filing with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.27-875.34: The key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 876.02-885.06: It will allow us to make the necessary investments in our ever-source gas of mass system and reflect those investments and rates in a reasonably timely manner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.79-889.81: We're thankful that the DPU approved the settlement and the acquisition very quickly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 890.41-895.80: I'm not happy to the property and I want to play in place we are we have focused. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 895.82-906.79: On providing our new Eversource gas customers with the same high level of service that we provide our other 550,000 National Gas Distribution Company customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 906.81-909.33: That we have in Massachusetts and Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 910.83-920.24: As I noted earlier, we plan to integrate and resource gas of Massachusetts into our updated five-year projections that we'll provide you in February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 921.96-927.83: We continue to project approximately $3 billion of regulated company capital investments this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.45-934.23: Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 934.25-939.70: For a significant part of August to deal with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Isaias. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.42-946.41: Through September, our capital investments totaled approximately $2.2 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 947.13-952.25: That's approximately the same level as this time last year in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 953.01-957.42: We made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 957.44-963.18: Putting several projects into service at or below budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.20-968.81: The lower cost will flow through to New England's electric customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 970.23-975.90: From the regulated business, I'll turn to offshore wind partnership with Orsted on slide 8. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.14-980.86: We've had a few developments since our July 31st earnings call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 981.78-995.26: The most significant development was that in August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management posted a complete review schedule for our 130 megawatt South Fork project on Long Island. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 996.18-1003.58: The schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit or COP as it's known. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1003.64-1006.23: In mid-January of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1007.61-1010.49: We are also making progress on the other permits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1010.63-1026.05: In September, we filed a settlement proposal with the New York Department of Public Service to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the construction, operations, and maintenance of the project that lies within New York jurisdiction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1027.35-1034.91: In October, several of New York State's agencies signaled their support for this proposal by signing on to the agreement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1036.48-1046.29: We've structured an agreement on host community payments and the necessary real estate rights with the town of East Hampton where the offshore cable would land. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1046.31-1049.05: And will be connected to the Long Island grid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1050.39-1056.86: New York Public Service Commission siding hearings for South Fork are scheduled to commence the first week of December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1057.86-1065.19: We continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in 2021 before BOEM issues the cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1066.69-1072.15: Based on that schedule, we now expect the project to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1072.79-1082.60: This is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our May and July earnings calls while we were still waiting for the review schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.80-1090.63: Turning to our other project, you recall that we filed our BOEM application for Revolution Wind in March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.41-1097.22: We expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.78-1104.46: We do not expect to provide an updated in-service date for this project until the schedule is issued. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1104.60-1111.63: But at this point, it's unlikely that the project will end its service by the end of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1113.13-1122.36: Also, we filed our sunrise wind application with BOEM on September 1st and expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for the project next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1123.32-1129.77: Once we receive that review schedule, we'll be able to better estimate a more up-to-date in-service schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.47-1135.44: But again, at this time, it would seem that the end of 24 in service is not likely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1137.12-1143.68: We are very optimistic about our offshore wind business and expect to have many opportunities over the coming months and years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1143.72-1150.63: To expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the 1,714 megawatts currently under contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1151.73-1158.14: As we mentioned before, we have enough leaf capacity to construct at least 4,000 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1158.16-1166.69: On the 550 square miles of ocean tracks that we have under long-term lease off the southeast coast of Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.17-1176.82: To this point, on October 20th, we submitted a number of alternative bids into the second New York offshore wind RFP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.84-1181.88: Where the state is looking for between 1,000 and 2,500 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.16-1190.53: New York state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner or winners before the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1191.57-1200.54: Our Sunrise project, as a reminder, won the largest portion of New York's first RMP last year, 880 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.28-1215.44: Additionally, just last week, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo announced that her state will target early next year for issuing an RFP to 600 megawatts of additional offshore wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.18-1224.98: As you know, the majority of our Revolution Wind capacity, 400 megawatts, will be sold to Rhode Island with the balance going to Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1227.33-1231.71: Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call back over to Jeff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1233.31-1239.38: Thanks, Phil. And I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how to enter questions in the Q&A queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1241.12-1245.67: Thank you. If you do have a question, press star then 1 on your touchtone phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1246.11-1253.01: Once again, that's Darden 1, our new touch-tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.32-1261.50: Thank you, John. Our first question this morning is from Char from Guggenheim. Good morning, Char. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1262.62-1265.37: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Phil. Good morning, Chuck. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.87-1276.76: So a couple questions here. Just some of your language around sort of the growth rate, obviously which still excludes Columbia gas and offshore wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.30-1282.44: Obviously these are very creative and you're already conservatively kind of well within your band. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1282.86-1290.35: So should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items as potentially reining your growth rate to maybe 6 to 8 percent? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1290.67-1296.46: Or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.26-1306.33: The reason I ask is 6 to 8% seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket in our space where 5 to 7% is becoming a little bit more typical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.67-1309.01: So curious how you're sort of thinking about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.33-1317.94: Do you see value to be in the top quartile or you don't think you're going to get rewarded for it? So curious on that as we think about you layering its plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.26-1323.58: Sure, sure, thanks for the question and I hope you are doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.01-1333.23: Certainly the addition of Columbia gas will be additive to our existing forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1333.39-1341.14: So we're working through all the details of that so we're able to provide you with a full update in February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.16-1347.01: We expect to get significant benefits from that franchise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1347.53-1352.81: And as you say, we also expect as those offshore wind projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1352.83-1369.49: Come online to also be additive. To remind folks, I know I said it, and you did, that the 5 to 7% growth rate is from the existing core business, which doesn't include Columbia assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.85-1374.23: It also doesnít include grid modernization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.25-1383.30: Activities that are currently pending in Connecticut and New Hampshire or AMI that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.32-1393.05: Could be a potential to move forward relatively soon in Massachusetts in terms of taking a look at that by the regulator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1393.77-1402.96: So I see that we have a number of levers to grow and grow at even a higher rate than we had expected before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.96-1406.03: Got it. That's helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.71-1415.03: And then Phil, just lastly for me, can you just maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for the legislation in Connecticut? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1415.08-1420.08: The legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation, but obviously. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1420.10-1425.85: Some disappointment with the refunds and penalties offset by the potential upside from my PBRs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.23-1428.55: So sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.79-1437.28: Sure, the energy legislation, we've said consistently that PBR is a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.30-1442.62: Is a formula and a template that we think is effective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.64-1446.37: We have PVR structures in other states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.47-1458.52: And we think that having a robust discussion on PBR in Connecticut makes a lot of sense. So we're very supportive of that provision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.20-1472.37: Really, the energy legislation directed Pura to evaluate that and open a docket by the middle of next year, so June of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.39-1480.28: And it authorizes PURE to establish storm standards and potential penalties, as you mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.74-1486.89: There is an increased potential of penalties. Currently,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.91-1492.49: Those penalties are 2.5% of our distribution revenues in Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1492.69-1495.03: And that goes up to 4%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.58-1504.24: So, you know, it also gives Bureau some additional time to review cases, which is also something that seems to be appropriate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.95-1509.85: The legislation, as you indicated, is out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1510.11-1519.34: And PURE is working through the details of it and we expect to be working through that in a constructive way with them over the next several months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.16-1523.84: Got it. Terrific. That's all I have today. Thanks, guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1525.23-1531.71: Thanks, Char. Our next question is from Steve Fleischman from Wolf. Good morning, Steve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1534.23-1540.70: Good morning. Folks, can you hear me? Yes, Steve, I can. Great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1541.38-1550.83: So just a question on the delays in your offshore wind projects. Could you maybe talk to, I know we don't know the exact timing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1551.61-1554.49: But how should we think about the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.51-1563.08: Impact on the economics of those projects from delay or puts and takes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1563.12-1567.69: And is it hurting the economics of the projects you already have signed up to? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1570.63-1579.92: Thanks for your questions, Stephen. I hope you and your family are doing well. I guess to go to the puts and takes piece. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.76-1595.40: I do not think that folks should automatically think that schedule changes result in ups or downs. There are some benefits that people may not consider in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1595.48-1600.00: So certainly if you are looking at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.08-1612.91: Adjusted schedules, you might be able to adjust your installation vessel optimization better. You know, the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.97-1631.17: You could move to larger turbine sizes if projects are due at a later time period versus an earlier time period. Certainly, the cost, supply chain and availability of materials and supply chain is only getting better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.21-1641.74: So I'd say that there's opportunities for improved cost economics as you move into a schedule that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1642.42-1649.63: You may not think of, I think people generally think of projects as if there's a delay, it's a cost increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1649.73-1654.15: There are other elements that work here on the offshore wind business that offset that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.18-1666.41: How about any negatives? Are you going to lose any tax credits or anything else? I guess just time value? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.97-1675.76: In terms of the schedules we're looking at, we don't expect to have any impact on our tax assumptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1676.02-1679.80: But certainly significant delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.92-1695.56: Delays could have impacts on your tax assumptions. Delays could also have impacts on contrast that you have with counterparties. In our specific case, so that's the general case, in our specific case,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.86-1704.66: We're confident that we have the ability to work within both of those, the tax area and the contract area, in an effective way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1704.80-1708.03: With where we see the schedules going in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.19-1720.84: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1722.46-1730.81: Good morning. I have a question about Massachusetts. You know, they've had this very constructive decision for MTHRGAS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1731.59-1736.18: Of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1737.66-1746.81: And so how do you guys see it, especially in light of the fact that you just acquired an additional gas utility in Massachusetts? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1749.45-1753.83: Good morning, Angie, and thank you for your question and hope you're doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1756.68-1762.58: The way that I would position it or the way that I think people should think about it is that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1762.68-1775.52: There's nobody, first of all, who's more aggressive in terms of looking at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction than Eversource in terms of having a carbon neutral goal by 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1775.54-1782.70: We have worked effectively with all parties in all states, but in Massachusetts where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1782.72-1786.37: The Attorney General and others want to take a look at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.41-1792.91: You know, sort of the future or the outlook in terms of the gas business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1793.87-1801.42: We've been working with these intervening parties for many years and will continue to work with them on what. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1801.46-1804.58: We think an appropriate strategy is there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1805.87-1813.49: This is a long-term outlook in terms of what the state wants to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1813.55-1823.74: Have aggressive clean energy and carbon reduction targets. We're fully supportive of that and we look forward to working with all the parties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1823.90-1831.51: But we don't see it as a threat to the gas distribution business in the region at all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.02-1844.44: In Connecticut, there's this recent back and forth between you guys and PORA about the extension of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1844.46-1848.39: The lack of basic connections on the back of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1850.03-1857.36: I mean, it sounds a bit concerning that poor is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1858.36-1867.81: I mean, I would assume that it's a natural practice, normal practice for a regulated utility to seek a recovery of these under-recovered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.83-1868.93: Revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1869.45-1875.68: Can you give us a sense of how you see it in Connecticut, given the latest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1875.72-1880.34: On legislative changes and also some deterioration and then, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.36-1882.50: Of regular relationships on the stage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1884.70-1892.53: Yes, so we are not doing shutoffs across any of our franchises at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1892.55-1908.07: Specifically, we're working with customers, we're working with fuel agencies, assistance agencies on an approach here that works best for customers. We've also engaged with Pura. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1908.09-1913.93: As you mentioned, and other government officials on this issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.05-1918.42: So I'm confident that we'll get to a good place here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1918.44-1930.59: You know, nobody wants to burden customers with any more than we're all ready, all of us are burdened with in terms of the economic conditions and COVID, et cetera. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1931.13-1940.96: We're working through the issue. We're working with customers, as I say, and some of the assistance agencies. And I'm sure we'll get to a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1941.28-1945.01: A good outcome here. Very good. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1946.23-1952.19: Thank you, Angie. Next question is from Julian from Bank of America. Good morning, Julian. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1953.91-1958.84: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. I hope all of you are doing well and safe, and families as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.96-1968.85: Perhaps just to pick up off of, or perhaps clarify if I can, some of the last rounds of questions. When you talk about the 4Q roll forward,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.31-1978.44: Are you enrolling to 2025? And then more specifically, how do you think about including or excluding offshore wind in light of the uncertainties described? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1978.72-1986.47: Should we expect that offshore wind should continue to be at least for those projects where there's an undetermined date to continue to be excluded there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1988.49-1993.63: Jimmy, thanks for your question and your comments that I hope you and your family are doing well too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1994.51-2004.10: Just to clarify, our history has been to add another year into the outlook, so 2025 would be that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2004.12-2010.97: That year since our forecast goes through the 2024 time period, so that is something that you should expect to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.77-2021.70: And really our view on how to look at offshore wind, it doesn't change by any of the schedule items we talked about today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.88-2033.13: We've looked at it as showing the core business as the driver and the foundational element of the growth rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2033.23-2048.75: And then to show that wind is additive to that in what way. So that would be the intent going forward. I think that what I've been asked this question before, the answer is, was and still is,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2048.81-2058.96: As more years of wind come in to the actual results of that particular year, then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2058.98-2067.49: But at this stage, the expectation, especially in this upcoming February update, would be to have the core business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2067.53-2069.17: Extend that through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2069.19-2075.88: 20-25 and then show offshore wind in addition to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2078.46-2088.13: If you don't mind elaborating a little bit further, I know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the permitting schedule that inhibits your ability to say when these projects are in a region service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.57-2098.26: Can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take, such that there's like a window, if you will? It may be too early. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.08-2103.98: Yeah, so in terms of, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.02-2109.77: There's people who have realized out there, and we've been asked questions,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2109.83-2113.51: I think you've asked us the questions in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2113.53-2115.22: You know, with delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2115.24-2127.97: Some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.11-2136.24: We would have expected in our original schedules that some of these NOIs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2136.42-2141.00: To prepare the environmental impact statement would be out by now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.56-2151.27: So these are expected, I believe, you know, the planned schedule for reviewing and releasing these is underway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2151.43-2167.49: So I wouldn't expect a significant change in the schedule, but at this stage, it would be prudent to wait to see the schedule that comes out of the phone before we commit to a final in-service date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2168.95-2170.39: I wouldn't expect it to be significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2173.37-2183.16: Got it. Excellent. All right. I'll pass it from there. Thank you so much. Steve. Thanks, Julian. Next question is from Dergesh from Evercore. Good morning, Dergesh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.01-2192.29: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the offshore wind here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.85-2194.29: What to expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2194.31-2203.92: You know there's this uh eis uh decision i suppose that is going to be out or you escape and rather this month or or early december. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2203.98-2208.55: What to expect there, and then how does that impact your future project guidelines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2211.43-2212.75: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2212.87-2218.08: Steve, notice of intents that contain a planned schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2218.18-2224.80: You know, in the NOIs, they have contained bones planned, scheduled for reviewing each of the cops. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.39-2230.37: So that would be an important piece of information to have available. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.51-2239.76: So that's really what's included in that. It's a planned schedule for reviewing the cost that comes out with the notice of intent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.92-2251.47: I guess maybe I'm talking about the environmental impact statement. Isn't there an environmental impact statement that BOEM is supposed to sort of put out here in the next few weeks? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2254.57-2258.80: You're talking about the one for vineyard right? Yes. Yes. Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.10-2267.95: I apologize, you probably have to ask Vinny Guinn about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2268.99-2275.62: Okay, but that doesn't have a read-through for you or your offshore wind project, but I guess that's what my question was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.44-2279.18: Well, certainly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2279.54-2284.32: All of the developers off the coast, you know, that we've been going through this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.48-2296.02: Cumulative impact study and looking at spacing of wind turbines and we came up with a one nautical mile by one nautical mile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2296.04-2307.81: So, certainly, there could be components that come out in any decision for vignette wind that you'd have to take a look at to see if it has any impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.59-2310.55: You know, to other developers, including us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.51-2319.78: But in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing, I think Vignit might have a better perspective of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2321.64-2331.27: Okay, perfect. That's all I had, guys. Thank you so much. All right. Thanks, Durgesh. Next question is from Jeremy from J.P. Morgan. Good morning, Jeremy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2332.67-2333.93: Good morning. Thanks for having me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2335.90-2344.50: I just want to start off with what are the benefits of looping Con Ed into the proposed Sunrise Wind 2 RFP here? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2345.11-2353.41: Eversource has experience with building transmission and we're curious what additional competitive advantages ConEd provides here to this specific project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2354.11-2362.60: Can you provide details on potential ownership interests for each entity and does ownership interest change once construction is complete and the project is in service? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.17-2368.19: Thanks for your question, Jeremy. I hope you're doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2368.41-2372.15: I guess I would say on the first part of the question that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2372.17-2377.48: Obviously, ClimEd has local knowledge of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2377.50-2393.57: Of New York in their service territory and the network and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that are valuable to any party if you're operating in New York. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2393.63-2409.91: I'd say they bring a knowledge and skill set of the area that certainly we don't have as depth of knowledge as they would. So, there's sort of skill sets there that the local. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2409.95-2411.29: A player would bring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.95-2421.36: So in terms of what the components of a relationship would be, those things are all... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2421.40-2428.15: To be discussed as we move through, but it's certainly beneficial, I think, to the project to have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2428.17-2432.01: Somebody with kind of skill sets involved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2438.94-2444.60: Got it. And as far as potential ownership interests, is there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2447.39-2450.55: Not at this time, no. Got it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2451.45-2460.98: And then, will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any impact on the current financing plans? Is it fair to assume the $700 million of equity in your current five-year plan? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.44-2470.59: Moves to the back end here and how is offshore wind capex spending track Peter day versus the three to four hundred million range that you expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2474.25-2483.38: We haven't disclosed a range that we've expected. We've talked about how much we expected to spend this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.56-2488.09: You know, you know, you know, just for the year 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2488.77-2495.70: It's tracking somewhat close to that. I'd say it's probably a little bit under what we expected at this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2497.82-2499.48: In terms of the financing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2499.78-2508.31: You're right that we announced a year ago, you know, the $2 billion of equity need that would support the forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2508.39-2516.08: We issued 1.3 of that, so there's $700 million remaining that we're not able to meet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.10-2521.94: And I would say the same thing as I've said all along is we'd be opportunistic and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.96-2529.89: Consider what our capital forecasts are and what the market conditions are as we look. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2529.91-2533.33: To fulfill the rest of that offering that we discussed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2536.16-2538.08: Got it that's helpful I'll leave it there thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2539.38-2547.87: Thanks, Jeremy. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glen Rock. Good morning, Paul. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Paul. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2549.97-2557.10: I just wanted to follow up on the draft decision in Connecticut on Monday. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2557.12-2560.18: What are your thoughts on it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.82-2567.19: If it were in fact become a a final order what the uh... What the potential impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2569.09-2575.78: Are you talking about the draft information on rates? Can you be more specific? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.06-2584.34: Sure, there was a draft decision on Monday in the Pura case associated with the rape. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.38-2589.43: The rate review that was reversed that proceeding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2589.53-2592.15: Uh... I can tell you that the specific meaning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2593.17-2601.92: Okay, I just wanted to be specific because as somebody else mentioned, there's been a number of different... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.17-2610.57: So as you recall, the purist suspended the rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2610.59-2616.32: That we had implemented over the summer, both we and UI, to take an additional look. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2616.84-2618.30: I think this is what you're referring to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2618.64-2623.28: So we did receive the draft order and really it's kind of hot off the press. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2623.30-2632.33: Evaluating that and we're going to see what comments we might have and comments on the draft could do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2632.99-2639.28: I think it's the 12th of November, so we have some time to flush out anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2639.30-2650.85: But it's consistent with, on first blush I'd say, it's consistent with the purist desire to have some rate changes, you know, move. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2650.95-2656.98: Instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage, maybe such as July, implement them on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2657.06-2664.12: Change the timing of it to implement it maybe in a shoulder month like May or something. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2664.14-2669.81: And moved to annual reconciliations as opposed to semi-annual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2670.53-2677.78: So this would, you know, if there's delay, this could have, effectively, this is a cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2677.88-2680.60: Item that could have an impact on our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2680.62-2685.25: Our deferrals that we have in place there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.73-2694.25: I think it generally is consistent with the desire, as we said, to move off of these peak periods for making rate changes into shoulder periods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2694.37-2702.42: And see what we build from there. But we're actively reviewing that last night and today, and we will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2702.44-2707.03: And have any comments that we would have with you, as I said, on the 12th. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2707.77-2709.45: Okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2709.61-2715.12: There was one part of it that would reduce the preparing charges uh... From the uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.14-2720.24: From whack to a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2721.80-2724.68: Is there any, do we have any? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2724.94-2734.81: I know this is all off the press and everything, but do we have any sort of forecast as to what those reconciliation mechanisms, like how much capital might be tied up in those? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2737.68-2738.84: You did. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2738.88-2745.03: That is a point to the carrying cost at prime. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2745.05-2748.91: Which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2749.09-2750.11: I guess so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2750.83-2756.44: No, it's not a significant item, but it's a significant item. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2756.48-2766.45: It's certainly one that Pura had put out there in the draft is to recover the deferred balances with a prime rate versus a non-prime rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2766.47-2768.45: Allah Allah. Okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2769.19-2773.95: And then just, we don't know who the president's going to be, it seems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2774.43-2777.14: But if there was a change in administration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2777.16-2786.95: Do you think that could have or not have maybe a significant impact on the B O E M permitting process with respect to offshore wind? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2790.07-2797.10: The permitting process, I mean, when we meet with BOAM, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2797.12-2800.26: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2800.46-2801.64: I would. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2801.68-2816.20: People are active. We're actively working. We're actively having Zoom meetings or Teams calls or whatever the video capabilities are that we're using. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2816.38-2818.70: But we're actively working that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2818.72-2830.93: And I can assure you that the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless of who's president or what the election results are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2830.97-2840.22: But certainly it would be good to have, you know, the results of the election, I think, revolve as a country, you know, that,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2840.58-2848.83: The election results are something that we've all targeted out there and wherever you fall on the political spectrum, it's good to have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2849.23-2856.54: Certainty as opposed to uncertainty. So I think we're all looking forward to what the final outcome is there so we can move forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2857.28-2860.26: Okay, just for my clarity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2860.86-2866.49: The process of the p o e m is pretty much the the agency that the sort of bureaucratic process that's going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2866.87-2876.22: Really you don't see a significant change one way or the other, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election. Is that my right understanding? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2877.04-2880.66: I'd say that the work at the agencies is going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.84-2888.59: We've been meeting regularly, going through questions, we're working through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2888.61-2894.75: The various state agencies. So, no, I'd say that the work is continuing at the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2894.77-2897.68: As you say, the bureaucrat level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2898.52-2900.30: Okay, awesome. Thanks so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2902.16-2911.77: Thanks, Paul. Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike. Hey, good morning. Morning, Phil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2913.51-2915.32: Okay, good. I hope you're doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2915.76-2917.98: Maybe you could just give a quick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2918.78-2920.20: Two-second update on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2920.22-2929.57: Of what you think uh... The ultimate for might be for uh... Transmission are we use it uh... Considering our work if you are shall come back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2929.59-2931.65: Has any effect on any of this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2931.77-2933.03: Accelerating an outcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2936.44-2942.08: Well, Mike, that's a very big crystal ball that you're asking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2943.10-2947.11: But again, thanks and I hope you're doing well. Thanks for your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2947.65-2956.70: You know, it's, I wish I had a, you know, a better answer than to say that, you know, it's working its way through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2956.74-2969.01: We don't really have a specific clarity as to when FERC might come up with something on the New England before pending. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2969.03-2971.17: New England cases and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2971.19-2980.26: Certainly impact of the election one way or the other, what that could have in terms of commissioners and that type of thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2980.28-2981.50: So... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2982.40-2991.23: The only thing I know for certain is we're booking at our 10.57 rate and reserving to that level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2991.25-2994.19: 11.74 caps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2995.18-3000.32: And, you know, we'll just have to wait and see what the final outcome will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3000.76-3006.51: Will look at, but I don't really have an answer. I know in years past when I've tried to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3006.59-3011.87: When I tried to think that one was coming or it was going a certain way, it really hadn't. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3011.89-3019.08: Hasn't materialized, so I think it's best to wait for the final order comes out at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3021.46-3025.13: A bigger crystal ball question would be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3025.55-3032.49: I know that Hydro-Quebec has a pretty big long-term construction plan for hydro generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3032.51-3038.52: Up there and I know that their long-term plans included lots and lots of northern pass-type transmission lines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3040.14-3049.27: Do you think there's ever a time at some point where there might be another whack or another go at transmission at some point, a big transmission project? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.45-3058.22: I think a lot of that is dependent upon what the states want to get, right? So, these are going to be processes now that are driven by. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3058.64-3071.13: State's clean energy policies and the state's desire to have either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3071.19-3078.24: So, you know, there are certainly, there's a lot of activity at the states now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3078.38-3087.47: I mean the states in our area all want aggressive carbon reduction targets so we wouldn't be out of the question to see a state. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3087.59-3095.32: We want to contract for more of that, but there's nothing planned on our end as of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3095.38-3100.38: There's nothing that I see at this stage on the state's agenda that would say that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3100.78-3103.20: When you say the word ever, you know, that's a long time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3104.92-3110.47: So it seems like the offshore wind program really has kind of supplanted that, at least for the time being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3111.29-3114.71: Yeah, I'd say that's a good way of looking at it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3115.94-3124.62: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Okay, thanks, Mike. Our next question is from Insu Kim from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Insu. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3125.89-3129.09: Good morning guys. My only question is, and apologies if I... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3129.11-3132.97: Mrs. But could you give just an update on the Connecticut? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3132.99-3139.84: Gridmock filings and any updates on expected decisions from the commission and timing of investments, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3141.68-3145.03: Thanks for your questions, and I hope you and your family are doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3145.87-3155.84: I mentioned in terms of what items could be additive to our 5 to 7 percent core business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3155.92-3168.93: Growth rate I alluded to, grid mod in Connecticut or New Hampshire or potentially additional AMI dockets in Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3169.53-3177.30: But there's really been no change. All the parties filed comments and plans back in July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3177.86-3187.35: And certainly you can understand there's been a lot going on and I think I may have said East Aeas was in October but we all know that East Aeas was in August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3188.99-3197.52: So since August, there's been a lot of focus on storms and there's been a lot of dockets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3197.86-3205.21: As somebody else mentioned, we have dockets going on in terms of moratoriums and whatnot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3205.43-3214.83: The expectation was there was going to be another go-round and another process in Connecticut towards the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3214.91-3221.56: I really haven't seen anything that would indicate a specific schedule on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3221.62-3234.19: So I guess our best guess is still, you know, it's still in the pipeline and you may see more activity on gridline there in Connecticut as we move over the next several months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3234.51-3244.10: But in terms of being in our forecast, I want to be clear that there is currently no zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3244.20-3248.29: There's no grid-bought spending in our capital forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3248.33-3254.23: For any gridline programs that haven't been approved like in Connecticut or New Hampshire. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3254.85-3262.00: So, you know, once they are approved and once we see what our role would be in them,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3262.18-3268.37: And once we see what that looks like, then we have more confidence in putting it in the plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.17-3274.59: That could be something we have information on by the time we get to the February update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3275.16-3279.46: So, you know, we'll have to stay tuned on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3281.42-3290.63: That makes sense. That's all I had. Thank you guys and stay safe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3292.13-3294.59: Morning. Hi, Jeff. Hi, Phil. Thanks so much for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3297.64-3301.12: A quick follow-up on offshore wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3301.18-3302.92: In light of some of the recent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3302.94-3305.81: I was wondering if that changes how you're... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3305.83-3310.95: Strategizing around other bids that you're putting into future RFPs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3310.97-3318.90: Like baking in more contingency, anything that might give a greater level of comfort around the economic future projects that you might win. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3321.18-3325.49: Thank you Dave for your comment and I hope you and your family are doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3326.61-3333.53: Certainly, every piece of information that you get, and this isn't just offshore wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3333.93-3339.88: This is on all our business, but I'll focus on offshore winds since that's the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3340.74-3359.92: Every month it goes by, every quarter it goes by, we gain more insight and information about construction, about rates, about lots of factors. All of those things are factored into subsequent bids. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3359.98-3365.53: So the information that we have available to us as we're moving into a bid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3365.65-3374.07: Our recent bid in New York is different than we had from bids that we made in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3374.09-3379.10: Every data point is important to us and we factor that into the next bid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3379.12-3393.47: So I say that absolutely that schedules and how you make it through the citing process and all of that informs subsequent bids. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.57-3400.00: I can assure you that all those things get up to the minute attention before it goes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3402.44-3408.41: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And I just wanted to touch on just O&M costs and the O&M budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3408.83-3415.10: Could you remind us how you see that trajectory just for the overall business going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3415.44-3419.86: You've got a great track record of controlling O&M. So what are the key levers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3420.00-3426.43: In your tool belt so that you would focus on going forward for managing O&M. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3429.53-3436.36: We've got people processing technology, right? So all those things are... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3436.38-3442.04: Our leverage to help our capital program as well as our operating program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3442.18-3455.68: We continue to implement systems and technology that improves processes that makes it more efficient and effective workforce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3456.38-3464.40: We have still a robust, I'd say, series of technology improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3464.58-3480.16: I'll start off by just setting the stage. In the guidance we gave, we said that we expected O&M costs to be down this year and then just for the forecast period kind of flat going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3480.86-3483.22: So how are we able to do that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3483.68-3490.23: It is by some of these technology changes and we've been implementing more productivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3490.25-3495.88: Management tools and tools for our individual line workers and gas fitters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3495.90-3500.84: In the field to get their work, to update their work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3500.86-3507.55: That we can then take that and automatically update drawings and files. We don't need to hand it off to somebody. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3508.01-3514.19: So there's still these productivity technology changes that are happening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3514.21-3519.18: Some went in last year, some going in this year, and more planned for next. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3519.44-3531.27: That will be, I'd say, the lever, the underpinning for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and take unneeded costs out of the system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3534.09-3536.04: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks so much for the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3537.02-3538.20: You're welcome. Thank you, David. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3538.92-3546.09: Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Morning, Travis. Good morning. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3546.99-3553.79: Quick clarification on the storm cost, that $275 million number, if I heard you correctly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3554.57-3565.49: How much did you expense in the quarter and how much was either deferred or capitalized or it will be pending that uh... The regulatory filing that you mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3567.53-3580.70: So that amount that you repeated, that's how much of a storm cost that we deferred in both tropical storm Isaias. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3581.08-3586.29: And that was across all states, but primarily in Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3586.69-3594.07: So that's our deferral. That would be, you know, once the storm gets to a certain level, it triggers a deferral. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3594.21-3599.86: So we, that all is deferred storm cost right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3600.08-3601.46: In terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3601.56-3607.63: There are other storms, certainly we had an active quarter for storms in general. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3607.71-3612.95: But there are other storms other than East Zaire that did impact the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3613.27-3622.72: Our storm costs were up about $10 million for the quarter that went through our O&M. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3623.30-3630.85: It's at that level and then the 274 or 5 that you mentioned is the deferred across the system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3632.39-3640.00: Okay great that's that's very helpful thank you and then uh... Quick follow-up to the discussion on the connecticut legislation and there's some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3640.52-3645.99: Language in there is i understood it's about the general assembly having some uh... Review power. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3646.23-3661.44: There what's your thought in terms of the scope of what the General Assembly separate from Pura could do in terms of either taking back some earnings or rate changes stuff like that separate from what's going on in the Pura? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3664.28-3673.49: Well certainly the General Assembly can enact legislation that it feels is appropriate in any matter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3673.91-3683.00: I do think specifically to the energy legislation that was enacted recently in Connecticut. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3683.02-3692.75: Things all were, for the most part, moved to Pura. The regulator, the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3692.83-3703.40: I guess I'd look at it as the legislation would provide the intent, the framework, the direction, and then Pura is the one who's going to be implementing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3703.42-3706.49: You know, they're going to be the ones who evaluate the performance-based rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3706.77-3713.91: They'll be the ones who initiate the storm standards and things like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3713.97-3718.70: And look at should there be penalties, should there be food. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3718.92-3728.03: You know, penalties and things like that. So I think that effectively, you know, the General Assembly can certainly enact a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3728.15-3732.29: Any and all legislation it feels it should. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3732.67-3741.22: And the way that this legislation seems to have turned out was that the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of PURA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3743.22-3751.79: Okay, so the potential for any or the risk for any kind of clawbacks would likely go through PIRA instead of going through the General Assembly based on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3751.81-3754.05: Connecticut legislation that you talked about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3756.68-3757.92: Yeah, as I say, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3757.94-3769.11: The Pura, the dockets are active and will be active over a certain time date that the legislation has given Pura. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3769.37-3775.84: So we expect that Pura will have the pen on this. But again, as I say,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3775.86-3780.52: You know, legislation can always be enacted in any area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3782.00-3784.32: Yeah. OK. Great. Appreciate it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3786.63-3794.05: Thank you, Travis. Our next question is from Andrew Lysel from Scotia. Good morning, Andrew. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3796.74-3798.72: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3800.00-3807.69: First question is with the two rate cases now completed, can you remind us which subsidiaries might be next to file general rate cases? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3807.93-3813.53: We have plenty of regulatory items, of course, with grid mod and other initiatives, but for general rate cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3816.42-3826.03: Well, according to the requirements in Connecticut, Connecticut could be an area that is required to file. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3826.19-3830.15: By the existing framework that's there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3830.21-3836.04: And that would be something that would be sort of a, you know, next year sort of event. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3836.08-3840.42: But other than that, we're pretty much out of the regulatory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3843.50-3853.41: Okay, great. Then on offshore wind, can you share your latest thinking on how big you're willing to let that business get? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3853.85-3859.06: You talked a lot about the opportunities that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3859.66-3866.19: Any thinking as far as from an earnings mix perspective, if there's a limitation or would you plan to just. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3866.21-3870.27: Bid, bid, bid and get as many projects as your leases will support. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3872.35-3876.30: Well, I want to be clear on this because I think it's a very important point that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3876.50-3879.06: Uh... It is a better strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3879.16-3899.86: Our strategy is to have a financial discipline about growing that business in a way that provides appropriate levels of returns that benefit our shareholders. So just by winning a bid doesn't do it. We have to and we continue to maintain financial discipline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3899.94-3905.79: In terms of the amounts that we did and the returns that we're looking for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3906.05-3911.09: As long as the returns are at an appropriate level, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3911.13-3918.68: For that business, it makes sense to make the bid, win the bid, and expand the business there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3920.06-3929.19: The what we said is we are tracks what we own off the coast of what we have access to in terms of the lease areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3929.77-3935.42: You know, we could do about 4,000, at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind. So there's kind of a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3935.92-3944.96: That's the maximum capability that we have, so it's not an infinite growth type of thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3944.99-3953.63: We had indicated that when leases were available that are not in our region that we were not interested in them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3953.73-3964.92: So, MISAs in our region, like the ones we're involved in, are good, but on the lease areas, that's not for us in other parts of the mid-Atlantic, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3965.11-3973.77: We're constrained by the lease area and we're guided by the financial discipline on our bids and our returns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3976.60-3987.03: Got it that's really helpful i guess i should have said bid bid bid responsibly okay well i think that's okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3989.47-3990.57: Andrew, thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3990.79-3992.41: That sort of wraps up today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3993.33-3995.38: If you have any follow-up questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3996.10-4004.88: Please give us a call or send us an email and we look forward to speaking and seeing many of you during the virtual EEI conference next week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4009.55-4014.65: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
