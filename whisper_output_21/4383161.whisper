asr:0: OUTPUT 486.83-492.79: We're continuing to adapt the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 493.23-503.14: In addition, a large portion of our food service customers are also within the QSR segment, which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models.

asr:0: OUTPUT 604.04-608.93: As a result, we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.39-617.96: Beyond driving peer growth, our key customer strategy also promotes trust, enhances long-term relationships, and strengthens our margin structure.

asr:0: OUTPUT 626.05-634.81: A large part of this decrease, 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining closed, partially offset by strength in the retail demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 635.30-641.96: On the other hand, our margin from sales has improved 29%, driven by more favorable price and mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.68-650.13: We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel.

asr:0: OUTPUT 674.49-679.94: This is not surprising considering the mixed simplification due to ongoing labor constraints seen during Q3.

asr:0: OUTPUT 816.10-824.40: The purchase in Mexico experienced some challenges, especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the QSR volume.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.37-1202.94: This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment improves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1203.70-1218.94: Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of bullet placement growth, which is in line with expectations, given that most of the bullet placement increases in 2019 and early to 2020, we're expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.06-1232.19: From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect worker and consumer health. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1233.33-1242.42: Throughout this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.26-1253.05: This new consumer environment favors the retail channel, as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1253.57-1259.40: As a result, retail demands for chicken, like that of all proteins, have remained supported throughout the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1260.00-1263.52: While food service demand still trails below years-ago level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1263.70-1271.19: This channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segment.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1287.63-1296.38: High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a fluid macroenvironment and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will impact the channels differently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.18-1299.72: We expect the restriction of restaurant capacities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1300.00-1312.95: Social distancing guidelines, consumer concern for individual health, and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favoring the increased frequency of at-home meals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1313.75-1322.16: Since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain above year-ago levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1322.78-1329.79: When we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year-ago levels, at least in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.27-1337.82: QSR's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1340.00-1348.15: Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.63-1360.28: While we are already well balanced in terms of our bird size exposure, we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1360.38-1368.79: By increasing the number of different products to key customers, while optimizing our existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.49-1375.74: Our key customer approaches strategic and creates the basis for further accelerated growth in important categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.76-1386.27: By promoting more customized, high-quality, innovative products to give us a clear, long-term, sustainable competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1387.71-1391.07: With that, let's turn to additional details to our financials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.43-1400.46: Our SG&A in the third quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improved the efficiencies of our expenses, but increased support for expanding the Just Bear brand nationally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.86-1407.81: And the investment for our new prepared foods products, both in the U.S. And Mexico, as well as the inclusion of the new assets in Europe.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1429.69-1437.98: Even during these uncertain times, why we continue to evaluate all CAPEX projects and defer those we deem non-essential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1438.36-1449.33: We reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return on capital employee projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for PIVX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.33-1452.39: Our balance sheets continue to be robust.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.39-1475.90: We have no short-term immediate cash requirements, with our bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027 and our terminal maturing in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.20-1485.09: During the quarter, our net debt was $1.9 billion, the lowest since 2016, and a leverage ratio for 2.5 times less 12-month EBITDA.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1550.51-1560.18: To ask a question, you may press Star then 1 on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to minimize background noise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1560.82-1567.61: To withdraw your question, please press star then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.45-1576.54: The first question is from Benjamin Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.36-1586.49: Hi, good morning. How you doing? This is Antonio Hernandez on behalf of Ben Floyd. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.55-1593.09: My question is regarding COVID-19. How is your current level of absenteeism at plans? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1593.13-1598.96: How has that evolved in recent weeks, considering the continuously high number of cases in the U.S.? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.40-1610.41: And also if you can provide some of the kind of a growing rate of protective measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter and what do you see going forward. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.71-1619.06: Yeah, thank you and good morning. First, as we face this global coronavirus pandemic, we have been guided by three principles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1619.84-1623.18: First, a non-compromised commitment to the safety of our team members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1624.14-1636.84: Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country, and of course, endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic upheaval. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1637.42-1643.92: So the direct costs that are related to the extra cleaning in our production in common areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1644.42-1648.13: We also provide the PP&E including the masks and face shields. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.25-1649.73: To all of our team members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1649.95-1658.46: And we install physical barriers in our production area. And of course, we are maintaining social distancing wherever areas we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1658.94-1665.73: We do more than 10,000 barriers within the first 30 days of the pandemic and we continue to upgrade those barriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1666.37-1675.96: We also installed the dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.02-1686.61: As I mentioned, we are offering free live health online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1687.13-1695.46: And above all CDC guidelines, we remove the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreak. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.52-1702.02: And that is creating some challenges to our operations because by removing those people, we have less people at our plants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.22-1705.69: The situation is very fluid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1706.31-1715.62: It varies from plant to plant, but over the last months, we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1716.48-1722.24: So we are already running a much better mix that we were during the Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1723.02-1729.21: And we are seeing a very good increase in our abstentive levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1729.81-1736.42: As people are more familiar with what we are doing as we're gaining the trust of the entire communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.78-1742.24: People are less reluctant to return to work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1742.80-1748.51: And with that, we've been improving our ability to execute the optimal mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1749.43-1755.48: Of course, we're also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1756.02-1765.53: And with the frequent communication with them, we are ensuring they are team members. We expect to return to the optimal operation in this work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.77-1773.37: Thanks a lot. I'm going to work some news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.00-1785.55: With Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning everyone. Morning, Cain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.63-1791.55: Now just two questions, one is as you change your mix, what is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.65-1801.54: What was the mix between big, small, and medium last year and what do you think it's going to be now and what do you think it's going to be a year from now? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1801.56-1803.48: As you adjust your product mixes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1805.43-1810.73: And we are well balanced between small birds, tree pack, and large bird depot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.31-1817.04: What we are doing is, as the demand has been shifting to more retail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1817.24-1821.50: We've been shifting our operations. Also with the growth of QSR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.52-1826.21: We have also adapted to those conditions. What we are doing for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1826.23-1836.40: Is to first move that plant from big birdie boning to small birdie boning, which will increase our presence in that segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.78-1841.44: We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1841.46-1853.11: To comply or support the growth of our key customers and our Just Fair brand, which has doubled the sales in the online channel over this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.09-1863.32: Looking into overall portfolio, we moved from 46% of our total sales in retail to around 51%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1863.34-1866.77: Just in 2020 with small changes in our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.43-1869.17: Or next you expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1869.19-1878.66: 2% increase in that portfolio to the retail, and a 1% to 2% increase in the small board with those two conversions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1881.32-1885.31: My next question is, can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1886.35-1889.95: I did see that there was a little bit of a FX benefit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.37-1897.06: How do you think about the Mexican operation? I think you did say that it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1897.48-1902.34: And how do you think about it for 2021? How do we frame it in our minds? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.34-1904.68: Yeah, sure can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1904.70-1914.63: We've been talking about Mexico over the last year that they are very volatile, quarter over quarter, but they're more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1915.08-1921.28: What happened in the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance between supply and demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1921.36-1925.39: So the industry increased supply during the first semester. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.79-1932.11: And at the same time demand because of the COVID-19 really create a challenging environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1932.49-1936.32: As you remember in Mexico, there was no... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1937.24-1941.98: Support from the government with the COVID-19 like we had in the US and Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1942.18-1945.61: There's no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.83-1951.43: It created a sharp slowdown and recession in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1951.51-1957.52: Which really affected the demand, both in the food service and retail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1957.82-1966.65: While within the US, we saw an increase in retail compensating, at least partially, the shutdown in food service. That didn't happen in Mexico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1966.69-1970.07: And that's why the supply and demand was completely out of balance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1970.69-1973.93: Has the industry adapted their supply? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.95-1980.54: For the Q3 and we at Pilgrims adapted to that situation as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1980.62-1984.00: We reduce our costs and we also cut production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1984.36-1990.55: The supply and demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the food service and demand in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1990.85-1995.44: And now we have very stable prices during this time in Mexico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1996.38-1999.72: We expect this to continue during Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.00-2009.53: Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities. We don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.55-2010.97: The COVID restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.37-2014.05: We've seen some increasing cases in Mexico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2014.95-2023.76: So there could be some more restrictions in the Q4, but given the supply and demand situation that we are in right now, the results are sustainable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2024.16-2031.65: Now, for Q1, we expect the industry to increase production to adequate supply and demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2032.03-2034.17: And the return to more normal levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2035.26-2043.26: Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again, but we expect to be very stable year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2043.36-2048.57: Of course, our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiate products as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2049.01-2056.02: We saw a little bit of impact in the prepared foods, especially on the more affordable products during Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2056.30-2061.86: But we continue to invest and highly differentiate that Pilgrim's products continue to sell really well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2062.32-2071.65: Longer term, despite the volatility, Mexico is a growing economy and as the population increases their disposable income, it leads to a significant growth in protein consumption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.83-2076.96: I really appreciate that answer. Thank you, okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2080.00-2084.60: Our next question is from Ben Bienvenue with Steven Inc. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2086.69-2090.59: Hey, good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2091.41-2107.65: You touched on it in your opening comments with ASF and China and Germany. I want to ask on Germany more specifically. I would think that's a nice boon for the tulip business. Just curious on what you're seeing in that business, both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.73-2110.63: And how you think you're positioned to capture that benefit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2112.35-2116.84: Yeah, thank you, Ben. The operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2117.08-2126.67: So we produce most of our products in UK for the retail UK market. And because of the high welfare, we command a premium in that region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.15-2130.15: The big competition, as you refer,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2130.17-2139.08: Is on the food service sector of imported products from Poland and Germany mainly and Spain on the port side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2140.20-2146.13: Have the Germans have these issues with their production and because of the ban in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2146.15-2151.07: It actually increases the sales in the UK market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2153.09-2157.58: It also created the opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2158.12-2163.96: So what we saw is that on the, what we call fifth quarter products,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.98-2169.97: Significant increase in pricing but on the normal products like loins and others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2170.05-2174.77: We see the price is more stable because it's a zero-sum game at the end of the day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2175.76-2180.62: So it increases the opportunity to China, so that was welcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2181.06-2186.99: I think our sales have, like we mentioned, have doubled during Q3 and we're seeing some very stable pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2187.69-2192.41: But it also includes the competition in the food service segments in UK. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2195.30-2203.64: Okay, great. My second question is related to grain. And apologies if I missed this in your opening comment. I did hear your overview of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.04-2210.43: Could you talk about how you're positioned relative to the markets? Are you more hand-in-mouth at the moment? Do you have any bases secured? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2210.79-2217.32: Any color you could offer there on how you're positioned through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.02-2224.88: Thank you for the question. Obviously, we've seen prices of corn and soybean meal increase in the last few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.25-2235.90: Which has been the result of a few factors. For corn, we've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting 6 million fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2236.44-2242.98: Delta's final stocks for 2019 ended up being 200 million bushels less than was expected when the final counting was done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2243.62-2252.03: On the current crop, we actually, for the acres that are planted, see pretty good yields, above trendline yields, so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of yield production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.67-2257.82: But on the demand side, we've also seen much bigger exports, demand primarily driven by China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2258.20-2266.29: Still, the USDA is projecting a carrier out carry out around 2.1 billion bushels and that includes a 30% increase in export demand from last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.91-2272.81: So even if export demand ends up higher than what USGS is projecting, corn stocks should still be in line with previous years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2273.55-2279.04: Soybeans USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout, which would be the lowest carryout in five years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2279.52-2284.06: This projection, though, includes a 31 percent increase in export demand driven by China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.82-2299.22: In addition to increased export demand, Argentina, which is one of the world's largest oil seed exporting countries, is in the midst of a historic economic crisis that's just causing farmers there to hold back available supplies from the market, adding more pressure to the U.S. To meet this demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2299.86-2307.55: We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about U.S. Soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2307.59-2310.95: Or until South American supplies can be available to meet this demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.77-2320.94: In terms of how we're positioned, we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risk we see, and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2321.42-2325.17: We do recognize the risk to sogon supplies in the US and our positions reflect that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2328.77-2331.41: Thanks and best of luck. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2341.76-2346.59: The next question is from Michael Peikin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.03-2361.02: Yeah, hi. Good morning. I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of, you know, the move, I guess, you know, into retail. And, you know, some of that Big Bird product, is that being chopped up and put into trays? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2361.04-2362.90: And how is that impacting? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.92-2365.31: You know, some of the margins on the commodity business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2367.51-2380.66: Yes, Mike. There's a lot of product from the Big Birds, especially during promotional season, seasonality during the summer, that from the Big Birds end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2381.14-2383.38: We continue to do that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2383.40-2391.25: The challenge to the industry is that we need to have the labor available and the facilities available to do more of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2391.33-2399.58: And that's why the industry has not increased more the production to the tray pack as we want. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.64-2401.66: For as the demand continues to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.18-2407.25: It's also because of that that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2408.09-2417.34: So as of today, yes, we are buying big bar meat and we continue to put it on the tray, especially during Saturdays. And I think the whole industry is doing that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.00-2428.95: Okay, great. And then my second question is, you know, just looking at the, you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to your normal mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2429.21-2431.81: In terms of some of the bones, dark meat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2432.19-2434.99: Do you, are you starting to return that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2435.08-2439.76: What could that mean for the lead quarter prices? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2439.78-2446.69: And the most pressure cannot help or the fact that China is taking more pork cannot help with headquarters that are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2446.75-2449.73: Why haven't white quarter prices moved if there's more to bones? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.15-2456.64: Dark meat potentially being produced and it seems like at the very least China is taking more U.S. Pork. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.52-2465.05: Yes, you're right Mike. Because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2465.27-2473.21: The industry produced 3% more leg quarters in July and August than the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.39-2478.38: Despite a lower total production that put a lot of pressure in the lack of pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2479.50-2483.34: As we are seeing more the reopening of the food service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.88-2492.75: And as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our clients increasing for us and for the whole industry, we are seeing more deboning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2493.03-2499.54: Already at levels comparable to last year in terms of plutonium, which will reduce the pressure in the lag particles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2500.08-2506.37: Of course, China has been also more active in the lag quarter market over the last month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.77-2510.17: And we're seeing that in the blackwater inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.41-2516.34: That was up on a on a sequential basis up to August, but we are seeing a reduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.70-2523.38: And also the inventory today is down 9% compared to the peak Q1 average that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2523.44-2531.69: So those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the light water production, which is a commodity item, as I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2531.97-2534.11: And the China interest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2534.19-2546.53: I think we saw over the last weeks, although not today, the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in the dollar, which increased the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.55-2554.27: Availability of dollars from the developing countries which also increases the demand for black water. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.43-2561.62: So what could help on the left quarter going forward is both on supply and demand. On supply is exactly what you said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2561.64-2565.93: Left leg quarters because of the improvement in labour efficiencies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.95-2576.42: And the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand because of low prices and because of more affable income in the developing economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2587.07-2591.25: The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2593.55-2595.76: Thanks for taking the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2597.58-2607.15: Fabio, as I'm thinking about it, the small bird and resale channels obviously have been tremendously profitable for you guys during this time period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2607.93-2616.24: And with the plant conversion coming. But with commodity Big Bird remaining in the cutoff value you have here, remaining under such pressure,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2616.36-2622.46: Just at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2623.28-2635.68: Whether that's to retail or to small bird, because it just seems like that big bird portion is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or taking out of the market in some capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2637.80-2642.48: I think the decision to convert the plan is a more long-term decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2642.98-2647.61: And we always make those decisions combined with our key customer strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2647.73-2655.30: As we see the demand of these key customers growing, we take action in our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2655.48-2664.97: And that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2665.35-2673.91: I think, again, you need to look into a more broader, long-term perspective. We continue to expect the food service sector to rebound. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2674.51-2676.90: If you look at the food service sector,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2677.14-2684.74: Today the food service restaurants are down 13% year over year and that is impacting the big party voting for sure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.17-2687.73: While the QFRs are up 9%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2688.53-2692.77: As we go to a more normal operations, as we see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2692.87-2699.12: Maybe the development of vaccines, we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2699.40-2710.45: We expect the food service restaurants, especially on the full service, to regain some market share that they are not operating today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.57-2712.99: So I think it's a long-term decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2713.55-2721.20: It's also a very difficult decision to move from Big Bird to a smaller, because we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2721.26-2726.15: And we have the feed mills, it's all built to that specific burden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2726.33-2733.17: Our plants in the United States are really customized to that specific segment. So any conversion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.81-2742.66: It really requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2742.68-2746.03: Both starting from the growers, your feed mills,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2746.05-2747.51: And your field operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.07-2753.65: So it's a high capital investment that needs to be supported for the long run. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2753.91-2757.66: So that's why we don't see a lot of conversions in our industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2757.92-2765.63: Of course, if this situation continues for a longer period of time, you can see some conversions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2766.57-2779.58: I think also it's important to know that some other players don't have the key customer relationships that we have. And moving from the big bird to the small bird or to the case ready require a customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2780.02-2782.74: And a key customer to support. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2783.34-2788.35: And since they don't have those relationships, it's harder for them to do some convergence. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2790.77-2799.82: No, that's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up, given where the balance sheet is now and something you talked about in your prepared remarks,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2801.18-2811.05: How should we think about M&A potential, maybe from a geographic perspective? Or does it make sense to get bigger in pork in Europe and going into 2021? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2811.77-2818.14: Just any help there and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your CFO search. Thanks very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2819.88-2822.86: In terms of strategy, I think our strategy continues the same. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2823.08-2832.13: And our growth strategy continues intact and as I mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet. We look into increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2832.21-2837.84: To create a more balanced portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2837.88-2844.68: And we're also looking for chicken assets where we can extract more value from operational efficiencies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2845.39-2852.57: We are seeing targets both in the U.S. And outside the U.S., geographical diversification and to growth in Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2853.15-2857.86: And we will evaluate all alternatives to our value creation standards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2859.06-2863.80: In terms of the CFO, we are in the process of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2863.82-2869.47: Finding another CFO, we already engage recruiting firms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2869.85-2872.77: And we should have some news in the near future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2874.91-2881.62: Great, thanks very much guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2881.64-2885.11: Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs & Co. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2886.57-2889.49: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2890.67-2895.54: So, maybe first just a clarification or a little more detail on the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2895.66-2903.00: Of the Minnesota plant for case ready and the conversion of the Texas plant to small bird from big bird. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2904.44-2911.37: What's the net impact on your production volume and what's the capital cost of those projects? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2912.83-2917.14: Yeah, in terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2917.26-2926.43: We expect to grow in line with USDA expectations and the industry for 2021, which is a little bit lower than 1%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.99-2930.57: As we have more birds in Minnesota,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2930.89-2937.50: But we also reduce the weight in our operation on the big bird that we are transforming to a small bird. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2937.58-2942.36: So we expect to be for 2021 in line with those two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2942.78-2948.49: In terms of investment, it's not very significant to our total capex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2949.61-2952.41: As the conversion of the small bear plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2952.79-2956.22: It's not, it's a simpler conversion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2956.84-2963.56: Of course, that QSR requires some DSIs, which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2963.60-2972.61: And we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well. Today is a manual deboning operation and we're going to invest in automated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2973.21-2977.62: The investment is close to $20 to $25 million in that operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2978.10-2979.80: And in the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2979.84-2988.43: In the case of the case value operation, it's close to $70 million. So overall, it is a total of $100 million that we're going to invest in those two conversions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2989.81-2999.76: Okay, that's a tough call there. And the follow-up was I just want to make sure I heard something right from the prepared remarks. He talks about the prepared food business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3000.00-3004.44: In the U.S. Declining 26 percent, I think is what I heard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3005.35-3012.61: I'm hoping to expand on that. That's a business that I think has had a few more challenges over the years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3013.85-3021.76: Is it really just a question of return to school and food service traffic, or how do we think about that business or margin profile moving forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3022.66-3024.74: Yeah, that's exactly it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3024.97-3032.59: In our prepared food business we have a strong brand which is the Pierce brand that is mainly a food service brand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3032.65-3037.20: We also are very strong in the school with our Gold Kiss brand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3037.56-3042.96: Both those segments are the ones that are most affected by the COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3043.34-3052.75: The non-commercial food service that includes schools were down 66% at Q2 and now they are down 43%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3052.95-3059.36: We are seeing some school reopens which could help, but it's a segment that is still down 40%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3059.94-3068.13: On what we call the commercial food service, which is a street business where our Pierce brand is a leading brand in wings and in chunks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3068.55-3075.92: We saw that in Q2, they end up 36% lower than the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3076.10-3083.30: But they're rebounding and then today they are close to 4% lower than the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3083.32-3088.97: The food service business has been recovering and with that our peers brand has. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3088.99-3090.99: Recover in our volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3091.13-3098.00: But the school system is still close to 40% lower than the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3098.48-3102.78: And that's why we're investing in more retail branded business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3103.32-3108.31: As we mentioned, our Pilkings brand has increased more than 30%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3108.65-3118.40: And we have been very successful in expanding the Just Bear brand from the fresh category, which has been very successful on the online segment and also on the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3118.42-3123.50: On the higher attribute segment in our key customers to the prepared food segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3126.65-3129.15: All right, great. That's a helpful call. I'll pass it on. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3132.97-3137.94: The next question comes from Carla Casella with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3139.70-3141.78: Hi, my question is regarding your leverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3142.28-3151.87: The three times target, how comfortable or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional MNA? And are you seeing any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3151.91-3156.52: More M&A opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3160.00-3165.77: We set this target of two to three times because it's the best capital structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3165.89-3170.05: That can protect and reduce our interest payments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3170.13-3176.32: Well, not creating any problem for our bonds and for our leverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3177.74-3182.28: The 2-3 times within normal operations, of course during some acquisitions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3182.36-3188.45: If we have a great plan on how to reduce that back, we can go further. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3189.33-3198.18: I don't think there is a number that is specific on where we go. I think it's more about what is the plan to be leveraged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3198.30-3202.10: And of course, the plan to do leverage could include. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3202.12-3209.47: The issue of stock. And that's why Pilgrims as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3209.73-3219.24: Not to increase the leverage to points where we don't think it is prudent in the case of significant acquisition that would be transformational for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3222.12-3224.82: Sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3224.97-3230.59: In terms of M&A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the whole situation about traveling has... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3230.61-3235.34: Created some challenges in terms of seeing and visiting assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3235.42-3244.48: But we are seeing some targets that are still very interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3248.45-3254.71: In the event that JBS is able to list the U.S. Census, would that cause any need for a change in your structure? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3256.42-3265.69: Yeah, we don't believe so. I think JBS has said many times that they continue to support Pym's to be a public traded company, just as I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3266.05-3269.63: It is a great way for us to keep our growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.77-3276.82: We can use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important and transformational event for payments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3280.14-3285.91: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3285.93-3293.97: If you have a question, please press star and 1 on your telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3294.03-3300.00: There are no more questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fabio Sandri for closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3301.86-3310.25: Well, thank you all. We would like to reiterate our continued commitment to our valued team members to provide them with a safe and healthy work environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3310.37-3314.55: While supporting our duty to maintain food production and supply to customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3315.28-3319.90: We are looking forward to closing 2020 with good results in spite of the volatility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3320.36-3328.23: Our diverse portfolio of differentiated products tailored to support our key customer strategy in conjunction with our broad geographic footprint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3328.31-3336.18: Will continue to generate consistent performance and minimize margin volatility in challenging marketing conditions relative to competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3336.62-3344.92: We will continue to seek new growth potential, both organically and through acquisitions, while offering even more differentiated products portfolio within our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3344.94-3349.47: To support key customers' needs by cultivating a culture of constant innovation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3350.21-3357.56: We would like to thank everyone in the Pugin's family, including our family farm partners, suppliers, and our customers who make our business possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3357.92-3362.40: As always, we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you for joining us today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3367.59-3373.35: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
