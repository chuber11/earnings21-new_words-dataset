asr:0: OUTPUT 421.78-431.49: Our global e-commerce business once again delivered strong performance in the third quarter, while as expected, our outfitter business remained challenged as a result of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 432.41-439.68: We continue to make great progress on the strategies we have outlined while leveraging our strong foundation to advance our growth initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 441.26-448.27: Total revenue increased 5.9% to $360 million compared to $340 million last year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 465.65-473.49: During the quarter we saw strength in a number of our categories including fleece, sleepwear, loungewear, and knits, as well as in our home business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 474.85-484.18: With many consumers still working from home, these categories deliver double digit growth in the quarter as our marketing strategies emphasize the comfort and value in our product assortments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 485.77-494.53: Partially offsetting the strong global e-commerce growth, sales in our outfitter business were down 26% due to ongoing pressure as a result of COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 495.46-504.96: The Outfitters results reflect overall sequential improvement versus last quarter, although our travel-related national accounts and our small and mid-sized businesses remain challenged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 505.77-512.03: The most significant improvement came in our school uniform business where sales were approximately flat to last year for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.03-518.56: Overall, we expect performance in this business to remain choppy with the recent spike in the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 520.28-525.93: Moving to our retail business, sales decreased approximately 44% in the third quarter to $8 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 526.51-532.83: This decrease was driven by lower traffic due to the pandemic, partially offset by improved conversion in our stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 534.47-539.30: Gross margin in the third quarter increased approximately 10 basis points to 45.4%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 539.32-545.97: As compared to last year, gross margin benefited from our improved promotional strategies and continued use of analytics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 546.63-553.65: This was partially offset by higher shipping costs and surcharges, as well as sales mix from our growing third-party business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 555.18-559.62: As a percentage of sales as GNA improved by approximately 230 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.04-565.49: To 37.5% compared to 39.8% in the third quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 566.75-573.73: This improvement is a result of increased sales combined with continued discipline expense management across our entire business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 575.66-580.22: Income tax expense was $2.8 million compared to an expense of $1.3 million last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.20-590.39: Net income for the quarter was $7.2 million or $0.22 per share compared to net income of $3.6 million or $0.11 per share last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 592.39-598.56: In addition to these gap measures, adjusted EBITDA is an important profit building measure that we use to manage our business internally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 599.80-609.63: For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $28.6 million, which is approximately a 52% increase versus last year adjusted EBITDA of $18.8 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 611.33-617.54: Turning to the balance sheet, inventories at the end of the quarter were $499.8 million, roughly flat to a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.68-626.23: The strong sell-through of our global e-commerce business has positioned us with healthy and lean inventories as we head into the holiday season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 627.51-630.83: Inventory levels related to our outfitter business are elevated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 631.33-638.50: Although this is not seasonal or fashion product, so we expect to work through this merchandise as the business environment improves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.50-644.32: During the third quarter, we secured a new term loan of $275 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 645.11-654.51: The loan proceeds combined with borrowings under the company's ABL facility were used to refinance our prior term loan, which was due in April of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 655.70-665.59: Upon the closing of the refinancing, maximum availability under the ABL facility was expanded by $75 million to $275 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 666.93-673.65: The new term loan extends our debt duration and further enhances our strong liquidity position with a more flexible balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 675.48-684.26: Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect net revenue to be between $500 and $520 million driven by our global e-commerce business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 685.04-690.63: As a reminder, last year's results include approximately 40 million from our American Airlines launch. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 691.71-701.50: After adjusting for the American Airlines launch, expected net revenue for the quarter would be between a 2% decrease and a 2% increase versus prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 702.94-711.61: We expect net income of $13.5 to $17.5 million and diluted earnings per share to be between $0.41 and $0.53. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.87-717.22: We expect the Chesed EBITDA to be in the range of $38 to $43 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.38-725.11: And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jerome to discuss the progress on our core growth strategies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 726.63-727.63: Thanks, Jim. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 727.65-738.02: Despite the continued uncertainty related to COVID, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our business effectively and deliver meaningful EBITDA growth during a very difficult environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 738.76-749.69: We remain focused on driving market share gains through continuously enhancing our engagement with existing customers and gaining market share through our own channel as well as through new partnerships and collaborations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.83-753.13: Our four core growth strategies remain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 753.41-762.56: Getting the product right, being a digitally driven company, implementing a unit channel distribution strategy, and enhancing our infrastructure and processes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 763.60-771.35: As previously mentioned, we're very pleased with the response to our product offering in the quarter. As we head into the holiday season, it will be an important time for gift giving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 771.89-775.44: Our key item strategy will focus on sleepwear, outerwear, and home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 776.22-784.58: Within these categories, since holiday is an important time for family, we plan to emphasize whole house family messaging, specifically with regards to patterns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 785.33-790.49: Our Let's Get Comfy theme, highly relevant in today's environment, will remain the focus of our messaging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 791.29-798.60: Within digital, we continue to see incredible opportunity to drive traffic and market share as we refine our search engine optimization techniques. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.32-807.85: Our holiday promotional and markdown strategy, we'll continue to leverage data analytics and machine learning to effectively determine optimal prices for our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.63-817.60: As a result, we expect lower markdowns and higher product margin rates than previous years, despite the highly promotional environment and incremental shipping expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.48-825.93: As we advance our data analytics capabilities from quarter to quarter, we will continue to gain further knowledge of customer behavior trends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 827.03-832.79: Turning to our retail business, we continue to monitor retail trends to evaluate a post-pandemic store strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.23-840.24: However, with the current rising cases of COVID-19, our priority right now is the health and safety of our associates and customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 841.46-851.09: Turning to our more recent growth initiatives beyond our own channels, we're very pleased to see the strong response to Land and Brand on both Kohl's.com and in the 150 launched stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 851.81-857.22: The product is resonating with customers and we will be expanding our assortment within these doors and Kohl's.com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 857.94-862.48: In addition, we plan to double our door count with coals to 300 in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.58-871.81: We remain confident that this is a great opportunity to expand our reach given the Kohl's customer profile shares the same demographic features as the Lansdyn customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 873.45-882.78: In our Outfitters business, our long-term strategy is to focus on our personalization capabilities, which we believe will attract new customers as well as serve the needs of existing customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 883.60-890.39: We plan to implement enhancements to our business outfitter site to leverage some of the improvements we have implemented on our consumer website. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 891.13-895.84: While we're in the early stages, we believe this will support longer term growth in our outfitters business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 896.74-905.39: With regard to the land and marketplace, we now have 13 third-party vendors selling product on our website, and we are seeing initial results in line with our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 906.03-910.35: Our goal is to reach 20 to 25 third-party vendors selling product by year end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 911.69-918.06: Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to update you on our initiatives around diversity and inclusion within our organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 918.08-921.92: As this remains of significant importance to us as an organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.84-929.81: First, we have established a diversity and inclusion council consisting of members of our organization who come from diverse backgrounds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.83-933.67: And will work to create programming and goals for our company to work towards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 934.29-943.74: To that end, the council has established both training modules and the speaker series that are, respectively, required of and open to all of our employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.34-949.61: We have also established business resource groups to provide support for our employees with shared experiences. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 950.45-958.96: We want all of our employees to feel they have a voice and the support they need to utilize it. Our journey has just begun, but we're committed to learning and improving every day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.88-963.76: In conclusion, we're incredibly energized by the strong momentum in our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.96-972.99: We recognize the uncertainty in the environment and it may extend for a period of time creating both challenges and opportunities. And we will manage our business accordingly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.67-983.56: The strong foundation we put in place and the progress we continue to make on our strategic initiatives give us great confidence in our ability to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 983.58-985.39: As we drive growth in our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 986.05-988.85: We look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 989.17-996.38: And with that, we'll open it up to questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1000.00-1004.14: Telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1007.01-1012.87: Our first question comes from the line of Alex Furman with Craig Halum. Your line is now open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1014.91-1019.18: Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1019.84-1029.27: I wanted to ask about what you've been seeing so far. It sounds like the unseasonably warm weather has had a little bit of an impact on your outerwear business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1029.71-1034.03: Anything to call out now that we're just on the other side of Thanksgiving weekend? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1034.05-1043.14: About how your brands perform during Black Friday and through Cyber Monday. Anything notable to call out there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1043.68-1052.83: Hey Alex, thanks for the question. I think like everybody else, we're seeing a shift in consumer behavior this holiday season with obviously an emphasis on online shopping. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.47-1057.78: Black Friday itself was a positive day for us, both domestically and internationally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1057.84-1067.25: We saw solid growth in our business year over year. And we're pretty encouraged by the continued resilience and performance of our global e-commerce business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.93-1073.49: But the fourth quarter got off to a slower start in the US particularly due to our heavy outerwear category. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.55-1081.06: I don't like to bring up weather. I always think weather is kind of a cheap excuse, but I think as everybody knows, cold weather hasn't really started yet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.44-1088.47: And if you couple that with people staying home and indoors and not commuting because of COVID, the demand for heavy outerwear just isn't there yet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.09-1098.74: But if you look at our other categories, as you would expect, our other categories are performing well. Same categories in third quarter going into the fourth quarter that people have had good demand for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1101.06-1107.47: That's really helpful. Thanks. It sounds like you guys are acquiring a lot of new customers here, or at least did in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1108.07-1115.18: Where has that been coming from? Has there been any particular marketing channel that's been effective or new products that have been bringing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.20-1120.70: New customers in or has that just been kind of a continuation of the efforts that you've been putting in place for a while now? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1121.60-1129.65: It's a bit of a mix. I mean, obviously search has always been the lion's share of where we have new customers coming in from a marketing standpoint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.05-1138.84: But what we've seen is that a couple of other areas are performing super well for us, even though we put smaller dollars into them. Social media has been doing really well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1139.26-1144.32: And we've got some video out on Connected TV, which seems to be doing a pretty good job for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1145.29-1153.97: A couple of that with big increases in knitwear, loungewear, activewear, which is bringing in a lot of newer customers for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1154.29-1159.92: And those customers tend to be on the younger side from where our existing customer base is. So that looks pretty good for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1162.64-1164.18: That's helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1164.32-1173.55: And then lastly, if I could just ask, on the outfitters side of the business, I mean, obviously that's pretty closely impacted by the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1173.63-1179.78: Just curious, you work with a lot of the biggest companies out there in retail and transportation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1179.92-1186.35: What's the outlook for next year? At what point do you think things are going to start turning around for some of your big customers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1189.09-1196.00: I think that what you're going to see is a longer fallback in any of the travel related products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1196.86-1199.10: Anybody who's really related to travel right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1199.36-1201.88: We're seeing increases, albeit small increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.16-1212.01: I think where we're really going to be concentrating in the Outfitters business is going to be on the small and mid-sized businesses and making their customer experience easier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.05-1214.27: We think that there's a big opportunity for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1214.29-1224.98: To improve the customer experience online of getting your product logo or getting your product customized in multiple ways and making that an easier process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1225.01-1227.15: And easier customer experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1227.69-1231.29: And we're going to see a lot of concentration in that part of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1232.59-1243.38: You know, Alex, I think you touched on that as far as the outfitters. It's really three different businesses. If you remember, it's about one-third school, one-third small and mid-sized business, and one-third the large national accounts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1244.14-1248.47: So Jerome mentioned that the large national accounts is probably going to be the slowest recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.19-1255.84: We're very excited to see the sequential improvement that we mentioned in the school business, and that business was actually fairly flat for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1258.92-1261.10: That's great. Well, thanks very much, both of you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.07-1273.47: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Morata with CL King & Associates. Your line is now open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1274.55-1278.62: Good morning, Jerome and Jim. Congratulations on the third quarter as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1279.02-1285.03: As far as, Jerome, you just touched on it as it relates to staying at home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1285.05-1290.79: For outerwear. Assuming we get a relatively normal winter season from this moment forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1291.11-1299.08: Could there still be a negative impact on that category just because people aren't going out as much? And if so, how do you quantify that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.72-1309.49: I think, Steve, from what we put out with guidance, we've taken that into account for what we think will be happening over the course of the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.83-1314.35: As you know, the cold weather is really in front of us, not behind us based upon the date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1314.89-1320.00: So far, so, I think we've taken that into account in the guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.64-1328.55: I think as far as a quantification, Steve, to Jerome's point, it's in the guidance. I think the other thing we feel really good about, and we mentioned this, because we had such a healthy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1328.57-1331.61: Back into the second quarter and the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1331.63-1338.04: Our inventory positions are so healthy and so lean that even though we might have a little bit of a challenge in some of the heavy outerwear,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1338.48-1340.78: We don't think there's a lasting impact there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.40-1345.95: Gotcha. Do you comment international commerce was up really, really well? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1345.99-1355.10: Can you comment on the tactics that help that? What is that as a percent of sales right now? And how can you capitalize on that segment of the business going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.46-1370.47: I think a lot of the things that I work in there internationally are a lot of the things that you hear us doing on the U.S. Side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.37-1378.08: So many of those things we've been doing for the last several quarters share from what we've been doing from a digital perspective from what we've been doing from a data link. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1378.10-1382.42: Analytics perspective from what we've been doing with capturing new customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.02-1389.05: We're now rolling many of those things out, especially in Europe, and we've really seen significant positive impacts there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.31-1393.65: How big a percent of the sales was that in the third quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1395.14-1397.86: I don't think we give that as a specific number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.68-1402.92: But I think you can go back to history and do some of the math. Obviously, it continues to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1403.42-1413.41: The overall global e-commerce business is now probably up over 80% as a percent of our total with some of the challenges in the outfitter business and that continued growth on the e-commerce side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1414.43-1419.20: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. I'll take the rest of my questions offline. Thank you. Thanks, Steve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.34-1424.42: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.51-1431.79: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
