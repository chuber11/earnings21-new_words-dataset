asr:0: OUTPUT 67.69-74.41: They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 75.16-78.06: Actual results may differ materially from projected results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 78.98-83.68: Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 83.70-89.49: Are included in our press releases yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 90.49-93.47: We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 93.89-99.38: Our second quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's Form 8K filing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 99.92-108.21: As well as our commentary on the quarter posted to our website, also contain information important on these non-GAAP measures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 109.41-118.80: Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jack. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with very brief comments, then we'll get straight on to your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 119.60-123.46: This was a very good quarter for Montaigne and our momentum is increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 123.82-126.01: The key points about a performance are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 126.23-132.73: Our cash flow generation this quarter is the result of the past five years of work by our team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 132.75-136.38: To transform our cost structure and strengthen our franchise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.80-139.20: We're succeeding even earlier than we expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 139.54-144.08: We've already achieved five of our seven 2021 cost targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.99-153.91: Even with realized PODF prices down $20 per ton from the first quarter and realized FOSA prices up just $13 per ton in the quarter,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 153.93-157.16: We generated over 800 million in cash from operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 157.66-165.59: We delivered adjusted EBITDA 25% higher than consensus expectations, even before our adjusted EBITDA definition changed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 166.17-175.92: We paid down $500 million in short-term debt and structured payables in the quarter while retaining cash on the balance sheet above $1 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 176.38-185.61: In Potash, we continue to invest in the accelerated K3 project, hitting a major milestone of connecting the K3 shafts to the K1 mill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 186.07-193.47: We continue to reduce our brine management costs and we achieve the lowest cash cost per ton of production in over a decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 194.37-203.42: Mose Pridlazante had an excellent quarter, hitting both Rial-based cost targets and achieving further cost benefits from the weakening Rial. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 204.20-209.45: As well as realizing over 80% of our targeted full year transformation benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 210.07-218.68: Phosphates drove the cash costs of rock below the target and lower than last year despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.52-228.39: And with all of these efforts, we've reaffirmed our commitment to you, to our shareholders, our employees, our customers, and our communities to act responsibly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 228.81-237.44: We announced new, aggressive, broad-based environmental, social, and governance targets, and we will use these targets to drive performance across the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 238.56-248.49: We are continuing to transform. The quarters, accelerating earnings, and cash flow clearly reflect our efforts to date, and we are driving additional future savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 249.17-257.10: We expect to deliver another $700 million in savings above the 2019 base as we continue to execute our strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.70-265.43: Mosaic is more competitive than ever before, and with fertilizer markets improving, we have significant earnings leverage to the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 266.31-268.41: Now, we'll take your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 269.85-272.89: I'm going to start with some questions we received on call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 274.17-282.74: Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs asked, in the second quarter, Mosaic was ahead of its 2021 targets and a number of the key cost KPIs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 283.44-288.09: How much incremental opportunity do you see on each key metric to further reduce costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 288.65-293.75: And if so, what level of incremental capital spend would be necessary to achieve those outcomes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 295.34-296.72: Thanks for your question, Adam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 296.92-305.73: As we've said earlier, we have new targets that include $700 million of additional improvements across the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 306.09-313.85: 200 million of those coming from our Brazil operation and 500 coming from our North American and administrative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 314.57-323.18: Some of the areas where we believe we can make big gains as we go forward, obviously, are in Brazil, where we continue to improve that business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 323.70-330.75: In North America where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both phosphates and potash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 331.23-340.82: And then of course our K3 operation, which as we ramp it up will eliminate a lot of costs and improve our brine management costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 341.22-345.09: So as we look forward, we see a lot of opportunities still. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 345.33-349.07: And importantly, in September when we bring our... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 349.09-356.74: All of this to our analysts today, we expect to be able to give you more color and detail on what that's going to look like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 360.34-363.08: Jack, Chris Parkinson from Credit Swift asks... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 363.76-369.67: You're clearly comfortably ahead on numerous cost initiatives, including your K3 shaft, Brine Info. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 370.29-373.79: Phosphate rock costs in the U.S. And Brazil, and for the Lasanches platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 374.23-375.80: But would you take a step back? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 376.10-384.56: How are you thinking about your structural cost base in a normalized environment? And how much more could actually be done, especially in phosphate? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 386.53-387.57: Yeah, thank you, Chris. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 388.23-399.06: It's important to keep in mind that these cost improvements certainly are somewhat driven by high utilization. We've had a good quarter where we're able to use our assets fully. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 399.84-406.31: And we've had some benefits from exchange rate, particularly in Brazil, but also in Canada. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 406.81-415.66: Over the long term though, the real differences have been structural and those are going to stay with us and those are going to continue and we're going to continue to improve those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 416.20-424.14: So if we look at our major projects, which include Esterhazy K3, NextGen Mining, and the Brazil transformation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 424.44-431.55: Those are not temporary differences. Those are true structural changes that will be delivering value for the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 434.09-436.88: Doc, Michael Piken from Cleveland Research asks... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 437.76-442.92: You mentioned that you were on track to exceed your $225 million in non-market growth in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 443.68-449.45: Which segments are exceeding your expectations and how much higher can this number go for 2020? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 451.49-460.86: Hello, Michael, let me clarify our $225 million were actual items that we spent in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 460.92-463.86: That we did not expect to repeat in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 464.24-471.91: So on those, some of the key items, the plant city idling, that's happened and now is outside of our cost structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 472.47-479.32: Are Brazilian dams. We've completed the work now and that $80 million of cost is now behind us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 479.88-484.92: Equally the ramp up of estrohazine which has gotten better than we expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 485.15-493.41: We now are delivering 1 million tons a year from the K3 project, so that benefit has already flowed through to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 493.79-499.72: And then of our $50 million of transformation in Brazil, we're part of that $225 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 499.84-502.28: We're already at over 40 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.48-510.63: We see that as pretty much complete and ongoing savings will be above and beyond that original 225 we talked about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.75-519.08: Shots the largest number of questions, seek a better understanding of our countervailing duties petition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 520.00-524.50: Jeff Goldstein from Morningside, Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 524.72-531.09: Ask for an update on potential regulation changes of the U.S. Import duties on Morocco and Russian supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 531.63-538.72: And if the outcome is successful in our favor, what should they expect in changes to their landed U.S. Costs? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 539.02-543.76: In other words, what are the potential outcomes in terms of leveling the playing field? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 545.15-550.13: Thank you, gentlemen. Let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.93-559.56: However, the reason we filed this petition in the first place was to address imbalances associated with unfair government subsidies on imports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.78-563.10: And to highlight unequal requirements on environmental standards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 563.34-572.25: We believe our competitors benefit from access to artificially low rock costs and energy while not having to meet adequate and proper environmental standards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.79-575.10: We also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 575.12-583.30: We'll say that what we have done is put this forward to the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 583.36-594.67: They will judge on the merits and as such determine what level of duties, if any, need to be put in place to create a fair trade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 594.69-595.80: Situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 598.34-600.60: And Quint, do you have anything to add to that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 602.16-611.07: No, Jock, I think you're right. We certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the $225 million in non-market benefit this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 611.43-617.68: Keep in mind that the $80 million that we spent on BAMR mediation last year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.70-628.27: Would spread really through the second through fourth quarter. So we realized about $36 million in benefit in the second quarter and should realize the balance throughout the rest of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 630.69-633.27: Dr. John Roberts from UBS would like to know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 633.71-641.28: Can you review the basis for your Foster Aid Countervailing Duties position? And have you had any response from customers or competitors? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 644.92-646.27: Thank you, John. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.37-658.40: Our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents and I would ask that you go to those. Also the comments from any of our competitors or... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 658.42-661.08: Customers or other. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 661.10-667.75: Concerned groups is clearly laid out in those public documents. So I would suggest you go there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 667.97-677.94: Our position is clearly that the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission really are the ones that will decide what are the merits of this case. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 678.74-685.91: Now clearly, as we talk to our customers, some are concerned mostly about how they're going to get their supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.17-694.39: We believe that this has opened up new opportunities for outside competitors to come in and make up some of that supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 695.80-704.80: But in the end, I think all people understand why we put it forward and we'll have to wait to see what the ITC says in terms of its merits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 707.45-712.15: We received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.35-714.61: Specifically Adam Samuelson and seven others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 715.03-716.18: Over the next... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 716.20-725.13: Six to 12 months, how do we think about the net impact of potential trade flow impacts of potential US countervailing duties on Morocco and Russian phosphate? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 725.85-732.25: Do you see risk of market share competition rising in other major import markets, notably Brazil? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 733.95-741.22: Thanks Mike and Joel. Let's answer their last question first. No, we don't think this will impact global supply and demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 742.06-744.82: All we will do is probably change trade flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.35-750.79: The current market and resulting pricing is reflective of a tight market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 751.29-758.04: And if anything, the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this market was tight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 758.80-766.67: So what's causing the tight market? Favorable farm economics and lower supply, which began to take shape well before we filed the petition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.47-774.49: However, it is reasonable to assume that the trade flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 774.51-779.68: Including new suppliers coming into the US and the Moroccan and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.70-786.25: Russian suppliers focusing on other markets which could be Brazil or wherever. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 790.75-795.64: Jonas Oskard from Bernstein asked two more technical questions with respect to the petition, namely... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 796.26-805.31: If the Mosaic Trade Complaint is upheld, will there be a retroactive benefit to Mosaic? And what is the timeline for final decision on the complaint? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.01-810.77: So thank you, Jonas. Let me first clarify. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 810.93-813.31: Whether duties are applied retroactively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 813.33-821.74: Will depend upon the level of imports from these two countries from the filing of the case until the DOC preliminary ruling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 822.12-826.37: We expect the case to be finalized in Q1 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 827.37-835.22: And at that point, if there has been excessive imports, they will look at assessing a retroactive duty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 836.80-843.84: I'm now going to move on to questions about phosphate operations. Ben Isaacson from Scotia asks,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 845.13-851.95: On the cash cost of mine rock in Florida falling to $36 per ton from $40 year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 852.51-862.12: How much of that was due to transformational efforts versus favorable geology? And how much more wiggle room is there to bring that down? And how sustainable are these cost improvements? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 864.44-870.05: Thank you, Ben. Clearly, our cost improvements are a combination of several factors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 870.41-875.38: We've certainly been running our assets at an elevated utilization rate, and that's helped. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 876.00-883.34: But our efforts to centralize mining operations, streamline processes, and automate have also helped reduce our costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 883.60-900.02: As previously mentioned, the establishment of a central control center for our mining and collapsing all of our mining operations basically into one large operation, which should begin operation by the end of the year, will really further enhance cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 900.60-907.67: And as we introduce new management structures, incorporate automation for certain mining functions and Excel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 907.73-915.48: Accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation, we start to see real long-term improvements in our cost structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 918.04-924.88: T.J. Juvicar from Citi also asked, with the recent rise of over $50 per ton in DAP pricing,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 925.47-932.83: Have you ramped up your production at the mine? And what could be the benefit of better cost absorption from higher times in the third quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 935.74-939.72: Thanks for the question, PJ. High utilization rates have a beneficial impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.22-942.80: But that's really only part of the story, as we've mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 943.24-953.13: But I will say that as we look at Q3 going forward, we can expect those high tonnage and high utilization rates to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 953.67-960.78: So we do expect to see better costs throughout the rest of the year, both structurally and because of high utilization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.06-966.59: We also have a question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 967.91-973.83: The specialty percentage rose to 48% of shipments and marked a new quarterly high in phosphate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 974.23-978.82: Coincident with micro central shipments to firms being substantially above recent quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 979.74-982.42: Is this sustainable? Why or why not? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 984.44-993.13: Thank you, Adam. The sales of MicroEssentials and Aspire hit record highs and KMAG came in close to the record in quarter two, 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.87-999.34: Among these growth, microcentral shipments to Brazil has been a major driver. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1000.02-1007.23: Now we believe that the growth of microessentials will continue over the next quarter driven by mosaic, turtle, and also North America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1007.81-1012.15: I have to reemphasize the value that microessentials brings to the growers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1012.17-1018.52: Is showing positive returns for them on their investments. So these are bringing real value to the growers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1018.54-1020.94: And to our customers, the distributors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.18-1031.07: So we do believe that as more people start using micro-essentials, this is very sustainable and they're going to see the benefits and they're going to keep using that product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1032.43-1040.20: Just ask three analysts submitted multi-part questions related to our potash operations. So first, Chris Parkinson's asks,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1041.28-1047.59: The demand environment in Potash appears to be modestly improving while spot prices are well off their first half lows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1047.71-1057.68: Can you talk about your thought process for the second half of 21 operating rate assumptions and how that may drive changes in your mind map? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1060.72-1064.34: Thanks, Chris. As you know, we've accelerated the development of K3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1064.74-1072.25: And this has an obvious impact on costs, both now with declining brine management spending and in the future as the mine ramps up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1072.93-1080.82: Beyond K3, we continue to see strong results from Valplane, which recorded its lowest cost position in more than a decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1082.10-1090.39: As we move forward, we're going to take advantage of owning two of only seven mines in the world with annual production capacity of over 3 million tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.07-1093.65: And with some of the lowest costs in the industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1094.25-1098.20: So as we look to the future, we intend to optimize. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.32-1110.01: The production coming from K3 and from our Bell Plain operation and only see running higher cost mines like Colanze if the market really requires it in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1112.03-1115.58: Another question comes to you from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1116.62-1124.74: In POTUS, you lowered your cost per ton of fare a bit, but how much of that was simply spreading fixed costs over a 20% larger volume? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.57-1135.40: On a fixed volume basis, what would your cost reduction be? Good question, Jonas. There is no question that the larger volume helps spread out our cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1136.22-1142.10: However, we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally changing our costs over the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.68-1148.17: We think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brine management costs as we shift to K3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1149.59-1152.09: K-1 underground mining will be completed this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.85-1158.78: Thrine management accounted for $8 a ton in Q2 and that will continue to decline as we move into 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.18-1169.13: And will be eliminated completely by 2022. So as you can see, a lot of our cost reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.51-1173.81: Staff P.J. Duvacar from Citi asked,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1173.89-1182.44: What kind of savings do you expect from sending K3 potash ore to the K1 mill and what is the updated timeline now to shut down K1 and K2? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1184.48-1191.81: Thank you, PJ. We expect to be sending potash to K1 and actually be shutting down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1191.87-1197.06: Our K1 shafts from a production perspective early in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.50-1206.03: That will start meaning we're only going to be operating two shafts and then by the end of 2022 only operating the one big K3 shaft. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.33-1210.19: At that point, the project will be complete. We'll eliminate brine inflow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1210.79-1217.44: And that really will be the end of our K1 and K2 mine stromal production perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.40-1229.25: Now Vincent Andrews is interested in how he should think about our PODF shipments in the second half of this year, given how strong shipments were in second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1229.85-1237.96: Also, can you remind him of the accounting for the Chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract agreement? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1240.76-1245.41: Thank you, Vincent. Yes, we did have strong shipments in quarter one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1245.43-1254.75: And if I refer to our discussions with CAMPATEX, I think they have a fairly full order book for Q3 and even going well into Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.12-1259.18: So I believe the shipments internationally will be strong in the second half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.46-1265.57: And domestically, we're expecting a good fall in North America. So we're expecting strong shipments there as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.75-1270.95: So from our perspective, our second half is looking pretty strong from a potash perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1271.21-1273.57: In terms of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.59-1284.96: The shipments in the first half, I'd just like to throw it over to Clint to explain a little bit about our China shipments to bonded warehouse that we rev-req'ed in the first half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1285.05-1286.87: Quint, can you describe that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.11-1296.98: Sure, John. And good morning, Vincent. So to start with, on a consolidated basis, we don't recognize revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.58-1302.12: Until that product is sold to a third party. However,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1303.30-1306.25: We do on a segment level basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.29-1313.03: We do recognize a revenue when CampaTex sells,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1313.05-1318.08: Product to our distribution business in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1318.36-1323.42: And when they sent that product to our distribution business in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.76-1332.17: The segment recognized revenue, but that was based on an estimate of pricing since the contract had not been completed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1332.97-1337.64: Once a contract was completed and the price for that transaction was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1337.66-1344.60: Set, that gave rise to the adjustment. But again, that's an adjustment on the potash segment only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1344.62-1351.07: Because we won't recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it's finally sold to a third party. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1353.99-1361.08: Thanks for that clarification, Quinn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1361.86-1369.99: We had four analysts, including John Roberts from UBS and Mark Connolly from Stevens, ask similar questions about the timing of volumes in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.11-1377.90: Resilient farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to be buying inputs well ahead of last year's schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1378.46-1381.96: How much do you think has been borrowed from the third quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1382.00-1388.49: And are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in third quarter margin to reflect those lower volumes next quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.51-1390.21: Specifically within the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.17-1397.38: April and May were significantly higher than the prior year months, while June appeared to be much closer to a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1397.66-1402.12: Is that just timing or are the trends decelerating into July? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.36-1413.05: Great question. The strong volumes in the first half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases as a result of generally favorable farm economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.63-1418.04: But year-over-year demand is expected to be up slightly to 37 million tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1418.14-1426.65: And in that figure, we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers gravitate towards higher analysis products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.91-1429.77: And high value products such as our micro essentials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.39-1435.72: Shot Mark Connelly at Stevens' ass. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.96-1447.25: How did the dramatic improvement in cost in Brazil break out between volume-driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change that should repeat with normal volumes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1451.65-1462.28: Thank you, Mark. Let me start by saying last year our operations were negatively impacted by the change in regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for dam improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.84-1472.23: That reduced volume and impacted our raw materials access. This year, we're benefiting from running at full operations rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.85-1480.44: This also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supply. Overall, that has helped a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.82-1486.45: So about a third of those costs are probably volume related. The others are... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.47-1495.38: Improvements to our freight, our inventory management, our overall planning, and of course structural changes to our cost structures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.94-1502.44: I think overall, though, we're seeing long-term changes to how the Brazil business is running. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1502.52-1511.17: And we're starting to see full benefit of the $330 million or so of integration benefit that we announced at the end of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.03-1516.80: TJ Juvacar has a question about currency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1517.40-1522.70: The Brazilian Rio Ebre, which is a US dollar, was down significantly year over year in the second quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1523.36-1529.33: How did that volatility impact you and what specifically was the impact in the quarter on Losaic for Los Angeles? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.35-1538.94: Thanks, PJ. I'd like to talk about two aspects of the Brazilian RE-I that really has changed things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1539.32-1543.32: And the first of those of course is the impact on farmer economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.50-1545.45: I think that is actually the bigger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.47-1553.85: Their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the Brazilian agriculture. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.63-1563.64: Segment is largely driven by great economics for the farmer. That's the first place we want to talk about where the Brazilian REAI has helped us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1563.92-1569.55: In terms of our cost performance, you will see that we tend to put our targets in REI base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.93-1574.29: So that allows us to understand what's the real underlying improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1575.42-1577.54: Obviously there was some positive impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1578.48-1582.18: I think we saw definite improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1582.20-1591.23: In our overall cost because of the REI, but I would say we focus more on what is the REI base cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1591.27-1596.58: Because that tells us whether we're really improving the business or just taking advantage of currency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.52-1602.10: So in the back you'll notice, sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1602.54-1606.81: PJ, I'd also like to point out that if you look at the back of our stuff, you'll see... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1606.91-1615.96: Basically our sensitivities and a 10 cent move in the REI amounts to about $20 million a year unhedged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1616.34-1626.25: So if we think about us as being about 50% hedge, it's fairly easy to do the reconciliation to last year's re-ICO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.37-1634.19: We have another question from Ben Isaacson with respect to mosaic for lozenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1635.14-1638.50: And Los Angeles' sales volumes have been notably higher year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1638.54-1645.71: You walk through the strategic strength of this business and how it relates to your mix between commodities and microessential funds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1649.23-1659.10: Thanks, Ben. Again, I've said this before, but I'll repeat. The volume growth really was a result of improvement in farm economics in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1660.00-1669.25: The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the REI, excellent barter ratios, and anticipation of a strong summer crop demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1669.79-1679.16: So, both commodity and performance products are showing robust increases in Q2 of 2020 versus a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1681.48-1685.95: Chris Parkinson asked for a COVID-19 update. His question is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.89-1693.81: Brazil is in the midst of a fairly complex COVID-19 outbreak, which has periodically been affecting the port and logistics system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.37-1702.14: Can you give us an update on the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you foresee during the peak fertilizer application season? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.07-1712.45: Thanks, Chris. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.47-1715.70: Because of the high level of community transmission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1716.22-1724.92: We have not been impacted on our operations to this point and we've instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1728.97-1734.11: And then from an overall country logistics perspective,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1734.19-1740.30: We believe that in general, we have been unaffected by COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.62-1743.50: Now, obviously there's going to be... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1743.52-1753.93: Local places where that impacts us. But in general, we've been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1754.37-1757.24: And from a demand perspective despite COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.72-1767.65: We've continued to see strong demand, again, driven by favorable farm economics, and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1772.67-1776.50: The last question we received from Mose Salazanche comes from Joel Jack. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.64-1784.58: Herlizonte's second quarter growth margin was more than double the results from the prior two years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1785.29-1790.31: How much of that gain was market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwind? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.01-1797.50: Versus share gain in the market versus a pull forward of Q3 because of COVID related logistics concerns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.92-1802.02: Thanks, Joel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1802.38-1817.44: I would summarize our results in the second quarter in Brazil as a couple of factors. First of all, if we looked at the exchange rate, it's probably offset almost perfectly the change in pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1817.62-1820.14: So what we see in actual results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.24-1827.91: Is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the dam costs that we saw last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1831.81-1839.38: Doc, we received a handful of questions on the balance sheet, primarily focused on uses of free cash flow. John Roberts asks,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1840.10-1847.53: What are the capital allocation priorities moving forward and can you please discuss your growth, debt level, dividend and potential share repurchases? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.71-1857.84: And TJ Duvacar asked, beyond paying down some debt, what could be uses of cash, especially with improved free cash flow in the second half of 2020? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1858.42-1864.32: Would buyback fee approved use of cash over the countervailing duty decision prevent you from buying back stocks? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.37-1869.21: Josh, can you talk about capital priorities to address both of these questions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.57-1873.37: Thank you, gentlemen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1874.37-1883.30: Our capital priorities are unchanged and they continue to be what we've said in the past. Our first priority is to maintain the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1884.22-1890.03: Next priority, maintain investment grade metrics. And to do that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.05-1894.39: We have to continue our normal capital plan as we've had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.40-1900.00: We expect to lower debt by about a billion dollars over the next few years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1900.46-1904.44: Doing so when our bonds come due in the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1905.07-1913.79: And then continue some of the key projects like the Esther Hazy K-3 acceleration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.31-1918.94: And then what we have after that returning capital to shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1919.56-1929.49: All free lease are dependent on future cash flow generation and capital allocation will not be impacted in any way by the countervailing duties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1934.71-1939.26: We've also had a couple of questions from a BISAD analyst and they include. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.30-1946.03: Can you describe what's included in the $610 million of short-term debt that you indicated will be paid in 2020? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1946.71-1953.99: And Doug Mulday still plan to keep about a billion dollar cash balance and pay down in 2021 maturity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1955.86-1965.41: Thanks for the question. At the start of this year, we did increase our cash balance to a billion dollars by first of all taking out... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1965.43-1973.75: Some money from our revolver and executing on some of our inventory financing debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.35-1984.06: Since that time, we've paid down the revolver and we will continue to pay down the rest of the $600 million in short-term debt throughout the rest of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.95-1991.49: Before we move on to market-related questions, Ben Isaacson asked about our tax rate outlook. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.87-2001.84: Why is your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid to high 50s? And how should we think about this rate under a Trump or Biden presidency? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2006.41-2009.45: Thank you, Ben. Let me start by saying. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.49-2020.76: The first part of this is, and the reason for the tax rate being higher is our income mix between our three jurisdictions, Canada, Brazil, and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.18-2027.45: The details of that, I'm gonna actually hand it over to Clint to explain why. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2027.47-2032.39: The negative earnings in the US will create a higher tax rate overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2035.12-2043.42: Yeah, thanks, Jock. And Ben, that's right. It really comes down to an earnings mix phenomenon for us, if you recall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2044.34-2051.19: The tax rate is based on gap results by jurisdiction. And when you look at the United States,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2051.73-2056.96: Not only is our phosphate business incorporated into that, but also our corporate GNA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2057.56-2059.52: Our interest expense and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.46-2066.95: There are times when that prepacked income in the U.S. Turns negative and that can begin to skew the rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2067.81-2072.41: We need to then start to factor in things like some of the foreign currency moves that we've seen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.41-2080.54: And how it affects our mark to market and some of the notable items that we have on our schedule, that begins to skew it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2081.04-2084.34: As you've seen Brazil improve this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.11-2090.77: That's our highest rate tax jurisdiction. So that begins to influence that rate as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2090.79-2095.70: The combination of all of those things that's resulting in an unusually high tax rate for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.72-2098.16: And then I'd add two things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.20-2107.17: One, on a longer term basis, we would expect that effective tax rate to be somewhere in the mid to high 20s. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.71-2116.20: But then I would also call to your attention that our cash tax rates and payments are much different than that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2116.28-2122.16: As a matter of fact, this year, we expect to end up with a small cash tax refund. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2122.50-2126.83: So very different than the effective tax rate in our financial statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2131.65-2133.43: Now let's move on to market-related questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2134.45-2142.76: Mike Piken asked if you could comment on our summer fill programs in the US and where we see downstream inventories in the US at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2146.57-2154.75: Thank you, Michael. I think we've had fairly successful fill programs in both phosphate and potash here in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.80-2165.53: Recent discussions that we've had with our customers suggested they're probably in the range of 60% full for the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.57-2170.11: Fall season. So there will be increased buying towards the fall season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2170.17-2176.56: But for the most part, our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2181.70-2188.83: Steve Byrne is looking for insight into future volumes. How are you trending in each of the segments through the month of July on a year-over-year basis? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2189.41-2195.12: Do you see volumes higher in the third quarter? Any expectations for volumes for the rest of the year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2198.02-2199.42: I would characterize Q3 as a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2199.44-2204.88: Is largely having our order of books full for both phosphate and potash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.90-2221.80: And so it'll be a matter of delivery and revenue recognition that will determine where we are for quarter three. But we expect a reasonably good fall in the US and global markets are running well. So for both phosphates and potash,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2222.08-2226.69: We expect relatively normal Q3 volumes in both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2226.81-2232.15: And then for the rest of the year, we should also see a good stable volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2234.37-2243.04: Josh, Mark Connolly would like insight into grain and oil seed price implications. How important to Mosaic's earnings outlook are higher grain and oil seed prices? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2243.74-2248.03: The current price of corn is sustained through 2020 and soybeans stay at or near their current. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.47-2252.57: Do you think there is any material room for higher P&K prices in the market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.39-2260.30: Thank you, Mark. Clearly, oilseed and grain prices do have implications for us, but in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.66-2266.13: The farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.39-2271.59: What's a lot more important to us is planting intentions, number of acres planted, and the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2271.67-2278.96: And remember also that grain and oil seeds are just a few of the products that we fertilize. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2279.02-2283.58: It really depends on what does the whole global market look like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2283.98-2290.73: And what is the demand for P and K and what is supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain and oil seed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2290.91-2295.22: It has an indirect impact, but I would say no direct impact on our pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2297.12-2300.58: Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley wants to know about our market forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2301.24-2308.99: Given that the last 10 years of TNK shipments show some patterned lumpiness, potash more than phosphate,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2309.53-2312.93: Why not forecast luckiness going forward rather than just cagers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2315.62-2321.58: Thanks Vincent. We tend to forecast on annual growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2322.60-2329.95: Simply because some of the other factors that go into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2330.03-2334.79: And those are really inventory movements globally and of course weather. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2335.74-2336.90: You saw in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2336.92-2356.02: 2019, the weather impacts in the US made a fundamental difference to the growth rate of both phosphate and potash on a global scale. So we really have to look at it on averages, but recognize that there will be lumpiness as we go forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2361.54-2367.29: We're going to move on to some questions on Fonse. This one is from Ben Isaacson. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2368.29-2373.49: The benchmark NAP selling price fell by $16 to $314 per ton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2373.51-2378.32: Yet Mosaic's average finished product selling price fell by almost three times that amount. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2378.34-2382.26: I'll buy $44, $2308, and $352. Why? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.90-2387.43: How should we think about this relationship going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.75-2399.08: The answer here is simply that the average selling price in Port LaVantage is based on all the components we sell, including urea. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.10-2402.38: And potash in the blends, both of which are down significantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.86-2410.95: So when you look at that relationship going forward, you have to take into account all three products that could be in our blends that we sell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.65-2419.96: Ben also asked, staff shipping margins have started to improve in July after remaining largely flat throughout the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.68-2424.12: Are you seeing this flow through to the phosphate fragments margin? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2428.57-2429.59: Thank you, Ben, again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2430.37-2437.78: Depth serving margin, we track that because that really is what do we get after the cost of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2437.80-2444.84: Raw materials and transport as revenue. So of course this flows directly into our margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2445.01-2450.11: An improvement in stripping margin really is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.13-2454.33: Almost directly related to our overall profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.90-2460.62: Would like to know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2460.90-2469.05: So what does MOSAIC see as the equilibrium prices of U.S. NOLA DAP and MAP versus key offshore French markets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2472.99-2475.90: All I can really say is that I'm very proud of the work that I've done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2475.92-2485.53: Say there is if you look at it historically other than the last say three years where there's been a real increase in imports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2486.59-2492.61: We have seen NOLA prices being similar to other global prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2492.63-2509.57: And I would expect that under a more fair trade market, that's what you would see is you would see the NOLA price being equal to what the prices and other markets adjusted for the transport cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.15-2519.36: And that's exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they readjust that market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2523.26-2531.03: Jacques Siegborn would like more insight into our global phosphate demand outlook and its relationship to inventory swings specifically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2532.01-2536.60: What is your estimate of underlying global consumption of phosphate in 2009? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2537.08-2543.20: And was it below the shipment for 71 million tons? Did it reflect channel inventory? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2545.79-2554.09: Thank you, Steve. If we look at 2019, there was no question that there was buildup of global inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.27-2556.46: Particularly in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2556.70-2564.98: In the US, there was a poor season and the imports in particular kept coming in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.09-2571.43: We shut down our Louisiana operation for a number of months last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2571.61-2575.78: And still the inventory build in the US was very high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.12-2584.24: Likewise, the Brazilian inventory was probably slightly above normal coming into this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.26-2586.13: Maybe some of the same reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.99-2594.65: But what I will say is in the first and second quarter of this year, we have largely cleared out all of that inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2594.95-2600.00: And probably have moved from an area of high inventory to very low. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2600.14-2604.18: Inventory and phosphates as we move into the third quarter of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2609.87-2617.52: A related question, he also asked, are normalized inventory levels the reason for the increased phosphate shipment forecast in 2021? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2621.08-2630.91: Thanks, Steve. Yeah, in terms of 2021, what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much leveled off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2630.95-2639.70: And we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year. So that 2% type annual growth in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2642.70-2645.79: Vincent Andrews would like our opinion on pharma economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2646.09-2654.33: He asks, given the recent run up in DAP prices, are you at all concerned about US farmers deferring fall applications? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2660.00-2666.39: Our experience has been, and if you look even at the spring with the COVID uncertainty, that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.41-2674.33: Farmers will put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs and their needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2674.37-2678.64: And frankly, today with precision agriculture,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2678.76-2684.90: They're more likely to put the right amount of fertilizers on every year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2684.92-2693.83: And phosphate prices, frankly, also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2693.87-2702.86: So I don't believe that most farmers will look at phosphate pricing and have it change their application. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2703.36-2711.53: But I'd also highlight that phosphate prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oil seed prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2711.69-2720.74: Are. So as with most fall seasons, we would expect that weather will be the main arbitrator of demand and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2720.76-2726.57: With expecting an early crop maturity this year, we expect we should have a good fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2731.75-2738.44: To three questions related to China and phosphate. First, Vincent Andrews asks,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2739.20-2745.19: What do you anticipate will be the Chinese DAP exports in the second half of 2020? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2745.89-2748.55: Second half 2020 gap rate, does that assume? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2749.47-2753.93: If staff prices are higher or lower than your assumption, what would happen to Chinese exports? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2758.88-2765.39: These exports over the first half of the year were lowered by about 800,000 tons from last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2765.89-2771.25: Now our base forecast calls for Chinese exports to end the year about 600,000 tons lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2772.25-2780.60: In other words, we expect that international pricing is a little higher. We'll incent a few extra tons coming out of China in the second half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2780.78-2789.31: And if prices are higher than our expectations, there might be a little bit more upside, but we don't see significant upside. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2789.37-2795.00: And part of the reason for this is domestic demand is coming in fairly strong as we move into fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2795.32-2800.84: And I think the big issue there will be export availability limitations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2801.22-2808.77: Now obviously if our prices are lower than expectations, the volumes could be even lower than what they are now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2815.34-2819.78: Goldstein and Steve Byrne both asked about production specifically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2820.38-2830.15: What is the status and outlook for reduced phosphate production at specific facilities in China and Tunisia? And do you expect lower exports over the next several years? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2832.49-2834.69: Well, let me hit China first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2836.80-2841.36: There's been a well-known shift towards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.38-2847.09: Shutting down some of the higher polluting plants, particularly along the Yancey River. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2847.99-2857.66: And we've seen some here that have resulted in production declines in the first half of the year. In terms of Chinese export volume over the next years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2858.18-2862.58: We maintain that Chinese exports will trend lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2863.02-2870.37: And will establish a new normal. I mean, we've now seen what we think is the bottoming of Chinese domestic demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2870.99-2879.62: And we're seeing a lowering of production. So with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they meet domestic demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.60-2888.57: Towards Tunisia, it would appear that expectations for plant resurgence of production in 2020 were somewhat overstated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2889.69-2898.80: But it's also important to put Tunisia in context. They have produced an average of about 750,000 tons of DAP and TSP over the last five years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2899.66-2903.34: Current protests will certainly lead to shattering of their raw production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2903.82-2910.85: The business plagued them for over a decade, so which means we would expect them to stay about the same RAM rate as we go forward as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2914.13-2919.10: John, the last section of questions relates to how to ask the global market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2920.86-2925.83: Steve Byrne and Seth Goldstein asked about the impact of palm oil demand on potash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.55-2932.97: What is the typical lag between movement in palm oil prices and changes in potash demand in Southeast Asia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2933.07-2938.70: And has the rebound in palm oil pricing resulted in increased potash demand in Southeast Asia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2940.92-2948.53: Thank you, gentlemen. The palm oil demand is important for PODASH. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2948.85-2956.24: And what we have seen recently is an improvement in palm oil prices and we know that for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2956.26-2961.90: Production reasons, they will be adding potash to their palm oil plantations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2962.12-2965.89: So we see that as a fairly direct relationship. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2966.59-2973.59: I wouldn't say we see increased demand, but we see demand that is getting back to its normal levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2973.93-2976.54: In terms of a longer term,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2976.56-2984.16: Export demand and domestic demand for biofuels is helping in terms of optimism for recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2984.32-2993.77: So all of these things mean that we should see a better demand for potash in the Southeast Asia region, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2996.86-3004.18: Joel Jackson and Ben Isakson would both like to understand where global product inventories stand in the various regions, particularly in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3008.95-3011.07: Thank you, gentlemen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3012.87-3021.14: If we look at China, there's sort of a bifurcation of inventory. We know there's about 3.5 million tons at the port. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3021.76-3030.95: But we believe there's relatively low inventories as we move inland. And so as we're now seeing a strong demand for NPKs in the domestic market,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3031.31-3035.42: We do expect with the movements out of the port to those NPK plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3035.78-3040.04: We'll start bringing down inventory levels, assuming that the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3040.58-3044.44: Arrivals are about at normal levels compared to last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.63-3061.42: Mark Connelly and Steve Byrne are both interested in potash demand growth. What is driving the acceleration in potash demand in your podcast and are there specific geographies? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3064.99-3071.23: I wouldn't say we're actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3071.51-3080.76: Our potash demand growth from a long-term trend is staying fairly steady at what we believe to be around 3%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3081.06-3087.37: And if you take 2019 out of it, I think we still stay just on that trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3089.15-3098.68: In a related question, if demand ends up toward the high end of your range, do you see increased supply balance in the market, or would you expect the market to tighten? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3102.86-3112.25: Well, I guess this requires two things. One, the success of production ramp-ups on the new projects, particularly, I guess, Eurochem's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3112.35-3115.32: I'm Volga Calian Yarsoltsky. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3115.86-3125.85: But given the delays we've seen in recent years on these ramp ups, it would seem that the market should tighten actually if demand comes in at the high end of our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3130.33-3136.60: And the last related question also, what is the bull case for potash pricing over a three to five year period? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3138.56-3139.64: The neck room. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3139.66-3153.81: Factors that could create a bull run in potash prices. And the first I've already mentioned, which is slower ramp up of the projects, particularly the ones in Russia and Belorussia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3154.89-3164.44: But what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the North American assets over the next, say, three to five years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3164.54-3167.93: And a more modest rise in prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3168.41-3170.19: That would suggest prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3171.15-3178.48: Appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in 2018 and utilization of athletes goes up at the same time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3181.32-3185.23: Another product-related question from Adam Samuelson and Ben Iverson. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.33-3192.85: They're both asking about the disconnect between pricing trends between Brazilian MOP that rallied off lows in the second quarter versus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3192.87-3197.54: US and Southeast Asian MOP prices that have continued to leak lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3198.14-3202.16: Strong Brazilian economics enough to offset this weakness in other regions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3206.55-3214.81: Thanks. Brazilian farm economics are really outstanding at present, which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market, and we expect that to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3215.60-3224.97: And for the US and Southeast Asian markets, I think it's important to remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3225.35-3226.73: And that will impact prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3227.27-3231.67: I'd also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3231.79-3239.62: And it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see first a rebound in demand and then prices following after that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3243.98-3246.45: We have now completed our... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3246.47-3255.16: Pre-submitted questions. And so now I would like to do is open it up to the audience for live Q&A. Operator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3256.50-3262.22: Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3262.58-3270.55: To withdraw a question, please press the down key. We will limit the question to one per participant to allow the others questions to be addressed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3270.97-3274.47: Thank you. Please stand by while we compile the QnA roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3280.98-3286.45: First question comes from the line of Adam Samson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.35-3290.49: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3291.01-3298.04: So I guess I want to just follow up on the affordability question, Josh, on phosphates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3298.08-3304.52: On your own kind of affordability metric that you publish, we're now above long-term average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3304.74-3309.07: Just trying to think about where you would see an upper limit to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3309.31-3313.25: Especially if you think about next year and farmer income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3313.27-3321.78: Risks from government support programs in the US or lack thereof, given the big farmer support payments that have been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3321.80-3323.58: Experience both this year and last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3326.63-3327.77: Thanks, Adam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3329.75-3337.94: There's certainly a relationship between crop prices and how people feel about the imports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3338.36-3346.35: But as you say, support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmer incomes at least stable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3347.21-3349.83: And yes, while we're pushing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3350.75-3360.46: Phosphate and potash prices, certainly phosphate is a little bit closer to that ratio. Two things on this I'd say is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3360.64-3363.90: First of all, you've got to look at December 21 prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3364.18-3366.79: And if you look at December 21 prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3367.13-3369.79: I think we... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3369.81-3376.84: I think we'd be looking at what, 360 for corn and nine bucks for being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3376.90-3389.53: So, they're going to see some reasonable prices on there if they sold forward into that market. So, they'd be incented to get a good crop and use the fertilizer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3389.83-3393.21: But in terms of the direct relationship between the two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.39-3401.88: I'd say you could easily go a standard deviation above that ratio and not have it materially affect demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3407.77-3413.23: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3414.99-3429.89: I just wanted to hear whether or not you saw any impact on phosphate imports during the month of July following the countervailing duty petition and just ask for an update on your. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3429.91-3435.42: Your gypsum sales out of the gypstacks in Brazil. Any update on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3437.68-3445.15: Sure, thanks Steve. First of all, in July I believe the imports were lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3446.39-3451.85: I'd have to get an exact number and get someone to get back to him on how much that was down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3452.15-3466.03: But our understanding and we did talk to a lot of customers and our understanding is certainly the importers who are importing either the OCP or the Russian products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3466.11-3475.10: I definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might be in terms of them picking up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3475.12-3480.00: Some sort of countervailing duty risk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3480.10-3490.21: We did see a step back in July, whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months, I don't know. What we have seen, however, is new products coming in from places like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3490.23-3495.64: Egypt and Australia and Mexico. So it does say there is some change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3497.14-3503.98: I got to have somebody to give me, what was the second part of your question there, Steve? I missed in my writing. 
asr:0: END
