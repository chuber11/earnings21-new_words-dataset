asr:0: OUTPUT 1293.01-1298.14: May cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.50-1302.58: We expect that our fourth quarter 2020 revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1302.60-1308.87: Will be in the range of $122 million to $132 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.25-1319.14: After considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our fourth quarter gross margin on a non-GAAP basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.16-1323.02: Will be in the range of 41% to 42%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.56-1334.85: We also expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be between $50 and $51 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1336.34-1342.26: And finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.28-1355.14: On a non-GAAP basis will be a benefit at a mid-single-digit percentage rate resulting from the expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.02-1362.98: We believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1363.00-1369.57: Will be component availability, a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.59-1373.43: Ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1373.73-1378.86: The variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1378.88-1384.72: The proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1384.74-1390.73: Professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.33-1395.72: The adoption rate of our broadband access platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1395.74-1405.45: Potential changes in tax laws, currency exchange rate movements, and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.79-1416.60: Once again, additional financial information is available at ADTRAN's investor relations webpage at www.ADTRAN.com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1416.82-1419.20: Now I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1420.22-1425.19: Great. Thank you, Mike. And at this point, we're ready to open up for any questions people may have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.71-1434.57: At this time, if you'd like to ask a question over the phone lines, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.24-1441.48: Your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.22-1452.29: Thank you, good morning. Tom, you mentioned that you, sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier one in Q3 when you talked about your new customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.31-1457.14: I just wanted to clarify, is that the case? And if it is, can you say anything about that, that would? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.54-1467.87: I did actually say that in my notes, but in reality we did announce a new tier one at the end of September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1469.37-1471.75: Which was for fiber extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.41-1477.68: And we did pick up another tier one customer within the quarter where they expanded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.70-1484.74: Their programs with us to include a different variation on the technology that we had been previously awarded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.01-1486.95: Or have some, but I didn't mention any of my notes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1489.17-1490.21: Got it, that's helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.23-1499.60: I think you also mentioned that you've made good progress with your previously announced tier ones and I guess those who include among others DT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.00-1508.41: Open reach maybe and the unnamed US Tier 1. Is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and or revenue? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1508.43-1511.05: Expectations, initial revenue expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.99-1517.32: So one of those is a brand new customer force, as you're aware. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1519.18-1525.31: All three of them are going well. All three of them are at different stages of lab work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.87-1531.17: We actually have received some POs from the new customer, but that's associated with... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.21-1539.80: Initial lab work and some of the software work that we're doing for them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.38-1544.12: So that actually booked and shipped in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.47-1554.91: But all three of them are going well. So we expect material revenue contributions from them to really start in the first half, towards the tail end of the first half of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1557.28-1560.00: And then,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1560.48-1562.26: Question on order. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1562.52-1571.17: You've talked about it being kind of a mid 21 revenue opportunity. I think some of your competitors have suggested maybe it's more of a 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.05-1581.04: Any further clarification on your thoughts on timing, is that sort of a 3Q, 21, or 4Q, any thoughts on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1582.12-1589.69: Yeah, and I guess here again, this is the different, you know, when does it, it's one of those things that's gonna start, it will start slower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.69-1600.66: You know you have so many participants some of them have plans completely worked out some of them don't have plans at all they've been just focusing on the bidding process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.24-1606.63: So I think you'll start seeing it around the half and then you'll start seeing it ramp up from there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1608.63-1613.63: Just one more, Mike, modeling question on OPEX levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1614.97-1623.06: If we're looking into next year, and I know you don't give guidance out there, but if we're trying to think about what an OPEX number looks like, it's kind of a normalized T&E level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.08-1629.41: Any thoughts on how much that maybe adds back into the model as P&E gets back to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.01-1631.37: You know, some kind of normalized level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.35-1641.12: We expect, you know, we've had a plan to get to about where we are right now, and we expect that we're going to hold that into next year or so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1641.38-1644.78: I wouldn't try to model any increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1645.15-1650.37: I think like a lot of companies, everybody's rethinking the whole T&E going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1650.85-1656.70: I think your model going into next year should look a lot like what we're seeing at the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1658.60-1661.48: Very good. Thank you for that, Mike. I'll see the book. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1663.12-1668.95: Thank you. Your next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1671.31-1674.43: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. This is Bala Reddy on Kororad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1675.46-1678.74: Just to start off, could you give us some color on... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.76-1683.36: What you're seeing in terms of broadband demand and activity here in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.38-1689.27: And maybe try to handicap that across the tier 1, 2, 3, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1689.31-1694.23: And then also how you're thinking about the sustainability of the momentum into next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1698.32-1705.51: First, a lot of activity, and I touched on the growth rates in the tier three space, a lot of activity in the tier threes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1707.35-1711.71: Which is separate from what's going on with RDOF. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.29-1719.58: A lot of network upgrades. We rolled out our combo card, which is the 10-gig solution, a good pickup on a combo card. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.22-1726.73: And so just a lot of activity and I think a lot of it has got to do with just end user demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1726.79-1732.73: Based off of the environment that we are in and people understanding the importance of good connectivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1734.39-1740.02: Same thing in the Tier 2s. I think the Tier 2s are finally getting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.16-1748.15: Past whatever financial issues they may have had and some of them have started executing, one of them explicitly has started executing on expansion plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1749.45-1751.23: And I don't see that stopping. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1752.11-1759.94: And I think the other one actually is kind of woken up and getting better. And that includes not just those, but some of the MSOs as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1760.32-1767.61: So I don't see a near-term end. In fact, I see people planning farther out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1767.75-1776.72: Then and kind of figuring out how they're going to readjust to what may be a different work environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1776.78-1780.52: In a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1781.14-1787.21: I don't think it's all pandemic driven either. I mean, the activity that's going on in the tier twos has been part of their stated plan. It just got put off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1787.69-1793.95: The tier threes have been heating up for some period of time, even prior to that. We had solid growth in that space last year as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1795.40-1799.54: And then the tier ones, you know, we really in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.00-1804.82: We're in the cable MSO space and we're with large carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1804.94-1810.33: And with one of the large carriers here in the TOCO space in relation to pollen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.01-1820.48: And I would say the activity there is, I would say we've seen good activity. I wouldn't call it, you know, earth shattering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.54-1821.68: I would say it's solid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.68-1829.65: And a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year. So I think a lot of that is just. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.19-1835.18: I think a real pickup there will probably be a year, this time next year, maybe a little bit earlier than that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.62-1837.64: Did that answer your question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1840.00-1849.57: So, thanks so much. And just a quick follow up on the gross margins, and you mentioned about the volumes and product mix. Maybe you can expand on it a little bit, like what volumes you're talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1852.89-1861.30: So it's product mix. At the end of the day, we're selling without getting too deep into. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1861.54-1866.35: We're selling pond. One of the things, if you step back and look at what our business has done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1868.27-1872.85: We've really made the transition from copper to fiber. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1873.81-1879.32: And some of the fiber components that we're selling specifically when you're talking about OLT and stuff just have a richer mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.02-1889.19: We also have, based off of international and domestic revenue mix, we have a material difference in those gross margin profiles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1889.55-1893.69: Those are probably the two biggest things that were driving the gross margin difference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1900.04-1904.74: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein of Calland. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1906.29-1909.01: Just a clarification first before my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1909.29-1917.54: To the response to the previous question, obviously I trust non-US lower margin than the US as a general proposition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1918.08-1922.58: But on the product piece of the revenue, I apologize if you just said this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1922.88-1929.43: The margin differential it's more favorable for your fiber based or less favorable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.63-1938.92: That the distinction making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile in what is the key? difference there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1941.14-1948.55: I would say what's happening in the fiber space is we're selling... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1948.57-1952.33: The mix towards OLTs is much higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1953.47-1961.26: Exactly right so that that's the key driver the product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1963.00-1968.19: That's probably you know i don't have a list of that that's definitely in the top three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.51-1971.21: We might have really strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.41-1976.18: I thought that it might be close to a few of the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1976.20-1984.06: In terms of launch or market profile, you obviously just have a very good market quarter driven by both volume and the shift to LTs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1984.44-1990.71: The guiding back to your traditional guidance in the low 40s for the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1991.61-1999.66: Has there been any change in your view about longer term? Are you still looking at low 40s, gross margin profile longer term or with the benefit of volume? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.24-2004.38: Which shifts are all fees, can that be better than that? And then I've got one follow-up question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2006.21-2015.28: Yeah, I think I would say low to mid, so somewhere right in that range. And you see variability in here. Remember in Q1, we were pretty hot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2016.28-2021.40: So it jumps around a lot. So I tried to project this by looking at what we see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.66-2028.47: But we are a book and ship business and what comes in during a quarter is a little bit hard to test. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2028.49-2035.92: I believe that that 41 to 42 guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2037.30-2042.68: I think the variability also is a thing to maybe think about, Paul. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2042.70-2047.61: We don't have, we don't know exactly what tier threes will do next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.87-2057.36: The tier threes are strong. That typically helps us because not just the nature of what they buy, but also the software components associated with that. So that tends to drive more strength. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2057.84-2061.44: Thing that we're trying to factor in at this point in not changing the longer-term guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2061.88-2068.59: There is a real potential for material international revenue upticking next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2068.99-2072.67: And whether or not the tier threes here in the US are going to keep pace with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.09-2076.42: It is kind of the thing that we just have to look and see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2076.68-2078.94: There's no doubt that the pressure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2079.30-2088.73: Some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like Europe because of the stance on some of the vendors there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.15-2097.16: But there's still a hangover effect on all of that. And the stronger that that business is, you'll tend to see a weakness in the gross margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.52-2104.72: You just made a selfie to make good progress in tier 3. What percentage of total revenue are tier 3 today? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.21-2114.29: Really don't break that out. I'll tell you it's material. It's over 50 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2115.44-2117.04: But we don't break that up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2119.44-2127.05: Quick final question if I may. I know it's hard predicting the future, but assuming you get the revenues you're expecting from these new tier one wins,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.27-2133.17: Tom, do you have any visibility as to what the margin profile is in total? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.55-2142.30: Not asking any specific customer, but on the tier ones, would that be consistent with the current margin structure? Would it be diluted? Would it be accretive? Any sense? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.36-2153.69: I'm going to talk to you about international gross margins. It would probably be a little accretive to international gross margins, but it would be diluted to total corporate gross margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.16-2156.58: I appreciate all possible. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2157.48-2166.65: And that's the mix I'm talking about. How much does that pile in? That gets better over time. How much does that pile in versus what's going on with the US market in tier 3? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2168.81-2178.34: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Gazzello of Tyson Capital. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2179.46-2182.04: Thank you. A couple of different questions. First of all,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2182.14-2190.45: The two tier ones, the one that you won and the one with the new program that you specifically called out,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.07-2192.45: Would you talk about the ramp? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.11-2203.10: And the timing for material revenues, and is that different than your comment about late in the first half of next year that you made it to a bigger comment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2203.84-2212.79: And then the second question is, can you talk through just the European country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2213.29-2215.24: What implications, if any, that has for you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2217.46-2218.72: Let me start with the first one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.68-2222.94: The first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2222.96-2232.55: The half ramp that I was talking about was really around the previous SDX awards, the three customers that we've talked about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2232.57-2241.32: And really I'm talking about in totality. There are some different dates on all of those, but we'll start saying as a combination. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.34-2243.88: We'll start seeing material revenue around the half of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.21-2254.35: As far as the new ones, one of them is fairly quick, but as far as seeing any revenue,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2256.50-2261.42: I think it's, I don't have a good sense of timing as to when that picks up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2262.00-2268.63: At this point, I think that they want to get started and they have some very targeted areas and then they want to kind of see how it works. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2269.63-2275.82: The other one is very specific, and Mike, I don't recall the date on that. I think it's third quarter of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.58-2278.80: And that one is big. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2280.48-2282.84: It's a well-known customer to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.40-2294.37: They have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it. The current date is third quarter. Make sure I will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2295.24-2297.90: What I was talking about before was really the fiber piece. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2298.40-2300.00: As far as the shutdown is concerned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2300.06-2301.12: Other than, you know... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2301.14-2310.57: It really hasn't, you know, we've been operating in a relatively shut down environment anyways from an end user demand, really no difference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2310.89-2314.03: And we haven't seen any near-term changes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2314.59-2322.98: In the way that they're operating. Where it really affects us is when you're trying to meet with customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2323.00-2327.57: And really, you know, with the lab activity we have going on around the world right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2327.73-2329.21: It tends to impact that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.23-2341.02: So far we've been able to maneuver around that. I'm not aware of any material delay because of the quarantine situation that we're in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2341.30-2346.61: And I don't expect it, I think, especially our bigger customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2346.75-2349.91: But even our small customers when I think about what's going on in Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2350.01-2358.98: Have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab, work through issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2359.14-2362.34: In many cases, get into the systems themselves remotely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.92-2371.19: And operate the way we need to operate. So I'm not, every once in a while you hear about a week delay here or there, but that's not that frequent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2372.83-2377.40: And deployment is not impacted by stay-at-home orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2377.82-2391.93: No change in that. And even in Europe, what we were seeing as far as infrastructure, especially with the new awards, we're talking about material infrastructure builds to begin with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2392.23-2401.38: Because they're really talking about building out footprint, either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding footprint in many cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2401.88-2404.32: There's been no change in those plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2406.05-2415.28: Great, thank you. And if I may throw in one more question. Latin America, what are you seeing with your important customers down there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.92-2428.33: So in the Caribbean we're actually doing well. We have some strong... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2428.65-2434.13: I don't want to overplay it at this point. We have some activity going on in places like Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.71-2439.50: Whether also of course honestly, you know the SPX maybe you know the SPX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.18-2445.99: Is kind of the architecture people want to go to and so there are large carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2446.15-2456.80: There's not a large carrier that isn't looking at a migration towards XGS 10 gig. And if you're going to do that, you're going to do that with a virtualized system like the SDX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2457.36-2460.38: So there is activity going on there. Those tend to be longer term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.66-2470.63: We do have one traditional customer down there. There are still ongoing negotiations with that customer, but there's no material change at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.67-2475.64: Thank you for the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2477.92-2483.02: Your next question comes from the line of Bahadur Jarr of MKM Partners. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2491.87-2496.46: I apologize if you've already addressed this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2496.92-2502.26: Are you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2505.11-2513.65: No, no. We did at the beginning of the pandemic, so if you think about kind of the end of Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2514.43-2517.08: We saw a material increase in odor activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.44-2528.41: I think at this point in time, I would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2528.91-2529.97: I don't see any real. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2531.47-2541.36: We do on particular parts. I talked a little bit about the fact that we're still having some supply issues, most predominantly with silicon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2541.86-2548.41: But in those cases, we may really try to nail down a forecast with them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.69-2553.17: And try to get them to reach farther out, but that's really not the norm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2555.92-2563.70: Okay, that's helpful. If I look forward to next year with all these tier one ramping,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2564.26-2566.85: How should we be thinking about your customer concentration? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.31-2568.63: Is most important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2568.87-2570.17: You all have a really tough question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2571.93-2576.44: So we are adding tier one customers as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2577.30-2586.63: So the good news is that there will be more tier ones to kind of spread the fluctuations around within. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2588.07-2592.65: But having said that, we're also adding more tier 1s, so you've got that issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2593.59-2603.34: We are adding tier threes, and I use tier threes, I'm really talking about alternate carriers of all different types. We're adding municipalities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.42-2605.29: On a very fast clip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2606.53-2615.05: I mean, we usually have an internal announcement here or something that goes out. And we have a weekly update here and there's always a municipality that's being added. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2615.98-2621.64: And we're adding tier threes to traditional tier three carriers. I have a very quick clip I think I mentioned before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2621.66-2626.53: 30 something odd customers a large percent of those were these alternate type carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2627.09-2635.88: So from that perspective, and by the way, I mentioned we had a distribution partner that was actually a top 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2636.66-2638.42: Customer, that is not typical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2639.18-2642.30: I do believe that that will be typical going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2642.52-2651.75: Because I do believe and those are all being sold those are one of our conduits to that alternate carry that municipal space tier three space. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2653.05-2655.14: And utilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2655.42-2658.16: So that base is growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2659.82-2667.17: Now when we get into this time next year, it'll still be kind of early in the cycle of some of these wins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2667.25-2673.83: Will begin to this time next year, it's really how are those tier ones comparing to the growth rate within the tier threes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2674.01-2680.60: I have no doubt we'll be more diverse, but we're adding tier ones in a nice clip as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2681.48-2684.06: But we will have more customers which will help in that diversity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.55-2686.99: And then one other thing I just want to add. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2687.17-2695.56: I mentioned before the catch rates on our CPE gear and our RGs and some of our new Wi-Fi solutions is really growing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2696.26-2699.50: Which will help add in that product diversity as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2704.80-2707.11: That's really helpful. Thanks for the call on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2708.75-2713.51: So I think one last question for me is more topical, a big picture view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2713.79-2719.68: I think AT&T recently announced that they're going to stop selling their copper-based DSL service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2720.48-2725.43: So it seems like a secular shift towards fiber is ongoing in the sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2725.45-2731.27: You know with all the major tier ones around the world migrating towards fiber. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2732.09-2737.92: Can you talk a little bit about your competitive positioning in the Viber? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2738.00-2742.40: Is it similar to copper that you enjoyed previously or is it actually better? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2745.51-2748.11: Of the hangovers that we had come through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.23-2760.02: We've had a couple of programs, really one big program that was copper bait that died, which caused us an issue, but really it was the longevity of the copper. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2760.66-2764.58: And the R&D requirements associated with that copper versus the fiber. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2765.17-2774.51: And I think this is the first quarter, depending on how you count it, where you're really seeing fiber eclipse copper within our revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2775.70-2783.82: And so to us, that's a big milestone. And it really, because there's a lot of work to make that happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2786.25-2792.15: So I'm happy with the shift within the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2792.17-2798.82: And if you look at the R&D spend, the R&D spend is predominantly fiber-based and has been for some time. So I'm glad to be able to... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2798.84-2800.44: See the revenue kind of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2800.46-2803.44: Mimic what it is that we've been doing internally here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2804.04-2806.59: Competitively right now we're in a very good position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2807.41-2814.85: We have launched new flexibility and new capabilities in our Total Access 5000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2814.87-2821.96: Platform product which has been in the market for a long period of time. We've upgraded the switching capabilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2822.00-2823.14: We're the only... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2823.16-2836.14: Well, I shouldn't say the only one. I've heard other people are working on one, but we are shipping a combo card, which is the XGS 10 gig and standard 2.5 gig within the same card profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2836.18-2839.22: Which is unique in that customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2839.80-2844.34: And getting a lot of traction because people don't want to have to go out and replace infrastructure if they don't have to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2845.13-2853.49: When I talk about the SDX, there's just nothing else out there. Completely disaggregated. It is the next generation system that people have been talking about for five or six years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2853.83-2858.24: It's actually now out in the market. We've actually shifted to paying customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2858.64-2867.47: It is what has been selected by pretty much every tier one that we have won in relation to POND, and we think there's nothing else that will touch it right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2868.35-2877.56: There are people that are kind of trying, or are reacting to it, but we think we have a good headway in the R&D that we've put into it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.38-2881.66: That's greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2883.02-2890.95: You. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2893.69-2899.04: Good morning uh... Got to a lot of my questions on the last one there uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2899.06-2904.40: But I will say that actually Nokia made the same comment this quarter with regard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2904.86-2905.89: I can believe it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2906.85-2908.31: By the ring finger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2908.49-2915.16: Fiber equipment copper in their access to know so that would seem to be well what comment were you talking about? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2916.16-2920.94: I was talking about the SDX. I was talking about what they were doing, talking about their disaggregated solution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.00-2924.02: Okay, I see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2924.10-2932.39: Little competitive intensity there. But that does suggest there's an industry-wide trend toward copper going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2932.41-2935.58: Thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2936.00-2941.82: I want to follow back up on the tier 3 comment. That $50 million, that's a quarterly number? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2943.02-2950.97: That he gave for the size of the 203, but okay. So, well, yeah, that's interesting. And-. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2952.57-2962.50: And that would make it your largest segment if you look at international US tier 3, tier 2, and tier 1 by some distance actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2963.24-2968.73: You're obviously seeing good growth there and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2969.29-2975.54: Most of which would seem to imply something on the order of kind of a, I don't know, 30% year-over-year decline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2975.60-2982.08: Among us tier ones or you know other parts of the business that are domestic based and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2982.66-2987.43: I'm guessing that may be a function of the COPPA programs that you referenced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2988.25-2997.42: You know, is that about right? And what does it take to kind of, you know, will it take the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow or how are you looking at that part of your business? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2998.96-3000.52: So I don't think it's tier one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3000.62-3008.11: I think in tier twos and tier threes on a year-over-year basis we've done good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3008.13-3013.11: That we had last year was predominantly on a comp basis, was predominantly Tillex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3014.37-3022.22: And so we had a large copper-based program going on with them that was tens of millions a quarter, and it just completely stopped. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3022.88-3027.45: So the hole that you're talking about in the North American market is Tomex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3028.07-3036.82: It's not the US carrier base and that was very much a copper based vector BDSO solution that they're rolling out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3038.62-3040.00: I think I just answered your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3043.52-3052.41: The end part and the last one for me is you know as you think about your potential international growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3052.43-3054.47: Next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3054.83-3063.48: I'd obviously should the tier threes continue to grow, you know, 60% maybe they could keep up with that rate of growth, I assume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3063.50-3070.17: For planning purposes, you know you model some slowing in that tier three growth rate despite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3070.19-3073.23: You know, are off ramping up and some other positive drivers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3073.53-3076.74: Just to begin with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3076.78-3084.94: And can we assume that from an international standpoint, you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3086.99-3093.97: That is a really good question that I don't have an answer for you today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3094.51-3103.80: So the thing about the tier threes is not just, let me just say all carriers, because it's broader than traditional tier three carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3104.30-3110.71: But the thing about these carriers is the growth rate through the year has been increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3111.79-3120.00: And I don't see a change in next year. So you're going to have two quarters of growth before these, you know, the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3120.28-3124.88: Really, we have one mammoth tier one in Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3125.07-3128.23: It's going to start, that's going to be all incremental. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3128.69-3132.09: And more that eclipse. Now there are other activities going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3132.33-3141.66: Process going on in Australia, carriers like Orange, who we announced an award with,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3142.54-3145.35: Vodafone, all of the telephonica. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3145.97-3152.19: Which is of course not just in Europe but in Brazil. All of those have got processes that are in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3152.21-3156.30: Or where they're coming towards a decision. But those will carry, those are really... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3156.50-3160.00: And if you think they don't get awarded until next year, they're a year away from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3160.14-3166.89: So the real mammoth new incremental piece is a new customer for us that's deploying the STX next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3167.45-3170.39: And it'll just be starting around the half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3170.89-3178.28: So I could absolutely envision next year where the tier 3 is actually the close it on a pure growth dollar basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3180.04-3186.97: But I don't know that for a fact. We'll have to get into the year and really see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3187.29-3191.51: Art off will start around the turn of the second half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3191.71-3197.28: But really for it to be material, it's going to take some time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3197.38-3204.84: I don't see that as this huge kind of wave of things coming in the second half of next year. I think it just starts to ramp up from there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3208.25-3217.84: I appreciate all that. Yeah, these alt-carriers, if they keep the momentum they have right now, the US could be stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.72-3227.89: Okay, so thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and we look forward to the call next quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3230.55-3233.17: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
