asr:0: OUTPUT 451.55-456.68: Given the nature of PVR and given the clinical site delays caused by COVID-19,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 456.80-463.86: The progress of guard has been slow, although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 465.33-469.09: As many of you know, there is no approved therapy for PVR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 469.71-475.76: And ADX-2191 has received orphan drug and fast-track designations from the FDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 477.96-486.27: ADX-2191 is also the subject of our new clinical program in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, or PVRL.

asr:0: OUTPUT 515.76-516.86: Turning to our systemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.90-526.57: We are very excited about ADX629, which to our knowledge is the first systemically available RASP inhibitor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 527.13-532.13: The clinical testing of which represents the first time systemic RASP inhibition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 532.15-539.98: Has been assessed clinically, marking an exciting new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 541.02-546.97: An IND has been filed with the FDA for phase two clinical testing of ADX629. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 547.33-554.79: In patients with COVID-19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 554.96-558.38: Clinical development is expected to begin this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.92-569.19: In an animal model of cytokine storm, ADX629 demonstrated a broad and highly statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 569.23-577.84: Including TNF-alpha interferon gamma and IL-17, while upregulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 578.92-585.09: The data suggests that RAS inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.11-591.97: Which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.79-601.90: In the fourth quarter of this year, we also expect to initiate clinical trials of ADX629 and psoriasis, an autoimmune disease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 601.92-605.11: And atopic asthma, an allergic disease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 605.99-620.92: In combination, trials in COVID-19 psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation, and the results of the trials will characterize the immune-modulating activity of ADX629 and RASP inhibition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 620.94-622.16: More generally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 624.70-628.89: Switching to ADX1612, our novel HSP90 inhibitor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 629.59-636.34: Enrollment has been completed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 2 udario trial in ovarian cancer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 637.56-649.63: Regarding the ADX 1612 COVID-19 program, consistent with FDA feedback, additional preclinical antiviral testing of ADX 1612 against SARS-CoV-2,.

asr:0: OUTPUT 662.30-668.67: We plan to update on the ADX 1612 COVID program by the end of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 672.89-678.80: We approach the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 678.86-687.49: Enhancing our flexibility with recent common stock sales to two healthcare-focused funds, Perceptive Advisors and Divinity Partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 688.45-698.12: These transactions raised gross proceeds of approximately $19.5 million, completing our previously announced at-the-market offerings program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 699.06-710.75: We expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through 2022, including potential reproxilap approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.91-716.70: Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Josh for the financial review. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 721.10-726.99: Thanks Todd. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we reported a net loss of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 727.01-734.05: $7.5 million compared with a net loss of $13.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.80-743.96: Net loss per share was $0.25 for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with $0.49 for the same period in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.09-752.97: Losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs, as well as from general and administrative expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.53-764.26: Research and development expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with $10.7 million for the same period in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 765.02-774.39: The decrease of $5.8 million is primarily related to a reduction in clinical and preclinical development, manufacturing, and personnel costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 776.28-785.25: General and administrative expenses were $2.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with $3.1 million for the same period in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 786.63-795.62: The decrease of $900,000 is due to lower personnel related costs, including stock based compensation and other miscellaneous administrative costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 797.36-799.26: In the second quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.28-807.89: Total operating expenses were $7.1 million compared with total operating expenses of $13.7 million for the same period in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 810.27-817.92: As of June 30, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $66.2 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.72-821.24: Subsequent to June 30, 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.26-831.69: $25.2 million in cash was received from at the market offering program sales to perceptive advisors, divinity partners, and other investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.95-840.98: Based on current operating plan, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of June 30, 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 841.32-849.67: Plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the end of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 849.73-856.12: Including potential NDA approvals for Reproxilab in dry disease and allergic conjunctivitis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 856.54-862.40: Assuming positive clinical trial results and planned NDA submissions, acceptances, and approvals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.98-868.31: Use of cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities are also expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 868.33-881.08: To include the continuation of part one of the phase three guard trial in PVR and phase two clinical testing of ADX629, an orally administered RASP inhibitor in inflammatory diseases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.02-884.40: Now I'll turn the call back to Todd for closing comments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 891.23-896.56: Thanks, Josh. We have a number of milestones planned for the second half of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 897.46-903.26: And look forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 904.32-914.27: Looking at our IR calendar, next week we'll be presenting at the BTIG Virtual Biotechnology Conference and Wedbush-Packrow Virtual Healthcare Conference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 915.32-921.28: These events will be webcast. Please check the events and presentation section of our website for details. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.42-928.11: We always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other upcoming events. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.93-939.96: As always, we remain committed to executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.64-945.02: With that, Josh, Dave, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 945.85-952.73: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. That is star one to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 953.29-956.74: Your first question comes from the line of Luis Senn with Cantor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 958.72-961.12: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 961.54-963.16: So first question I have for you is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.26-970.37: Could you get into more detail on how significant the FDA's recognition of RAS as a sign for dry eye disease? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 970.39-974.55: Is and what that means for you in terms of potential approval and market opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 975.22-984.38: And then the second question I have for you is on your COVID trials. How adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of COVID? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 985.00-986.47: And then how's enrollment gone? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 986.49-995.32: And then my last question here is you noted that there's been some headwinds to clinical trial progression due to COVID. Can you give more color on which trials may be impacted here? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.32-1007.11: Good morning, Louise, and thanks for your excellent questions. The raft development is a truly transformative for Aldera. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1008.71-1015.38: RASP is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1016.10-1021.90: To our knowledge, no company has ever therapeutically addressed RAS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1022.04-1032.41: And yet, RASP represents a very broad-based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many, many diseases, not only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1032.49-1037.22: Ocular diseases such as dry eye disease, but also systemic diseases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.70-1047.19: So for all those reasons, we were thrilled about the FDA's decision to classify RASP as an objective sign of dry eye disease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1047.21-1051.17: Which as you know is an inflammatory condition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1051.87-1073.69: What it means practically for the company is that the ongoing clinical trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of RAS should be likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism of Reproxilab and our other RASP inhibitors is the direct inhibition of RASP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.75-1077.26: These compounds bind covalently to rat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1077.34-1088.97: So what we're really measuring is a chemical reaction in vivo, and in this case, in the tear fluid of patients that have been administered Ruproxilab. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1090.13-1099.64: In all that leads us to believe that we'll be in a position to file an NDA for dry disease next year as we have previously announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1101.08-1105.05: Regarding the COVID trial design,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.23-1109.81: We anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.85-1115.68: 30 patients, I think they'll likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1116.38-1120.08: At this point, we have not included adaptive design. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1120.46-1124.18: I think the nature of the results of these first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1124.20-1137.04: Trials will help us determine subsequent clinical testing, which is obviously going to be much more significant if there are positive results from the preliminary outputs that we have here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1138.16-1150.69: Enrollment hasn't started. The IND has been filed for 629. As I mentioned on the call today, 1612 is the subject of further in vivo investigation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1150.71-1164.58: In COVID that is being performed by NIAID. And we're absolutely thrilled about NIAID's decision to test ADX1612 on our behalf. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1166.61-1171.79: The COVID impact, as you mentioned, Louise, across the industry has been significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.83-1177.10: The one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.12-1183.58: By COVID-19 as the guard trial, the phase three guard trial for PBR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1184.56-1198.18: What seemed to have happened during the peak of COVID cases back in March, April, May, and so forth, was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1198.24-1201.44: Despite vision changes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1201.46-1210.85: Despite losing sight, the number of patients coming in was diminished. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1210.87-1212.43: During that time frame. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.89-1221.64: And furthermore, many clinical sites, as you know, simply did not have research staff, which were considered for a while to be non-essential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.46-1228.61: Such that it was difficult, if not impossible in some cases, to enroll patients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1229.49-1239.04: However, the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline, we do not seem to be have been overtly affected by COVID in terms of enrollment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1239.88-1248.99: The dry eye program was largely under discussion with the FDA during the peak number of cases in the spring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.83-1257.04: The allergy program, the phase three allergy program, was on a planned hold because of pollen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1257.26-1266.21: As you know, you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambient pollen, and we expect the Invigorate program to reinitiate again in the fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.47-1275.56: So we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other clinical programs, we relative to the impact of of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1280.94-1286.49: As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.71-1293.15: That is star one to ask a question. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Kim with Oppenheimer and Company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1295.24-1298.00: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1299.20-1305.03: I know it's early days, but as you think about establishing a proxile left action on RAS as a sign of dry eye,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.39-1310.53: We've had some discussion with investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess this activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.83-1319.34: Can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four-week time points from a trial perspective, disease perspective, and labeling perspective? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1322.02-1325.27: Right, good morning, Justin, and good to hear from you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1326.69-1334.67: The as I highlighted in my comments this morning, the potential range of dosing duration for the rats trials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1334.83-1344.20: Is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the more chronic or subchronic end, which reflects the phase IIa trial. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1344.38-1349.23: That is the data in our corporate deck showing that after 28 days of administration of approx lab. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.79-1355.76: It was a highly statistically significant reduction in RASP levels as measured by ELISA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1356.80-1362.28: I want to spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure rafts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1362.44-1370.91: Wraps exist in our body in two forms, so-called free wraps that are sort of floating around, and then wraps that are bound to proteins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1372.13-1375.36: The ELISA measures RAP bound to protein. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.80-1381.08: And as you know, ELISA is an antibody-mediated detection assay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1381.10-1388.45: The reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound RASP is that when RASP bind to proteins, they're antigenic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.69-1395.03: And form antibodies, in some cases antibodies against cell proteins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1395.58-1401.20: So the ELISA measures bound rafts, and bound rafts generally accumulate over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1401.54-1407.07: Which is why in the phase 2a study over 28 days we used the ELISA to assess RASP levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1407.77-1413.99: On the other end of the spectrum, regarding one to two day or acute dosing of Viproxilab,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1414.41-1418.36: We think that techniques such as LC and MAP, MAP-SPEC,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1418.38-1427.59: Might be more relevant to assessing RAS because there we'd be looking at pre-RAS levels that would change acutely following dosing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1428.11-1436.28: So somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.14-1439.06: We will end up validating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1439.08-1448.59: The precise technique and then establishing protocol design for the first of the RAS studies to begin shortly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.33-1452.31: Okay, great, got it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.35-1459.70: And maybe then how do you think about dosing regimens to be investigated and have you had conversations with the FDA on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.72-1468.27: Whether you'd have to do QID or BID, just to appreciate that you would be tapering and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1468.29-1470.73: Disease state eventually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.69-1482.04: Right, and that gets back to the first part of your question. How might the clinical community perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimens? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.62-1489.83: First of all, I think that signs of diseases, including dry eye disease,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1489.85-1495.44: Are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.86-1505.03: I do not believe, certainly in the case of dry eye disease, that either physicians or patients are particularly worried about signs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.53-1510.77: Patients do not wake up in the morning thinking, I wonder what my Shermer test is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1511.13-1513.33: I wonder what my corneal stain is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1513.47-1522.10: And so forth. Instead, we view signs, and I think most patients and physicians view signs, as regulatory milestones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1522.54-1528.41: So the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs, I think, is a lot less important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1529.71-1532.53: In this case, for one to two doses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1532.57-1538.80: Day, the one to two day dosing paradigm, you're thinking of a limited number of doses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1538.82-1542.66: For the 28-day dosing paradigm, I would expect we would dose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1542.68-1546.89: QID, which is the first phase of our induction maintenance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.91-1555.54: Dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the phase 3 renewed trial back in December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1556.36-1564.18: In terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for Reproxilab in general, in terms of treating patients,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.42-1573.67: I think that the induction maintenance paradigm established with Renew over 12 weeks really sets the tone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1573.69-1584.94: And more precisely the label for how the drug will be used. And that is a QID dosing initially followed by BID dosing for the maintenance phase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1586.39-1590.35: OK, that's really helpful. Maybe just a clarification question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.57-1598.76: I know in the press release it says that there's going to be a dry NDA filing by the end of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1598.96-1603.70: Is the current thinking still to continue onward with the concurrent filing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1603.76-1609.61: I know later it says that ACs also going to be filed. Just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them to gather still. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.39-1617.70: Our current thinking is that both will be filed together, pending positive clinical data, of course. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1618.46-1625.35: It turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.67-1633.03: The safety studies, the efficacy studies, the timeline for filing the NDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.47-1639.58: All of those seem to overlap for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1640.62-1659.62: Would suggest that a concurrent NDA is perhaps the best regulatory strategy, but of course, we'll have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent NDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1659.78-1668.27: We really do like the concurrent NDA paradigm, however, because of the overlap between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.83-1671.93: It seems to be about a 50% overlap such that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1671.95-1679.10: About half of the patients with dry eye disease complain of ocular itching and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complain of dryness. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.60-1691.33: And a single compound that could treat both diseases or is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to physicians but also to patients as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.83-1693.93: Right, right. That makes a lot of sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.69-1700.74: My last question is just on the safety study, is there an expectation for what the size and scope? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1700.76-1704.70: Duration as well as number of patients you would anticipate for it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1707.05-1709.37: Right, so dry eye disease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.87-1718.64: My current understanding is that the FDA generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.06-1733.09: However, based on other sponsors' interactions with the agency, we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1733.95-1739.64: So what happens is most sponsors will over enroll. They'll begin with more than 100 patients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1739.78-1744.88: Such that they have 100 completers at 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1745.73-1754.61: And to our knowledge, the safety trials are fairly standard in dry eye disease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1755.66-1763.50: I will say, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we've tested well over a thousand patients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1764.26-1766.93: We have seen no safety signals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1767.53-1775.05: No changes in intraocular pressure, no retinal findings, no aberrant corneal findings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1775.62-1785.95: Or any other safety signals that would suggest that there has been an issue with Reproxellab dosing in any patient that's received drugs so far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1787.89-1790.27: Again and I'll hop back into Qt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1792.65-1797.50: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Dr. Brady for closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.86-1809.25: Well, thank you all again for joining us today. As always, we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a nice day. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1810.97-1816.96: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. 
asr:0: END
