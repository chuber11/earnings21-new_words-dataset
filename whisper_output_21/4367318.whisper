asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 2.66-7.49: Welcome to the Acceler-X Second Quarter 2020 conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 8.35-16.78: This call is being webcast live on the events page of the investor section of Acceler-X's website at acceler-x.com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 17.90-23.52: This calls the property of AccelerX and any recording, reproduction, or transmission of this call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 24.42-33.39: Without the express written consent of Acceler-X is strictly prohibited. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 34.25-41.16: You may listen to a webcast replay of this call by going to the Investor section of AccelerX's website. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 42.72-49.37: I would now like to turn the conference over to Rafi Asadourian, Accelerix Chief Financial Officer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 52.85-62.44: Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Earlier today, we announced our previously previewed second quarter 2020 financial results in a press release. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 63.22-70.09: This press release and the slide presentation accompanying this call are available in the investors section of our website. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 71.47-78.52: With me today are Vince Angotti, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Pam Palmer, our Chief Medical Officer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 80.88-88.61: Before we begin, I'll remind listeners that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 89.73-97.46: These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of AccelerX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 99.10-107.53: Please refer to our press releases in addition to the company's periodic, current, and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 107.55-111.75: For a discussion of the risks associated with such forward-looking statements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 112.21-114.19: I'll now turn the call over to Vince. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 116.16-123.86: Thank you, Rafi, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy, and we certainly appreciate you joining our call today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 125.49-135.18: On today's call, we'll describe the progress we've made toward achieving our strategic objectives of one, advancing the use of Dissuvia throughout the Department of Defense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.14-141.42: Two, expanding our business in large customer channels through partnerships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 142.40-149.23: Three, dedicating our internal sales team to the hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 149.31-153.59: And four, in licensing or acquiring additional products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 155.10-161.56: Objectives one and two allow for near-term growth without a significant Acceler-X commercial investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 162.36-166.99: While objectives three and four will take a bit more time, but are expected to have a significant return. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 168.39-175.36: We've made solid progress, both in the second quarter and more recently, towards achieving these strategic objectives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 175.38-180.70: And building our foundation for growth despite the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 182.54-190.53: This progress is highlighted by our successful milestone C approval in April that opens the door for purchases from the U.S. Army. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 190.55-202.34: As well as our recent distribution and promotion agreement with Zimmer Biomat for Dysuvia for the management of acute pain in adults during dental and oral surgeries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 204.46-210.59: Now as mentioned on our last call, in 2Q we received Milestone C approval with the U.S. Army. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 210.61-219.94: For de-Suvius placement in all of the US Army sets, kits, and outfits, or SKOs, associated with future deployments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 220.66-227.97: This approval was the high case in our internal projections with preliminary expectations and initial stocking orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 227.99-234.03: From the US Army, SKOs alone, will approximate $30 million over the next three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 235.34-246.35: We expect to know more about initial year orders for Army SKOs in the third quarter as the Department of Defense is going through its budgeting process for its fiscal year that begins on October 1st. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 247.57-256.64: In addition, the Department of Defense publicly communicated a notice of intent to contract for up to 12,200 boxes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 256.66-261.98: Or 122,000 Dissuvia single dose applicators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 262.00-268.69: Which we will expect to be ordered in the third quarter of this year after the request for proposal is issued and closed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 269.49-276.42: Now this is in addition to any SKO purchases which we expect will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 279.02-286.49: We also anticipate the SUVIA to be approved on the Joint Deployment Formulary, or JDF, in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.65-294.65: This approval will be another significant milestone as it expands access to the Suvi throughout the other branches of the military. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 295.90-301.70: And while the US Army represents approximately 60% of the expected deployment opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 302.06-306.67: There's still a sizable market from the other military branches upon JDF approval. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 308.15-314.45: The JDF approval also expands the opportunity for purchases throughout the network of military treatment facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 314.47-320.32: Several of which have already adopted Dysuvia on formulary and are using it in various treatment settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 322.44-327.71: The DoD opportunity is one strong pillar that will support the Suga's sales growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 327.73-335.10: Which is attained with a small infrastructure of just a few account managers and is therefore a profitable avenue for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 336.74-347.09: Similarly, we announced our exclusive promotion and distribution partnership with Zimmer Biomet for Dysuvia in the dental and oral surgery space outside the hospital setting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.73-357.94: This partnership allows us to access the large dental and oral surgery market of an estimated 7.5 million annual procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 357.98-361.64: Without additional investments in our commercial infrastructure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.14-370.41: Zimmer Biomed Dental Division is a leader in the dental implant space and has over 250 sales representatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 370.45-378.70: With established relationships who regularly visit dental and oral surgery customers, which should accelerate the suvi's introduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 379.48-383.10: Something we could not have done or attained without an entrenched partner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 384.88-391.39: Importantly, the COVID restrictions in oral surgery offices have largely been lifted, allowing access for sales representatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 392.17-401.34: So we're very excited about the prospects of this strategic partnership, as is Zimr-Biamet, who believes the Suvya will provide them with a differentiated offering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 401.36-403.96: From which dental and oral surgeons will greatly benefit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 405.77-412.35: The training of the Zimmer Biomath Dental Sales Representatives is currently being organized and will take time to cover the entire sales force. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 412.81-421.18: We expect some initial benefits from this agreement in the fourth quarter this year and we anticipate sales to pick up primarily in Q1 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 422.60-432.19: As this is the second part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with minimal XLRX investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 434.85-442.90: Looking forward, we see similar opportunities where customers in large specialty markets outside the hospital and ASCs can be educated on the benefits of Dysuvia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 442.92-446.81: Through companies that already have a presence in those spaces. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 447.67-454.89: Examples of such opportunities are plastic surgery procedures, fertility procedures in ambulance and other emergency medical services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 456.26-464.22: And unlike many hospital products such as anti-infectives or critical care products, Distributed provides a different value proposition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 464.24-468.51: And that it can be broadly used across many different medically supervised settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 469.57-479.78: Successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the second pillar and support to see the sales growth with minimal XLRX investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 481.90-489.05: Our existing account managers remain focused on delivering long-term value from hospital and ambulatory surgery customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 490.21-496.42: These customer segments often take longer to penetrate due to lengthy review periods and complexities in P&T scheduling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 497.30-506.11: We were slowed by COVID in the second quarter as access to hospitals and ASCs was restricted by states and institutions, each of which managed access differently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 507.33-511.73: But recently, access has improved versus the March to June time frame. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 512.49-520.72: And while restrictions still exist, we're seeing some recovery, highlighted by July being our largest month of demand by end users to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 522.62-529.33: During this time, we've also had some exciting hospital system wins, which we expect will provide some benefit in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.87-535.46: As they begin to place orders after they incorporate the Suvia into their protocols and medical information systems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 536.76-544.90: One of these wins was a recent expansion to all hospitals within a system after initially being approved at just one location and with use limited to general surgery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 546.05-549.75: After reviewing data from the initial trial use of the SUVIA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 549.77-552.65: Which illustrated both patient and economic benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 552.67-560.94: The P&T Committee reconvened and approved the studio for formulae system-wide, including its associated ASCs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.96-565.09: With expanded use to all settings within the hospital, including the trauma service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 566.57-569.33: Is a perfect example of how we see dysphoria being adopted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 570.19-575.84: We continually hear from our physician customers about the benefits they observe in their patients with dysphoria. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 575.86-581.98: And importantly, gathering the real-world data is key to demonstrating these advantages to other healthcare systems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 583.22-592.49: In fact, we're excited that data providing evidence of these benefits will be published soon, including one manuscript that was recently accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed anesthesia journal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.63-602.00: The economic benefits of distributing to the hospital and the reduction in use of intravenous opioids and other medications will be evident from these upcoming publications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 603.14-608.51: We expect this data to have a favorable impact commercially as healthcare providers will find the irrelevant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 608.53-613.39: Real-world data to illustrate why this UVA should be used over some current standards of care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 614.81-621.54: As we've said before, the acceptance of the Suvya on the formula is an eventual adoption into protocols as a process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.00-625.67: But based on the real-world results from healthcare practitioners using Dysuria. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 626.27-632.63: We remain confident that Distributeable will become a key treatment for the management of acute pain in medically supervised settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 633.39-639.66: Again, changing the standard of care takes time, but we believe healthcare professionals are just now beginning to realize the benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.82-650.03: I'll now hand the call over to Rafi to take you through the financials. Thank you, Vince. We continue to remain prudent with our cash as we launch Vesuvia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 650.85-661.04: We ended the second quarter with $43.7 million in cash and short-term investments, which represents a change of $9 million from the first quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 662.16-671.77: Our net cash outflow for the quarter was driven mainly by our $7.3 million of cash operating expenses, or combined R&D and SG&A expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 671.79-677.36: Excluding stock-based compensation, or $8.4 million including stock comp. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 679.30-687.79: The operating expenses in the quarter included a net benefit of $0.5 million from the receipt of a breakup fee from the Tetra phase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 687.81-693.59: Acquisition net of expenses incurred related to the transaction in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 695.03-704.70: This compared to $11.2 million of cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2019, or $12.5 million, including stock-based compensation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 706.29-710.19: Decrease in operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 710.21-717.82: Was primarily due to a reduction of $1.9 million in DeSuvia-related commercialization expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.42-722.24: And a $1.7 million reduction in personnel costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 724.20-734.09: We continue to focus on investing in the areas that will have the most positive impact on the launch and remain prudent in our overall cash spending. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.82-744.22: Revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were $2.9 million, compared to $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.39-758.38: Approximately $2.6 million of the revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2020 was attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to our collaboration agreement with Grunenthal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 760.58-762.62: Our high volume packaging line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 762.64-771.49: That is expected to be installed and operational at our contract manufacturer early next year has been delayed due to travel restrictions from COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 772.71-778.56: We hope these restrictions will be eased later this year, paving the way for final acceptance of the equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.42-785.67: Which will significantly reduce our cost of production once commercial production is running on this line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 787.23-793.07: To meet the timing of volume demands from the DoD as well as commercial customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 793.09-799.64: We are evaluating alternatives to accelerate final acceptance tests from the equipment manufacturer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 801.88-812.55: Looking forward to the rest of the year, we are expecting an initial order from the DOD as indicated in their Notice of Intent to Contract, which will be converted to an RFP for Dissuvia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 814.11-820.58: In addition, an initial stocking order for Army sets, kits, and outfits is expected in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.92-832.27: We have reduced our 2020 quarterly cash operating expenses, which are now expected to range from $8 to $9 million, excluding stock-based compensation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.29-836.54: Or $9-10 million including stock-based compensation for the rest of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 838.76-848.69: Finally, we remain in discussions with our potential out-licensing partner for DeZubio in Europe and hope to have more to report here in the coming months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 850.53-858.60: We are also in discussions with potential US collaboration partners around marketing and distributing Dissuvia to other specialty markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.62-863.06: Such as plastic surgery or fertility services in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 864.20-872.39: In addition, we remain in active discussions on in-licensing and acquiring assets that are complementary to our existing portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.41-875.70: With the potential to add significant value to the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.24-882.38: Finally, we are still evaluating the timing of our Zalviso NDA resubmission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.40-890.05: Which we delayed pending further guidance from the FDA regarding a potential new opioid product approval framework. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 891.69-898.96: We hope to have more details on these opportunities in the near future. With that, let me turn the call back over to Vince. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 899.84-908.95: Thanks, Rafi. So to summarize, we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the DoD and with the Zimmer Biomatte Dental Partnership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 909.93-914.75: Leveraging this success while continuing our push into the hospital and ASC markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 914.77-922.72: As we're able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of the Suvia with real-world data will generate long-term value for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.56-928.61: As you previously heard, the early feedback from the healthcare practitioners dosing Dysubutis positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.17-933.91: We look forward to the publications about the data showcasing Dysuvia in the perioperative setting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 935.06-938.74: I'd now like to open the line up for any questions you might have. Operator? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.00-948.19: Thank you. And we will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star and then one on your touchtone phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 948.91-953.67: If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.53-958.12: To withdraw your question, please press star and then two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 958.96-961.98: At this time, we will pause for a moment to assemble our roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 965.41-971.07: Our first question today will come from Brandon Foulkes of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.17-977.40: I think that's the end of questions and congratulations on all the progress in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.94-980.70: Just three for me today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 981.88-988.67: Firstly, could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for the Zimit deal? I think you talked about 7 million procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 989.57-994.01: How many of those procedures do you think are suitable for dysthoia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 994.63-1004.66: And then currently, where are you seeing use in Jaisuvia? Any new areas during the quarter, placing orders or seeing use of the product? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1005.37-1009.97: And then lastly, sorry, I'm going to ask the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1010.07-1017.24: I know you sort of insinuated that you were up there just down the line, but with the recent opioid approval,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1017.32-1020.98: Does this change your thinking on Zalviso or what can you say at this point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.00-1022.00: Stage. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1024.32-1028.79: So I'm going to have Pam answer those questions. The first one is the Zimbra Biomed opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1029.49-1036.86: Just in general, we said about 7.5 million procedures eligible for disuse. But Pam, maybe you can give examples of what those procedures are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1038.64-1039.64: Sure, yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1039.66-1049.09: Third molar extractions, otherwise known as wisdom teeth extractions, dental implants, bone grafting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.25-1053.77: There's a number of dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.79-1060.98: By oral surgeons and dentists that use IV opioids and we're really looking to replace IV opioids in that market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1061.38-1069.19: So, answering directly your question is all of those 7.5 million procedures are addressable dysphoria procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1069.25-1071.41: It's not all dental and oral procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1071.97-1075.74: That's the estimate of what dysphoria can be addressing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1077.18-1086.71: The second component of that question, Brandon, if you recall, was where is DeSueva currently being used? Again, I'll defer to Pam as she's been working with various specialists around the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1087.79-1091.59: Sure, Dissuvi is being used in... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.61-1101.10: Ambulatory surgery settings, it's being used in procedural suites, adjacent to physicians' offices. It's being used in emergency rooms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1101.24-1103.92: So we're seeing a lot of dysuvia use. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1103.94-1122.32: In short-term settings. Also, some interesting medically supervised settings, such as fertility clinics, which often have to do painful procedures and currently use IV opioids in that setting, they're finding Dysuvia to be a very nice non-invasive alternative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1124.46-1129.33: We also are seeing oral surgery typically as well as some ENT procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.07-1139.08: So again, medically supervised settings covers a wide swath of medical specialties and we're happy that they've seen the benefits of dysthovia in each of those different areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1139.50-1148.21: Sam, can you also comment briefly on how you're seeing the CVUs in the short-term settings, in particular for the same-day surgeries and the timing of the dose and why? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1148.95-1153.75: Yeah, the majority of folks using the Suvia now are giving it preoperative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1153.77-1162.88: About 15 to 20 minutes prior to incision as they know it takes 15 minutes to reach that sort of therapeutic concentration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.46-1168.09: And 90 to 95% of the time, they're using just a single dose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.67-1178.38: We know from our PK as well as our clinical trials that we get about three to four hours of analgesia with a single dose. And in those settings, that's really all they need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.70-1185.83: So it's looking like a very nice replacement for the IV injectable of clear liquid opioids with just a single dose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.55-1196.60: And I reiterate beyond what Pam said, we're spending our time as a company with our resources in the short term or the same day surgery settings within the hospital or ASCs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1196.62-1203.54: What Pam mentioned before regarding oral surgery, dental surgery use, there's plastic surgery use, there's fertility clinic use. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.28-1209.75: Those other uses really help reinforce our strategy because they're large. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1209.77-1217.66: They're diffused, they're not centralized. Our strategy to partner with others to penetrate those markets exactly as we did with Zimmer Biomet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1218.82-1228.19: That was component two of your question, Brandon. I think component three was Zalviso and PAM. You can comment on that one as well as we're continuing to study the regulatory parameters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1228.71-1238.68: Yeah, I think it's still early. We've not really had a definitive framework from the FDA yet on their evaluation of new opioid products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1238.82-1245.29: It's unclear whether all the theridine was approved under an old framework and sort of grandfathered in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1245.49-1251.59: And so we're really waiting for more clarity from the FDA and specifically the DAPT division on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1251.67-1257.18: On a specified framework to sort of evaluate new opioid submissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1257.88-1267.37: The good news in that approval is that they're clearly seeing and recognizing the importance of opioids in these medically supervised settings, and that continues to give us comfort moving forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.47-1270.75: Brandon, I hope that answered the three components of your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1272.03-1276.52: It does. Do you mind if I sneak one more and apologize? You just triggered something else. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.52-1282.88: Just in terms of the feedback you received from physicians using the product,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1284.36-1293.95: Is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice similar to what we saw in the clinical trials? I'm going to knock it from there, I promise. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1296.42-1301.16: Absolutely. The onset of action is very consistent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.92-1306.87: Again, the sublingual route of administration avoids the first path effect that you... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.89-1313.47: Meaning it doesn't go to the stomach and then have to be absorbed and metabolized by the liver, which makes it very erratic onset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1313.91-1323.50: That's why oral opioid medications don't really work quickly or that consistently. So from a sublingual onset standpoint, it is very consistent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.92-1327.83: And the duration of action is interesting. It's actually a little bit longer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1328.25-1335.84: And then, you know, our clinical trial, we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia when you're going up against placebo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.94-1339.52: You try to keep those studies quite clean. So in the real world setting... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1339.68-1351.37: You know, we've had reports that the duration of analgesia can even last beyond the three to four hours. And it has a very nice offset tail, meaning that it provides a very comfortable level of analgesia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1351.39-1353.55: Through to discharge with just that single dose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1354.83-1364.36: Yeah, I think the general feedback beyond what Pam said is that it's absolutely delivering on the messages we've communicated that onset, the duration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.42-1375.00: And as doctors have mastered their art with it, bringing it forward in the short-term surgeries and procedures has been the absolute key. Bringing it forward meaning when they dose it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.50-1385.07: And they're timing the PK to the acute pain to really maximize the product. And it's really allowing to use one dose, which I think has been the largest surprise to all of them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1386.11-1391.59: And if I could add, I think one of the most remarkable things we hear about is the lack of side effects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1392.99-1398.60: I mean, in the PACU, the importance, time to discharge is sort of a composite measure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1399.34-1404.48: You have to have your adverse events under control and you also have to have your pain under control to be discharged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.94-1412.21: So the thing that I love about sort of time to pack your discharge is it really is a way to look at both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.25-1417.44: And safety at the same time, as well as making sure when I say safety. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1418.24-1422.62: Your patients, including your elderly patients, don't have any cognitive impairment. And that's a huge part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1423.02-1426.45: So one of the things we're hearing back in spades from the customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.49-1432.39: Is that that preoperative dose is carrying them through the operation, through the PACU,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1432.41-1439.94: Many times additional medications are not required at all and they're able to discharge them more quickly because they do not have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1439.96-1445.05: The side effects from the typical IV injectable opioids that they're often seen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1447.87-1452.07: Very helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.95-1461.52: Thank you. Our next question today will come from Michael Higgins of Leidenberg-Salmon. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1464.18-1465.21: My questions have been asked. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.75-1474.73: Our next question today will come from Evan Seegerman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1476.16-1477.90: Thank you so much for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1478.72-1484.90: To follow up on the Zimmer Biomet deal, what feedback have you gotten from dentists regarding using the product in office? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.41-1492.61: Are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the necessary infrastructure that they would have to have by having the opioids? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1492.65-1497.22: In stock, you know, I know that they do use various drugs in the office, but just adding another one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.02-1500.52: And then you had mentioned business development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.82-1503.10: Any thoughts as to what you're looking for? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1503.12-1512.29: In terms of a target product profile or even more broadly speaking, you know, what type of patient population, how should we be thinking about that? Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.29-1524.06: Sure, well, relating to the oral surgeon, so we've never marketed to them that we sort of received a number of inbound queries when it first was approved because they saw the obvious benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1525.07-1536.20: We are only REM certifying and supplying it to oral surgeons and IV sedation dentists, so that means they already have approval. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1536.34-1544.92: And already have the locked C2 storage and all the necessary oxygen and medications to treat respiratory depression due to opioids. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.27-1549.49: These are very savvy surgeons who already know how to use IV opioids. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1549.51-1566.03: And they certainly see the advantage of a rapid onset and extended duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop their procedure and redose their IV opioids, which they typically have to do multiple times throughout a procedure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1566.05-1567.85: They clearly see the benefit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.91-1571.85: And that's again why Zimmer saw the benefit as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.09-1576.38: They know these surgeries very well and they know the benefit that a just stuvia can use. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.32-1588.47: Evan, just to reiterate, why go with XMR and we mentioned these other specialty markets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.43-1595.10: They're large markets, but we don't have a large enough sales force to penetrate like these partners have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1596.10-1599.48: As well as the relationships that they've built up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.00-1609.71: Compared to what we have. So we want to focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets with the partners that are already in these. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1609.73-1614.53: We're calling them specialty markets. They're specialty for us, but not for others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1614.57-1619.98: With partners that are already in that space with established relationships and with large sales forces. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1621.12-1629.13: And that leads into, I think, the second component of your question, Evan, which was target product profile as we look at business development opportunities moving forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.17-1631.77: So for us, the biggest key is efficiency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.79-1642.90: Meaning, oh, is the call patterns within these medically supervised settings where we currently deploy our resources? We want to keep them focused where they currently are. So whether it's the hospital or the AFC,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1642.92-1646.77: Or the anesthesiologist in the office suites, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1646.81-1649.69: We want to continue to target those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1651.09-1654.13: Area is less relevant for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1655.12-1664.00: It's more of where they are located for use of these products. Account overlap is critical and will be opportunistic on a moving forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.76-1674.71: One of the common themes through all that, other than the efficiency, is going to be something that's very late term or already on the market. We're not looking for long-term R&D projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1676.34-1677.94: Thank you so much guys, I appreciate the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.16-1685.67: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.77-1690.47: I'd like to turn the conference back over to Vincent Gladi for any closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.21-1696.66: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today and for your continued support of Acceler-X. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1697.34-1703.08: We feel we're very well positioned for future growth and we look very much forward to sharing more developments as they occur. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.64-1708.27: So please be safe and look forward to giving you updates as they happen. Bye. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1711.03-1717.78: The conference is now concluded and we thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. 
asr:0: END
