asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.41-1177.60: And we are excited about the continued growth opportunities as we expand our product portfolio to the hospitality market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.88-1185.15: Product innovation is also a hallmark of our success in the marketplace and provides a distinct competitive advantage for Cole.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.85-1197.62: We are excited about the demand transfer Live Smart Evolve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.78-1205.33: I recently introduced a line of sustainability fabrics featuring the use of recycled yarns along with the same stain resistant performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.87-1213.33: Looking ahead, while the business environment remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the coronavirus in China and beyond,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1214.23-1217.90: We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy with favorable results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1218.70-1222.10: We have a unique combination of innovative products, creative design. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.12-1230.67: A growing customer base across both residential and hospitality markets, and a global platform to support our business and meet changing customer demands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.87-1238.36: As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another solid performance in our Upholstery Fabrics business in fiscal 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1240.00-1247.97: Lastly, I'll comment on the results for Culp Home Accessories, which includes our e-commerce and finished products business offering bedding accessories and home goods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.29-1253.79: We have worked hard to refine our strategy and drive improved results for our home accessories segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1254.81-1258.42: Well, it's taking longer than we expected to reach our initial projections for this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1258.94-1265.39: We encourage by recent opportunities with new online marketplaces and business-to-business sales channels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.17-1273.25: We also remain dedicated to improving our performance on Amazon, which is a principal sales channel for our legacy e-commerce business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1274.37-1280.22: In tandem with these strategies, we are continuing to develop new products featuring colt mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1280.72-1285.61: And we were pleased with a very solid showing of the new products at the recent Las Vegas market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.73-1296.06: We remain optimistic about potential growth opportunities for Cole Pwn Accessories and the ability to leverage this new important sales channel to reach new customers for Cole. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.58-1300.98: Ken will now review the outlook for fourth quarter and we will then take some questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1302.26-1310.91: Importantly, our expectations for the fourth quarter assume the coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.93-1314.23: Which may affect each of the company's divisions to varying levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.06-1324.78: We are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for in the company's global pandemic disease contingency plan to protect our workforce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.43-1336.86: However, the potential impact of the coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point, given the fluidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain its spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1337.82-1344.78: Subject to those assumptions and limitations, we expect overall sales to increase slightly compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1345.65-1350.57: We expect mattress fabric sales to be slightly down compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1350.59-1355.86: Due to continuing market pressure and softness in our legacy business during the fourth quarter,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1356.10-1360.90: While operating income and margins are expected to increase slightly compared with the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1361.74-1368.31: In our post-year fabric segment, we expect fourth quarter sales and operating income in March to be slightly higher than the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.29-1375.38: In our home accessories segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be comparable to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1376.14-1378.82: We expect an operating loss for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1378.84-1386.73: But with significant improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter over quarter sequential improvement for this fiscal year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1387.77-1395.44: Consider these factors. The company expects to report pre-tax income for the fourth quarter in the range of $1.9 million to $2.4 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1395.46-1402.56: Excluding restructuring and related charges or credits, other non-recurring charges, and impairment charges, if any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1403.18-1410.69: Pre-tax income for last year's fourth quarter was $1.5 million, which included a non-recurring charge of $500,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.21-1415.82: Excluding this charge, pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of last year was $2 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1416.68-1424.72: Based on our current projection, capital expenses for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the $6 million to $6.5 million range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.23-1429.13: Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 8.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1429.97-1435.94: Additionally, free cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year's results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.74-1438.68: With that, we will now take your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1441.02-1450.57: Thank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.99-1456.58: Again, press star one to ask a question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1466.47-1469.39: Take our first question from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1470.93-1472.77: Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1476.00-1482.62: So I guess the things I wanted to talk about is maybe adding some fabric production capabilities in Vietnam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.76-1487.19: Maybe can we expand on what those capabilities would give you guys? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.21-1495.12: What's the strategy to participate more in what I guess we can call the Asia import market for mattresses back into the US? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1497.72-1499.34: This is Ilyas. I'll take that question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.94-1506.69: You have to go back a little bit as we think about both anti-dumping and tariffs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1507.97-1515.60: You know, it should feel like, you know, now we're not even talking about that anymore, but that was a pretty significant disruption over the last year of Section 301 tariffs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1515.70-1518.86: The rules for upholstery and mattress fabrics are quite different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1519.40-1524.84: So the reason we're looking primarily to establish fabric manufacturing in Vietnam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1525.35-1533.27: Is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant extra 301 tariff coming from China, as do mattress covers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1534.89-1544.06: Unlike furniture or upholstery fabric where we can ship fabric from China to Vietnam. To avoid a tariff, unless you make the full sun cover. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1544.08-1549.53: Fabric all the way to cover in Vietnam, you still pay the extra tariff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1550.05-1554.63: So for us, establishing in Vietnam is a risk management play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.73-1556.26: A cost-saving play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1556.36-1558.84: And certainly gives us the ability to make covers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1558.86-1569.27: That we can fulfill through Vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds that end up in the U.S. Or bring fabric and covers of our own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.29-1571.33: Back to us in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.89-1579.70: I hope that answers it. Yeah, that's very helpful. I was just curious from a competitive standpoint, once you get this operation set up,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1579.72-1587.59: Will those corresponding covers that you can now make in Vietnam be competitively priced to some of the covers that are already going on the imports? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.61-1589.97: Imported beds into the U.S. Today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1591.45-1599.76: Yes, sir, Bobby, we expect you. We've been very competitive with covers already, mattress covers that we're making through our Culp China platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.62-1601.78: Has been very competitive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.90-1605.19: And there are already opportunities materializing there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1605.29-1612.43: But to be more advantageous to deal with U.S. Care rules and costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.45-1617.68: Vietnam could be potentially more advantageous in certain cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1619.08-1625.81: Okay, and then secondly for me on the home accessories business, you talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the Amazon channel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.23-1636.18: So can you maybe expand a little bit on those strategies? And then secondly, is there a bigger opportunity to sell some of those finished products in retail locations? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1638.48-1644.06: Yes, sir. Bobby, those are really good questions to 1st, I'll touch on the Amazon part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1644.82-1654.79: When we first invested in home accessories, Amazon was the sole, or really the primary part of the business, up to 80% of the sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1655.70-1657.88: And we were really focused on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1658.68-1663.48: Since the time we've invested, it's become more costly to do business and to rank higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1663.50-1670.81: To Google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings of the cost more money than we might have expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1671.17-1678.22: So we've dialed back our offerings on Amazon to really what we consider our core most stable, most cost-effective products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.64-1682.22: And we're trying to do what we consider to be an appropriate level of advertising. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1682.72-1686.95: So what we have placed on Amazon today, we believe we can service well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1687.33-1693.87: It's a good quality product that should rank well and that we don't have to over advertise it and spend too much money to make it work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.35-1702.40: So we're anticipating Amazon being a significant, but more like a 50% share of our business and not such a heavy piece. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.28-1708.13: For certain, we have great opportunities in all of our accessory products on the B2B side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1708.87-1717.22: We have a lot of customers, roll pack betting customers that are looking for products to attack on and have additional sales accessories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.52-1723.84: We also had a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution, and that is working. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1725.13-1732.35: Sometimes it's never as fast as we want it to be because it takes time to get in the retail cycle, but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1734.13-1740.00: I appreciate you taking my questions, Dave. That was very helpful. Best of luck in the next quarter. Yes, sir. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1743.38-1752.35: Once again, that is star one to ask a question. If you find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two. Again, star one to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1753.63-1756.66: We'll take our next question from Paul Betts with Stiefel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1760.00-1761.06: Everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.16-1767.71: Continuing with Amazon, you mentioned some new sellers are violating terms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1768.09-1775.70: Can you explain what's going on there and maybe if that gets rectified you may see less competition? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1777.08-1781.76: Yes, sir. Well, Paul, thank you for the question. I'll take that, too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1782.76-1788.65: Basically what's happened since we first started with Amazon, and there's been a lot of stories in the press about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1789.27-1796.84: There have been times where primarily Chinese sellers have flooded the marketplace on commodity items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1796.86-1801.38: Mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialize in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1802.00-1808.57: And Amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you acquire five-star reviews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.13-1815.88: We have a lot of reviews that we've earned through steady, normal processes, selling items and getting reviews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1816.30-1821.24: It's not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.26-1828.97: And also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews, which we have found instances of all those things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1829.03-1832.97: And we have reported them to really high levels in Amazon and made some headway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1833.55-1842.04: So Amazon is working really hard to change their method, the way they rank suppliers. And I think in time that will get better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.32-1847.81: But it's a pretty long fight for someone like us to make a big impact really quick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1847.87-1853.97: But that's what we mean by terms of service violation. It's really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.48-1859.66: Okay, thanks. The tap X is reduced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1859.98-1866.81: Is that just to conserve cash or what areas did you lower that sum? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1868.13-1875.66: We looked at the year and given our cash position, we started prioritizing projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.28-1882.40: And so we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance CapEx, which is in that $6 million or so range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.20-1888.97: So when you look at where we're ending up, projected end up, and then looking forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1889.15-1899.22: We are going to, in this time of uncertainty, we are going to prioritize projects and as we said, keep a very close eye on our cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1899.24-1903.10: We will continue to invest in the business as we always have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.16-1909.93: We will have to monitor things closely and prioritize projects as they come along. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1912.09-1918.52: Lastly, there are of course margins in the mattress segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1919.46-1928.45: A little below our expectations down year to year. Is that just the disruptions from the holiday shutdown or is there anything else going on there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.71-1936.26: No, that's a good insight there. Obviously, the lower sales had an impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1936.72-1945.15: But there were a lot of moving parts with the shutdowns and all that in the quarter. And so that was the primary reason for the marshes being down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.47-1947.69: The lower sales and the other disruption as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1949.45-1951.01: Okay. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1953.13-1959.72: We'll take our next question from Marco Rodriguez with Stonegate Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.34-1963.64: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1966.93-1974.53: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the expansion activities that you're doing here in Vietnam and Haiti. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.89-1983.96: If you could just maybe place a timeline as far as when these capabilities will be there and then the cost associated with those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.61-1992.09: Yes, sir. Thanks for the questions, Marco. And expansions in Vietnam and Haiti. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.59-2002.00: Are both really targeted for the mattress fabrics business in terms of the expansion standpoint. We're already operating pretty significantly in Vietnam for our whole street. Cutting focus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2002.72-2003.74: And that's performing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2004.78-2011.09: Haiti, we started a two-pronged strategy, a really three-pronged strategy for mattress covers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.41-2019.74: We have our U.S. Business that is a prototyping and quick rollout and emergency recovery platform that works well for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.60-2030.47: Haiti is a very low cost opportunity that we see often a near sourcing potential. So we're able to drive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.13-2033.27: Significantly faster lead times in Haiti. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2033.71-2037.88: It's been a really resounding success for us so far, and we're just expanding the building. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2038.46-2041.84: So it's not a significant expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.94-2048.53: You know, we're just building some extra space and add some more sewing machines. Getting into cut and sew is not a heavy CapEx venture. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2049.31-2054.49: So, we would anticipate being in that plan and having additional capacity this summer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2054.61-2059.92: It's a pretty fast, pretty fast uprising there and we're excited about Haiti. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.06-2063.48: The good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2064.36-2070.35: And if it's shown in Haiti and comes back to the US, there's no duty on any of the products in or out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2070.87-2078.34: So very advantageous platform that should provide us with faster lead times if we forecast and store inventory at the right places. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2079.10-2084.94: Vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.31-2090.71: We'll start small, mainly focused on serving Asian customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2091.37-2100.42: And that's our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in Asia. And we can do that with both fabric or with a sun mattress cover. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2101.22-2104.38: If we need to, we also have the ability to bring some of that back to the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2105.67-2114.01: Not preferred on a lead time basis, but it could be good for cost. And we'll just do that on an as-needed basis, and we would avoid a Section 301 tariff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2117.48-2119.92: I think that is understood. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2119.94-2128.47: The service platform additions or enhancements that you are taking a look at in the new inventory management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2129.17-2136.54: Can you maybe expand a little bit more on what sort of impact, if any, you might see on the P&L and or the balance sheet with those? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2139.06-2141.54: And Alec can comment on the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.72-2145.71: Impact, but I'll tell you the way the reason we're thinking about it is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.75-2151.21: The mattress industry always for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2151.27-2157.80: Where we pretty much inventory, shift everything same day, and we still do that for a big part of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2157.86-2165.59: But as things have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components, lead times have gotten a little longer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.97-2174.73: So we've tried to then match our platform with all the multi countries that we're in, US, Canada, China, Haiti, Vietnam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2174.77-2176.80: And then our sourcing business in Turkey. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2176.88-2186.05: We want to bring lead times back down, even with that global strategy. So our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we've had recently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2186.17-2191.91: Shorten those lead times down so we're not caught with so much exposure on the water as market conditions change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.51-2197.06: So, we're just, our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2198.38-2203.46: Faster lead time to customers to make them happy, and then reduce our exposure for extra inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2205.03-2206.35: Yeah, Marco, this can and that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2206.69-2209.25: The extra inventory, we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2209.31-2214.21: We were expecting obviously a better quarter than we had, so we built up inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.23-2219.46: Those cells didn't materialize, but now with this new focus,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.74-2223.90: We should be able to get inventory down and keep it in line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2223.98-2230.75: More consistently, which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the 4th quarter, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.77-2242.40: We are excited about the new process and hopefully don't get back in a situation where we build up inventory in anticipation of sales that don't materialize. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2242.48-2243.82: So this is exciting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2243.94-2247.95: Move and one that we're anxious to get started. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2250.65-2253.91: And last quick question, it's kind of a difficult one here on guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2255.52-2264.52: You built in some sort of an impact for coronavirus, but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2265.09-2268.91: What does worsening conditions mean for you or look like? Are we talking... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2270.41-2272.57: Additional shutdowns in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2273.01-2280.18: As far as the risk is concerned, and I know that you also brought the fact that obviously consumer confidence in the US is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2280.20-2283.46: A big unknown at this dance right now.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2303.50-2309.83: You know, as you know, everybody reads what happens daily, the news comes out. And so right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2310.51-2316.06: Things are operating well in China, things are recovering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2316.82-2319.58: So we've got that news there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2320.00-2324.70: But things change daily, so given where we are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2324.72-2334.89: We expect a good quarter in the fourth quarter, but as I said, things can change quickly and we'll just have to wait and see.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2373.65-2382.74: One week delay in our China operation, a government mandated one week delay before we were able to get back to operating.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2396.40-2403.42: We've experienced minimal delays and disruptions to supply to our customer base as a result. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.84-2411.83: And so while it may remain a dynamic situation for sure and uncertainty, the current picture is.
