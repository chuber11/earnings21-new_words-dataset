asr:0: OUTPUT 187.21-194.53: Over the course of the third quarter it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly compared with the second quarter and exceed our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 195.01-201.64: We are encouraged by our recent performance given the challenges we continue to face from the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 202.54-206.47: I'll work over the past several months which has included reducing expenses,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 206.49-209.19: Adapting our operations to the current retail environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 209.21-217.82: And aggressively managing inventories has put the company in a much stronger financial position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.14-229.01: Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we saw a significant sequential uptick in cells through in June for both our protection and power categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 229.03-233.63: As several of our larger customers reopened their doors and resumed more normalized store operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 234.25-236.92: With some central weeks even exceeding last year's levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 237.66-241.78: This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 242.40-246.95: While our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced early in the pandemic,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 246.97-253.95: When much of the brick and mortar was closed it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 254.97-264.10: With respect to overall performance Q3 revenue came in at $150 million compared to $147 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 21%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 264.62-270.29: This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year over year decrease in revenue we reported in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 270.97-279.34: Despite the roughly 32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter of last year combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 279.36-282.26: We deliver the just EBITDA of $15 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 282.98-286.33: Thanks to cost-saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.53-291.43: Taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet but I wanted to share a few highlights. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 292.35-301.96: Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19, our accounts receivable, DSO, has improved compared to last year. Inventory declined compared to where we ended Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 302.58-310.09: We generated positive operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarter end net debt balance on a year over year and sequential basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 311.53-318.22: By taking quick decisive action back in April and more recently working closely with our retail partners on their store reopening efforts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 318.48-322.58: We have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 322.62-329.43: Ensuring the financial viability of the company and position ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organisation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 330.43-332.79: I now provide some additional color to our categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 333.43-340.76: Starting with protection, we continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy. For a few years now, our hero screen protector has been VisionGuard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 341.12-344.14: A product that reduces exposure to high energy visible blue light. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 344.22-348.29: That can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.99-351.35: We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 351.89-357.94: In addition, all Invisible Sheen screen protectors produced this year and beyond now also include antimicrobial technology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 358.36-363.10: This includes our entire lineup for the new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.06-368.29: Earlier this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital wellness strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 368.31-376.12: A UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9% of staph and E. Coli surface bacteria. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 377.00-386.43: Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our consumers and has led to increasing sell-through and greater shelf space with many of our accounts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 387.45-391.89: We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 392.15-397.96: Starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year and right through to the recent iPhone 12 launch. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 398.42-402.70: All Gear 4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 403.74-408.69: The combination of this enhancement benefit in Gear 4's differential DTO impact technology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 408.71-415.72: Is driving excitement amongst consumers, especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 416.54-420.84: With the new iPhone 12, Gear 4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 421.52-427.55: This expanded distribution accelerates the momentum in peer-4 brand and I'm excited to see it continue to grow through 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 428.99-436.10: In our power category, Mophie launched many exciting new products during Q3, including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.70-442.10: These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 442.78-445.91: In addition, last month we launched a new Morphe Juice Pack Connect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 446.37-449.67: This new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 449.81-458.96: Allowing users to easily charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 460.48-468.03: Our Halo brand continues to perform well on QVC, which has been a productive partnership and channel, particularly given the number of consumers spending more time at home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.59-474.45: Q4 is a busy time for our brands with QVC and HSN with a number of airings planned during the holiday period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 475.62-480.68: Looking ahead with the majority of our US partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue to improve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 480.70-485.81: Combined with solid direct to consumer trends, we feel optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 486.43-495.66: While there is still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behaviour this holiday season, including the effect on several countries in Europe that have recently implemented lockdowns,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 496.12-502.08: We believe we are well positioned to capitalise on demand regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.86-510.89: We are currently planning 4 quarter revenue to increase from 3rd quarter levels and continue improving on the year over year declines we have experienced the past 2 quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 511.21-514.61: Even as we're facing tough comparisons to last year's record Q4 sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.48-523.28: I am confident in the long term course we have set for the company. Our efforts around antimicrobial, UV sanitisation and blue light protection. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 523.40-528.61: Are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will enhance their digital wellness. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.17-538.18: We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home. We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 539.26-545.29: While it remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalise and what impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy and our industry,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 545.71-550.09: I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.75-557.18: This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin products and categories and simplify our core lines of business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 557.64-562.16: As a more nimble company Zag can better serve its retail partners and co-consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 562.40-570.95: Capitalise on the tailwinds from the multi-year rollout of 5G with the margin benefits from our brand and character consolidation and generate increased value for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 571.87-581.52: I will now hand the call over to Taylor. Thanks, Chris. Since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.96-586.57: I would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 587.23-592.69: Q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately 21% to $115 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.11-600.40: After exiting a very difficult second quarter, we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.42-603.28: And allow a more normal in-store shopping experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 603.72-609.03: That being said, the residual effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of the new Apple devices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.05-613.77: Which pushed some orders into Q4, made it a difficult year-over-year compare. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 614.31-623.78: Overall, we're pleased with the momentum and sell-through improvements we saw at retail, which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 623.80-625.31: To 115 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 626.25-630.75: Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to 33%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 631.35-640.84: There were a number of puts and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter, including a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds, which I'll discuss in more detail in a second. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 641.28-646.65: This benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.67-651.79: Along with the sale of excess inventory margins that were lower than our historical averages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 652.49-662.08: On the subject of duty refunds, in early August we received an exclusion notice that duties paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 662.66-667.15: We work closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to U.S. Customs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 667.59-673.89: This work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from China since late 2018, will continue throughout the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 674.43-683.06: Based on the work completed to date, we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 683.60-689.95: The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized in inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.97-692.15: And then sold in Q3 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 692.17-699.98: Was a net income statement benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 700.58-709.89: As I mentioned, there's still quite a bit of work left to do during the fourth quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 711.23-716.76: Q3 operating expenses decreased 29%, or approximately $12 million compared to last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 717.34-724.94: The decrease was due primarily to the various cost-cutting measures we implemented as a result of the expected COVID-19 impacts on demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 725.59-733.27: Over the last several months, we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 733.69-738.36: But we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 739.42-743.52: Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus $21 million in the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 744.04-749.79: The decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales and a reduction in overall gross profit margin for the reasons I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.19-753.95: These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.96-764.22: Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago, accounts receivable decreased 33% to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 764.74-771.03: However, our DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days. The quality of our receivables remains very good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 771.79-778.34: Inventory was $80 million compared to $94 million at the end of the first quarter, a reduction of approximately $14 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.88-785.25: During the third quarter we took a conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell-through, customer forecasts,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 785.27-789.15: And customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't overextend on inventory purchasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 789.83-797.92: As a result, we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increased demand at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 798.68-803.12: At this point, we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.58-808.91: But will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 809.93-816.78: Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter, we generated a third quarter operating cash flow of approximately $9 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 816.80-820.56: Compared to negative 11 million in cash from operations during the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.34-824.02: Net debt which is consolidated debt less cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 824.04-831.57: Decreased to $81 million compared to $97 million in Q3 last year and $85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.79-842.50: As we discussed on the last call, during April we amended our credit facility to increase the total amount available under the line of credit from $125 million to $145 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 842.96-846.05: This expansion, combined with the loan received under the CARES Act,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 846.07-854.57: The Q2 restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that we'll successfully navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 855.22-862.56: The capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.94-873.81: As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in August. However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 874.45-878.08: Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 878.66-887.19: However, given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends, we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 887.73-891.71: We expect 2020 year-to-date gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 891.77-900.08: Though as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid-30s as we sell through our excess inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 900.80-906.49: We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low 30 million dollars for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 907.57-911.63: No different than for many other companies, COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 911.83-917.76: However, with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs, and ensure adequate liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 917.92-923.08: I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 is a much stronger company than when we entered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.62-926.27: With that, we will now open up the call for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.59-938.22: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press start in the number one key on your touchtone telephone. Again, that is start in the number one key on your touchtone telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 938.72-945.37: Your first question comes from the line of Elliot Alper from DA Davidson. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 946.85-950.87: So thanks for the info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter, I guess. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.21-959.22: Could you talk about any trends, quarter to date specifically, and specifically geographic sales mix? Are you seeing any material changes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 960.00-963.40: With sales and geographies that have lost restrictions compared to those that have more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 965.19-973.07: Yeah, just a couple of notes. With the Apple launch happening a little bit later than we had experienced previously,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.73-981.96: There was maybe $5 million of sales that shifted from Q3 into Q4, which obviously benefit the sequential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 981.98-983.82: The sequential look at revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 984.68-991.77: Overall though, we're seeing really good sell-through of the phones. It seems to be doing very successful in market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.79-995.94: And obviously we're benefiting from that. So Q4 starting off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 995.96-997.22: Really, really well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.88-1004.36: In terms of geos, no material change in geo expansion. Chris mentioned geo mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.68-1013.33: Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks that we are definitely seeing some headwinds at least in terms of shutdowns in some of our international locations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1013.65-1020.08: However, the wireless dealers in those locations have been deemed as essential and so those have remained open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1020.50-1024.36: So it remains to be seen as to how that's going to impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1024.38-1029.37: Demand but I think overall we're definitely seeing some strong signs that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1029.39-1037.96: That we're kind of getting back to a more normal Q4 experience, though obviously COVID remains a bit of a cloud over everything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1040.38-1044.80: Okay, great. And then aside from the Apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1045.57-1052.23: Can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically and kind of any implications that may have on the December quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.53-1058.56: We are starting to see the Black Fridays more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1058.62-1063.00: Some retailers are taking strategy where they are spreading it out over a number of days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1063.02-1065.69: Over the month so that's something that's going to be different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1065.71-1073.99: I think we're still going to see a pretty strong online attachment from both Zag.com and obviously through Amazon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1074.65-1083.72: We are very optimistic about the early sell through on our screen protection cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.88-1089.41: And that's given that we still have a number of other devices to hit the market actually this week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1090.45-1094.59: Overall I think we have some good runway for the holidays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1102.72-1107.69: And once again, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your touchtone telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.07-1113.59: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Dane from Titan Capital Management. Your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.22-1120.92: I was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping costs that you are going. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1121.22-1126.13: In the third quarter just to give us some better idea how the housing system can do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1127.45-1133.23: Yeah, it was between two and three million dollars. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1133.69-1140.96: You know, we really, it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and, you know, sell through, picked up at the end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.48-1145.95: We did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some expedited air freight charges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1148.55-1155.16: For the fourth quarter. Are you expecting that to reoccur or is it heavy caught up and you feel like you're in a better place? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1157.06-1158.46: It's a great question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.08-1162.94: I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.58-1173.07: The one thing that's also kind of impacted us no different than every other company that's importing from overseas is just generally freight rates have increased kind of globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1173.37-1175.12: And so that's also impacted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1175.44-1182.58: I think there's probably going to be a little bit of that. As I mentioned, it's a bit of a balancing act. We definitely wanted to be careful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1182.70-1190.41: Given the pandemic and how much inventory we were planning, and fortunately or unfortunately, we've seen some upsides, which is great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.47-1200.12: But we've had to chase those. And so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit, which will impact some of our Q4 sales and then also obviously the spend on freight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.46-1208.99: Also wanted to ask if I could really quickly about the tariff situation. Now with the Biden presidency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1209.71-1212.49: You've been moving some production out of China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.43-1217.58: To change your view on moving production out of China? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1217.96-1220.00: How are you thinking about this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1223.08-1232.43: I think it doesn't change our strategy ultimately we were looking to diversify across our CM base and make sure that we're setting the company up for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1232.47-1234.29: Continued business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1234.39-1244.20: We are still following the strategy and we have had a very good quarter where we have now successfully piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1244.44-1247.21: So it gives us that ability to be able to shift our... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1247.23-1249.07: Our supply chain when needed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.65-1252.97: Obviously China is still a big part of our strategy but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1252.99-1259.86: What I like is we're not just looking at it from a tariff perspective now, we're really looking at it from a business continuity perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.81-1271.99: Thank you. Once again, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number 1 on your touchtone telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1283.14-1289.73: Gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Chris Inherent for any closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1290.83-1297.20: Thank you and thank everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report. We look forward to updating you again on Q4.
