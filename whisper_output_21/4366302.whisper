asr:0: OUTPUT 110.05-117.80: Thank you, Carla. First, I'd like to offer our best wishes to everyone as we approach five months since the start of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 119.28-129.05: We are encouraged by the positive signs of recovery in the healthcare space and grateful for those who've worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic, including our tenants and partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 130.29-134.49: They have demonstrated extraordinary resilience, well beyond what we anticipated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.18-140.16: We expect we will continue to contend with COVID-19 as it ebbs and flows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 141.34-145.85: What's encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 146.49-152.79: Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and many others are reporting positive results from fast-tracked clinical trials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 153.89-159.22: Many expect a successful vaccine in 2020 with widespread availability next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 160.62-168.83: Public health officials are also taking a much more targeted approach to addressing hotspots, which is allowing healthcare services to remain open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 170.93-176.68: Across the country, we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly, now approaching pre-COVID levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 177.62-180.28: They are experiencing heightened demand for delayed care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 180.66-188.49: Providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions, and they have gained valuable experience in treating their COVID patients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 189.41-194.55: As a result, we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bans on elected procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 196.26-201.90: Several publicly traded national healthcare companies, including HCA, Surgery Partners, and Tenet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 201.92-206.67: Have recently reported steady improvements in volumes throughout May, June, and July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 207.49-213.53: Likewise, we have seen tenant utilization in our buildings rebound to nearly 90% of pre-COVID levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 215.08-222.96: It does vary geographically somewhat from a low of 75% in Washington, D.C. To 100% here in Nashville. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 224.26-227.51: And at work order requests are now running at pre-COVID levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 228.37-230.35: And leasing momentum has also rebounded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 230.93-238.72: Tours with prospective tenants, which dip below 50% of typical volumes in April, are now running well above average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 240.46-244.94: Rent collection stands at 97% for the second quarter as well as July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 246.25-256.20: New deferral requests have fallen to nearly zero in the last 30 days. And over half of deferrals granted during the second quarter were repaid early, which is very encouraging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.42-262.24: Forgivable PPP loans kicked in as designed for payroll, rent, and utilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 263.18-271.75: The healthcare sector received more than 12% of all PPP loans, of which the biggest recipients were physician offices at more than $8.4 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 274.75-279.02: HR's operating results for the second quarter were steady despite the impact of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 279.84-285.15: Strong cash leasing spreads, high tenant retention, and stable contractual rent bumps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 285.85-290.29: Were positive signs of the resiliency of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 291.95-298.76: With tours being well off pace in April and May, occupancy could be marginally softer in the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 299.78-304.50: But with a sharp recovery in June and July, we expect occupancy to strengthen going into 21. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 305.77-313.07: As a result, same-store-on-Wye growth will likely be closer to 2% in 2020 and bounce back toward 3% next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 315.32-323.24: External growth is still on pace for a solid 2020. The pipeline is strong, even after we took extra time to underwrite the financial health of tenants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.34-331.57: We have increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be in line with our volume last year and well ahead of our historical average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 332.99-340.58: We have plenty of funding capacity from the Mercy Dispositions, Cash on Hand, Forward Equity, and full availability on our line of credit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 341.72-344.74: We are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 347.19-352.27: The pandemic has underscored the critical nature of health care services, even in uncertain times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 353.21-361.88: It has shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care, including high-acuity outpatient services, which drive the stability of our cash flows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 363.64-369.05: Despite the pandemic, we still expect to produce positive FFO per share growth in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 370.51-378.94: Rising secular demand, a strong balance sheet, and a robust pipeline position us well to grow safely in the years ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 380.54-385.71: Now I'll turn it over to Ms. Mancini for some additional commentary on healthcare trends. Bethany? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 387.61-395.26: Thank you. The healthcare sector continues to prove its resilience and significance to the US population and economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 395.88-405.17: After five months of experience with COVID-19, hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate PPE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 405.19-406.85: To serve COVID patients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 407.99-413.13: At the same time, providers are managing higher demand from the delay of scheduled care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 414.19-421.20: Second quarter employment growth numbers are showing COVID's unprecedented impact on jobs in April and May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 421.56-430.31: With promising signs of recovery in the healthcare sector from late May into June and continued positive momentum heading into the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.25-439.68: Notably, the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector, including physician offices, has doubled that of the broader economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 441.52-450.95: Healthcare providers are meeting pent-up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends returning to more normalized levels quickly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 452.19-460.58: HR's tenants on average are operating near full capacity and they are better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 461.16-463.22: Even in the event of a local surge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 464.40-468.35: Telemedicine served a critical role in April and May for many providers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.79-472.09: The easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 472.11-479.22: Help sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non-emergent care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 480.06-486.71: Since then, physician offices in most of our markets have returned to seeing a majority of patients in person. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 488.41-495.58: The Trump administration issued an executive order earlier this week to review and continue Medicare's coverage of telehealth services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 496.52-499.60: After which CMS proposed to permanently allow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 499.62-507.93: Medicare providers to use telehealth for evaluation and management services, along with visits for some mental health-related care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 509.09-513.33: Depending on reimbursement and technology and security requirements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.53-520.42: We foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 521.14-525.83: It could spur greater access of rural communities to urban care centers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 526.01-532.67: And support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high-acuity care from an aging population. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 534.05-540.02: CMS remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several Medicare cost-saving initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.70-548.39: These include hospital pricing transparency, site neutral payments for off-campus hospital-based outpatient care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 548.41-552.09: And the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 553.07-561.36: These initiatives incentivize care in lower cost settings, typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 562.52-572.41: As we approach the presidential election, we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus and COVID-19 relief for healthcare providers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.63-575.84: We believe the sector is positioned well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 576.10-578.50: Even absent additional legislation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 578.52-587.29: To continue to meet the demands of responding to COVID and deliver the underlying growth in healthcare services, our population will need in the quarters to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 588.43-598.32: The results of the election for both the presidency and Congress could impact the nation's mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of Medicare and Medicaid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 599.34-608.31: Regardless of election results, we expect the shift of healthcare delivery will continue toward lower cost outpatient settings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.51-613.89: Now I will turn it over to Rob Hull for an overview of investment activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 613.97-617.54: Rob? Thank you, Bethany. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.62-624.56: Healthcare realties investment activity during the quarter can be characterized as two distinct periods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 625.85-629.93: Defense at the outset, and back to offense by the end of the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 631.47-640.20: We started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell two single-tenant net lease properties to St. Louis-based Mercy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.22-642.58: For $244 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.60-645.04: Or $633 per square foot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.89-650.95: What's also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 650.97-659.50: Out of slower growing properties and smaller markets and into attractive growing MSAs with significant opportunities for future investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 661.76-671.63: Additionally, we took a deeper dive in due diligence for acquisitions, rather than terminating contracts and risk losing solid deals because of COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 673.53-679.82: For example, we doubled the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.96-685.19: We also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.45-692.65: And we analyze rent collection and deferral requests at buildings under contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 692.67-696.84: Compared it to our own portfolio and it's stacked up really well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 699.06-704.40: These critical steps allowed us to shift to offense as we approached the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 706.05-710.23: In July, we closed on four MOBs for $83 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 711.67-716.60: One property marks our first acquisition in the San Diego market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 717.26-722.06: A market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 724.10-732.49: Another in Los Angeles will benefit from the hospital's recent affiliation with AA-rated Cedars-Sinai Health System. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 732.51-738.22: Which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 740.00-743.92: The last two, located in Atlanta and Seattle,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 743.94-750.19: Represents additional investment in attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple properties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 752.75-759.98: All through the quarter, our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 760.96-763.78: Even as the volume of marketed transactions declined. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 766.01-773.23: We now have 10 buildings under six separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional $163 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 774.89-782.00: These targeted acquisitions are located in six markets where we already are invested. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 784.00-793.89: We expect to close these deals by year end and, along with properties closed in July, will fully reinvest the $244 million of Mercy proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 796.56-803.36: Our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and a growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.46-806.59: Up to $300 to $375 million for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.25-812.65: We expect our average cap rate to remain between 5 and 5.8%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 815.70-824.80: The outlook for acquisitions remains positive as healthcare providers continue to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 825.75-830.31: MOV rent rolls are holding up, allowing sellers to return to the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.85-841.88: Although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines, cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep for the stable cash flows from MOBs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 843.70-853.43: While several sizable portfolios are available, we haven't found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in one or two buildings at a time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 856.24-861.96: On the development front, we are making steady progress on a $30 million redevelopment project in Memphis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.40-871.29: During the course of the pandemic, several tenants expanded their space requirements, including the surgery center and a large orthopedic tenant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.53-876.52: As a result, the lease percentage has moved up to 94%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 878.08-885.93: During the first quarter of 2021, we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the building's anchor tenant to take occupancy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 888.15-892.97: The remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the second and third quarters of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 895.38-902.92: The pandemic has delayed some development discussions, but hospitals are not abandoning long-term expansion plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 904.20-910.75: For example, in July, a leading health system in Tacoma announced a $300 million investment in a new bed tower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 912.31-918.28: And next week, here in Nashville, St. Thomas will break ground on its $300 million expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 920.00-925.83: We are planning redevelopments at both of these campuses. And we expect to start these projects soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.25-932.57: I am pleased with our team's ability to build a solid investment pipeline during these times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 934.19-943.72: Their hard work will lead to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positions as well for creative growth in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 945.91-950.93: Now I will turn it over to Chris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 952.93-954.29: Thanks, Rob. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 955.62-963.96: Second quarter performance was strong as COVID-related revenue impacts were offset by operating expense controls and GNA reductions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 965.02-971.61: Normalized FFO per share of 42 cents was an increase of 5% over the same period a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.15-979.00: Before diving into the specific operating metrics for the quarter, I will touch on rent collection and deferrals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 980.56-984.54: We saw significant sequential improvements in May, June, and July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 985.35-992.39: This was the result of a swift rebound in patient volumes following the end of government-mandated shutdowns early in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.55-998.74: We collected over 99% of second quarter rent, including 2% of deferrals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1000.00-1003.00: These referrals are to be paid back in the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.42-1011.13: For July, deferrals were less than $100,000 of our over $40 million in monthly rent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1012.49-1020.16: In addition, over half of deferrals granted in the second quarter were repaid early, signaling how our tenants are getting back to business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.88-1026.57: Scheduled rent deferral payments for July are tracking well at 88%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1027.53-1034.11: While this is promising, it is early in the process, so we took a $730,000 bad debt reserve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1034.15-1038.20: Representing 25% of outstanding deferrals at quarter end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1039.28-1044.92: We will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1046.81-1048.53: Now shifting to operating performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.43-1057.86: Trailing 12-month same-store NOI grew 1.9%, which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter in three main ways. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1058.90-1063.92: First, there was an $800,000 sequential reduction in transient parking income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1065.27-1070.47: Parking volumes returned to approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of June. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1072.11-1078.96: Second, $673,000 of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same store portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.16-1089.17: And third, and most notable, was a benefit of $1 million from a reduction in net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.93-1096.90: The primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities, which each declined over a half a million dollars compared to the previous year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.42-1107.35: As utilization and foot traffic has rebounded in June and July, we expect operating expenses to return to more customary third quarter levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1107.37-1109.91: Including typical seasonal utilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1111.53-1118.14: But for these three impacts, trailing 12 months same store growth would have been approximately 20 basis points higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1120.10-1125.85: NOI growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multi-tenant leasing metrics this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1126.47-1130.83: Including retention of 84.6%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.85-1138.08: Average in-place contractual increases of 2.89% and cash leasing spreads of 4.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1139.82-1148.45: In the quarter, we had 179,000 square feet of new leases take occupancy, led by gains at several reposition and development properties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1149.75-1155.78: This level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately 100,000 square feet per quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1157.26-1167.21: Looking forward, given a slowdown in leasing tours early in the second quarter due to local restrictions, we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.21-1171.55: Our same-store guidance reflects the potential for this impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1172.77-1181.26: Moving into 2021, we expect leasing to increase as tours have already rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.36-1184.72: And demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.17-1196.22: Now shifting to liquidity and leverage. Our FAD dividend payout ratio was 84% for the quarter and 93% for the trailing 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.36-1200.90: We expect full year 2020 to be in the low 90s. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.52-1210.09: And net debt to EBITDA improved to 5.1 times, including the issuance of $33 million of equity through the ATM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1211.63-1221.36: In addition, we entered into forward equity contracts for an additional $74 million. These proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.52-1230.95: We don't expect to draw any of the forward equity proceeds until 21, given the substantial liquidity available to fund our growing investment pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1232.29-1240.94: Our liquidity includes $44 million of cash at quarter end and $244 million from the Mercy dispositions which closed last week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1242.60-1248.11: Our investment in the Mercy properties resulted in an unlevered IRR of 11.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.29-1257.44: While the reinvestment in multi-tenant MOBs and major MSAs will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1258.74-1264.76: For example, contractual escalators for the Mercy assets have been running 1.7%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.01-1271.41: Which is more than 100 basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1272.99-1278.56: The cap rate rotation upon reinvestment will result in a little more than three cents of annual dilution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1279.94-1286.97: The timing of the reinvestment through the third and fourth quarters will bring forward all of the three plus cents into 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.33-1297.42: However, even with this dilution and the COVID-19 impacts discussed earlier, we anticipate positive FFO per share growth in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.48-1303.70: And we are positioned well for continued FFO per share growth in 21 and beyond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.65-1309.05: Todd? Thank you, Chris. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1311.01-1316.48: Operator check, we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1317.46-1323.94: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your touchtone phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.28-1331.37: If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press stars and two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1331.73-1334.65: At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1340.44-1344.82: And our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1345.85-1353.21: Thank you. I appreciate the color on the acquisition pipeline. What's the typical hit rate on assets that are in negotiation? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1355.58-1362.18: I think if you look at the pipeline, $163 million that we're looking at right now, there's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1363.00-1370.79: They're within our range that we've given the 5 to 5a, probably down in the low to mid fives is where on average those are going to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.31-1375.96: I guess I'm more curious on the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1376.12-1381.34: Yeah, the 120 in negotiation. I mean, would you expect to close on 100% of those? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1381.40-1386.91: What's typically the fallout for that bucket of potential acquisitions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.39-1396.42: Yeah, I mean, I think if you think about the 120, we've said that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then moving into early next. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1396.74-1407.37: And I would say the cap rates in those buildings are in a similar range to what we have under contract and pipeline. And certainly, it's early, and we're in discussions with those sellers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1407.91-1417.52: There are some that sometimes may fall out or take longer to close on, but we have a good line of sight on those and are optimistic about the opportunities there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1418.94-1425.21: I would add to that, maybe Nick, it's a little hard to obviously give you a one percentage probability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.35-1429.57: But it's a range, but I think you know, it's not 50-50. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1429.69-1438.32: If that helps you. It's probably not 100%, as Rob just said, but maybe it's 70-80% at least. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1438.54-1442.48: And the nice thing is, I mean, those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.86-1448.61: There's clearly a lot of other things not in that number that are a little further out there, maybe not as highly probable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1448.69-1456.70: So, yeah, I think it's that number is a strong number just in general if you think about productivity going into 21. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1458.66-1461.46: Helpful. And then you mentioned the portfolios on the market today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.28-1471.29: What would make you more interested? Is it pricing? Is it something specific about the mix of assets within those that would get you more interested in executing on those? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.15-1483.08: Yeah, I'd say that rather than pricing, just the markets and the systems that they're associated with, the strength of those markets, the opportunities for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1484.22-1486.01: Is really a key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.09-1487.09: Peace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.13-1496.82: That we look at, and I would also say that the on-adjacent makeup versus the off-makeup, typically what you see is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1496.84-1504.20: There's a number of properties, a few properties in there that you really like, but then there's other properties in there that you really don't like. And I think that's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1504.22-1507.37: Worse, these portfolios that are out there, they kind of fall into now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1508.85-1518.18: And Nick, I think as we've looked at portfolios over the years, we also recognize you can't always find the perfect portfolio by definition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.26-1520.22: And so it really comes down to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1520.28-1524.62: Is there a high enough proportion of what Rob described as attractive assets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1524.64-1532.67: That would be worth taking on a few of those things that we don't like as much. And so we've always struggled with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1532.73-1538.46: We obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we're looking for and we want to improve the average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1538.48-1544.40: But if 70-80% of the assets really fit, then I think it makes some sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1544.92-1550.77: You know, the Meta's an only transaction, the Atlanta transaction three years ago, you know, is a great example of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1551.95-1560.64: We certainly looked at the Duke transaction hard and competed for that. So I'd throw that in there, but some others like CNL and others, we couldn't get there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.09-1571.95: Our next question will come from Sarah Tan with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1574.73-1582.38: I'm on from Mike Muller, good morning. Just one question. Could you talk about the acquisition that I'm seeing and what Cameron is looking like? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1584.82-1588.23: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the end of your question. Can you repeat that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.23-1595.06: I just wanted to ask, could you discuss the acquisition landscape and what cat reach looks like? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1595.58-1599.86: Sure. I would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.10-1610.45: The cash flows and MOBs has held up remarkably well during this period, and I think that's a testament to the security and reliability of the asset class. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.25-1615.12: And so you're seeing continued demand for the product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1615.64-1619.70: There has been a few buyers that are temporarily on the sidelines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.12-1629.45: But we see plenty of capital continuing to participate in the space. And so because of that, we just haven't seen any meaningful movement in cap rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.71-1639.80: The other thing, Rob, I might add to that would be you've even seen, really since COVID, a couple of transactions by Welltower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1639.82-1648.23: Are very supportive of that. You've seen cap rates right in the mid-fives for those portfolios. I think that underscores that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.25-1651.83: You know, that five and a half range for typical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1651.91-1658.64: MOBs and portfolios is very consistent over the last couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1658.74-1660.46: And then occasionally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1660.48-1668.89: You see deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may drive it towards five or less or the other way for lower quality assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.44-1683.70: Will come from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1684.94-1686.09: Thanks for taking the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.89-1691.61: Here's the first one. You had a nice improvement on the fat payout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1691.83-1695.42: And you highlighted where you think this could end up towards your end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.44-1703.50: And I'm just wondering how sustainable that level is. Is there any gap X kind of bump we should expect next year or do you think this level is sort of sustainable going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.79-1709.81: I'll touch on it and maybe you jump in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.91-1716.24: Remember, we're all social distancing, so we aren't as easily able to... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.14-1719.20: Not talk over each other, which I apologize, Chris. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.20-1726.13: I would say on the dividend, you're exactly right, Vikram. Chris mentioned low 90s for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1726.53-1734.17: And certainly we're trying to steadily improve that. So we do hope to maintain that level, if not improve it, each year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1735.36-1743.32: But, as Chris also talked about, we've got a lot of leasing strengthening as we go into the later part of this year and into next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1743.34-1747.95: We do expect that what probably benefited us, frankly, in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1748.07-1751.81: And maybe even in the third would be a little less spending on TI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1752.59-1754.09: Because of the slowdown in leasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1754.49-1760.90: We see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year. So, you know, it's a little early to tell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.04-1765.93: Exactly where we'll be for 21, but we like the direction generally where we're headed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.23-1771.95: And we'll certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans together for 21 later this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1774.71-1780.00: I think Todd's right. The only thing I would add to that is just the idea that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.12-1786.73: Where we are in terms of our capital other than TI, I don't see any major shifts there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.99-1791.57: But if we don't see the continued improvement that we have been seeing the last several years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.59-1809.07: It would be tied to that, be tied to absorption and new leasing, which is great for long term in terms of earnings and such, but could slow the momentum temporarily in terms of continued driving that payout ratio lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.29-1812.83: But long term, we're certainly moving in the right direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1814.91-1823.14: And then just a little bit more color on the pipeline, I know in the past we've alluded to potentially looking a bit more at off-campus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1824.18-1826.49: I'm just wondering through COVID are there, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1826.53-1837.34: How has that thought process changed? Maybe give us a sense of the pipeline mix between on and off. And also just through COVID, are there any other markets you're thinking about in terms of new investments or development? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1839.04-1845.69: Rob, do you want to touch on maybe the current pipeline and what that might look like on versus off, and then I can add to it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.97-1849.53: Yeah, I think that when you look at the current pipeline,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.83-1851.11: The majority of it is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1851.13-1859.96: Is on an adjacent, but there are a few assets in there that kind of fall into the on-campus category by our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.02-1861.72: Definition and I think those are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1861.82-1870.15: Kind of similar what you've heard us say in the past, Vikram, about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.83-1875.50: And I think that's where, if we are gonna go off campus, that's where you think we will do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1875.86-1885.13: That kind of investing markets that we know are familiar with and investing in off-campus assets that are sort of part of the provider network and lend itself to that relationship. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1887.37-1895.78: I would add, Rob, that in terms of just thinking differently, you know, post COVID or now we're still in COVID, but as we look ahead,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.84-1902.38: I don't see that we would make a tremendous change in the markets that we're going after. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1902.40-1907.47: Building our presence and still look very attractive to us, you know, even with what's going on now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1908.25-1910.83: Obviously, like everyone, we're going to be watching all the trends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1911.21-1915.94: We're not heavily exposed to certain markets in the Northeast, New York, Boston. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1916.48-1924.82: Great cities, obviously, but there are some bigger challenges that may come over time with office demand and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.77-1935.18: Less about healthcare there, but I would say we really like some of the tech job concentration that we see in a lot of the markets we've been focused on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1935.78-1938.88: Two of the markets that we've added, you kind of asked that question about adding markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.16-1941.82: We just added San Diego, as Rob pointed out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1941.88-1946.59: In the last year, we've been adding a bit in the Raleigh-Durham area, which we like as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1947.27-1956.28: But nearly 90% of what we've been doing, 80, 90% of the activity in the last few years has been very focused on our top 15 markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1956.60-1964.28: So it's a lot of activity in the same markets we've been building scale in. And then occasionally reaching out, like I mentioned, to San Diego, Raleigh, some others like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.50-1970.33: There's probably four or five other markets we'd certainly look at and see some depth in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1970.35-1974.51: We're definitely leaning towards the markets we're currently invested in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1978.12-1986.37: Thank you, Victor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1990.05-1997.80: Thank you. First, I just want to follow up on the pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.88-2005.47: I'm not sure if I'm overly reading into your commentary, but it sounded like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2005.97-2012.83: Is there potentially more behind this or are there a handful of larger deals that you're looking at? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2013.31-2014.79: I'm noticing... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2014.81-2020.62: You're taking the leverage on a pro forma basis quite low and I know it's a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.64-2030.89: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.05-2033.83: Kind of curious what your T-depth for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2035.36-2043.98: Yeah, I would say on the pipeline, Jordan, our team is always building and adding to our pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2044.20-2046.61: We take the approach of, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.45-2057.60: I think if you look at what we've closed on this year, about 80% of that is what we would consider all for lightly marketed deals. So our team is out there constantly developing those relationships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2058.10-2060.22: We've identified buildings that we want to own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.68-2068.65: And, you know, we have dialogue with the sellers or brokers in those markets that we trust. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2068.67-2072.15: You know are constantly trying to get those sellers to the table so we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2072.17-2084.24: We think that behind what we've laid out here, certainly there's more opportunity that we're working on, and I think that's where we see the growth in the pipeline coming and setting us up well for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.25-2094.87: I think that's why we have the confidence that we do, because we see the dialogue that our team is having with these sellers that are sort of behind what we've laid out here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.82-2104.08: Jordan, I would add to that. I think maybe what's in your question too is sort of, are we preparing for something bigger? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.38-2105.69: I think it's more about... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2106.37-2110.09: In some ways, yes, but it's not a complete change of stripes for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2110.11-2117.84: I think it's very much sticking to what Rob just described, really going after and targeting what we want rather than waiting on the market to deal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2118.16-2122.52: That said, of course, we look at the market of deals and if they measure up, we certainly go after them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2123.06-2126.05: We certainly are encouraged that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2126.07-2135.18: We would like to go after some deals if we can in this situation where we seem to be able to, as you said, have the capital and the resources. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2135.20-2139.66: Again, we're going to probably stick to, as you would know us to do, stick to the quality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2139.88-2140.88: Side of things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.20-2148.95: But we're encouraged by the productivity and the effectiveness that Rob described of sustaining a higher level of acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2149.15-2150.27: I think that's the key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2150.29-2159.88: And really recognizing the importance of prudent growth or external growth in addition to our internal growth to kind of work that algorithm of FFO growth per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2162.38-2168.25: Is the mix going to skew? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2168.27-2172.73: Continue to skew toward the adjacent type assets, you think? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2174.85-2184.26: I certainly think we will skew towards on and adjacent versus off, but again, we're okay with off. I think Rob touched on that. We are okay with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2184.80-2190.13: I would say today we sit closer to almost 90% on an adjacent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2190.99-2194.71: We have done a fair bit of adjacent, as you kind of point out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2195.12-2197.96: And sometimes what you find is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2197.98-2207.31: Those are the ones that you can go in and target and really get those assets more regularly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2207.35-2210.85: It's tough because you're waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2210.87-2214.39: We really like the dynamic though on an adjacent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.73-2224.52: And I could see the off fluctuating. I think we maybe last year hit around 25% off. So we're OK with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2224.70-2227.37: It's still going to skew that way towards on an adjacent step. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.75-2240.52: And then lastly, maybe for Chris on the cap rates, I've got the cash cap rates here. I'm kind of curious, you mentioned the escalators on Mercy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.62-2250.47: Can you give me the gap cap rate on that disposition? And then I'm just curious what the escalators and gap cap rates look on the acquisitions as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2251.87-2259.94: Yeah, on Mercy, the gap in cash were pretty close to the same because we were about the midpoint of the lease term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.80-2263.88: So they're kind of right on top of each other. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2265.07-2271.69: In terms of the new acquisitions that we're looking at, the escalators, as I mentioned,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2271.71-2279.20: Pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is, that 2.8 to 2.9 range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2279.22-2281.62: In terms of escalators and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.70-2290.15: It varies on the impact of the gap based off of the term that is inside of our acquisitions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2290.17-2300.68: But in general, we typically say the gap adds about 25 to 50 basis points to the cap rate on a gap basis in our acquisitions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.23-2317.46: Our next question will come from Lucas Hartrich with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2319.08-2324.20: I thank everyone for your time this morning. This is John on for Lucas. Just a quick one from me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2324.92-2330.43: Just looking at the improvements in your expectations for the cash releasing spreads on the multi-tenant side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.31-2336.98: What's behind that optimism? The year-to-date trends are pretty favorable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2337.46-2342.66: And just wondering if there's actually some opportunity for some outside there as well. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2345.03-2350.57: Yeah, if you really look at the change in our guidance on the cash leasing spreads,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2350.65-2357.36: We did change it this quarter compared to last, but that really was just kind of bringing it back more in line with what we had seen pre-COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2358.42-2361.76: Last quarter we were taking, we didn't want to be overly aggressive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.82-2365.71: Having a lot of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.73-2373.75: Leasing data in the midst of what was going on and so we had taken down our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2374.05-2379.92: But as we worked through leases during the quarter and continued our discussions,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2380.84-2384.70: Things have really shown great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2384.72-2394.19: You know, resilience. And so our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads will be able to kind of maintain what we had been seeing previously. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.06-2397.50: Which long term we say we expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2397.52-2405.13: Three to four. And so we're so far we're seeing that those types of metrics are holding up well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2418.28-2425.17: And our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Thanks, everybody. Good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2426.75-2431.61: So one thing we are not talking about is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2431.63-2439.86: The risk going forward of reinfection and certainly in many of the states that you traffic in, we've seen some uptick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.40-2448.01: But no talk of a reversal of elective surgery shutdowns and whatnot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2449.53-2458.30: Can you discuss that a little bit about how you're seeing that play out? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.32-2469.93: For elective surgeries? Are people really jumping in and doing it? And is there a risk that a month or so from now we could be having another conversation about shutting it down? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2472.13-2479.38: Rich, it's a very good question and I think we all sort of have that unease going into the fall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2479.58-2480.76: I think collectively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2480.82-2482.66: That things can change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2482.70-2491.19: And we have the flu season coming and things get worse typically in the winter. So it's a very good question. I do think we don't want to be glib about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2491.43-2494.57: The optimism because you know it's a long road here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2494.59-2500.56: And maybe the toughest time ahead of us. The good news is, I think, as I think Bethany pointed out and I pointed out,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2501.08-2506.51: And we've all seen there's just been a lot of improvement on treatments and how to deal with this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.59-2512.39: And so I think we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2512.63-2515.10: And obviously that was tested in a couple of places. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2515.70-2521.40: New York and and I think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we all feared and so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.42-2526.29: You're seeing it as you said in hot spots, Houston went through it and you're seeing different places. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.87-2529.63: And the good news is they seem to be handling it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2529.71-2532.79: And it's not creating these long, lengthy shutdowns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2532.93-2541.86: You did see in Texas the governor trying to push some again policies there, but it really actually was a bit of a carve out for ASCs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2541.98-2546.37: Know, in some of the outpatient surgeries, it was more about protecting that inpatient capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.61-2548.23: I do think you're going to see a little bit of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.31-2557.44: We do have to brace for that in terms of hotspots. I don't think it's nationwide shut it all down the way it was early on. It's going to be much more targeted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2558.40-2567.01: I'm no expert anymore than anybody on the phone, but as we watch this move around the country, it's the hot spot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.09-2575.08: These fires that come up and then burn out. I hope that continues to be quelled and contained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2575.38-2580.66: I think it's very encouraging what we're seeing, even though we might experience some issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2581.14-2585.73: I think we're encouraged, I mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.53-2589.25: So I don't think there's a big hesitation to come back and do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2589.57-2597.90: It'll just be a matter of, you know, do public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a targeted way rather than a blanket way? And we think that will be the case. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2600.44-2609.75: My second question and last question is what is your perspective of how the hospital industry looks like? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2609.77-2611.47: After this is all done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2611.55-2614.51: I mean, would you say the hospital in business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2615.10-2619.62: Not the medical office business per se but the hospital business is weakened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2619.88-2625.73: By all this in the sense that we kind of went in over-hospitaled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2625.77-2637.58: To begin with, and maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would have happened eventually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.14-2641.42: I'm just wondering if you think... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2641.64-2643.98: Sort of picking your. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2644.00-2656.34: Your relationships become even more important in the aftermath because the hospital industry overall is probably a notch weaker because of everything that happened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.40-2662.26: I think it's a fair assessment and good commentary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2662.32-2669.63: We were having a discussion with our board earlier this week about that with several health system leaders there on our board and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2670.09-2677.30: And I think it's what you said, it's the classic problem that these crises, just like the financial crisis caused. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2677.88-2684.26: The strong are going to get stronger the weaker going to get weaker and there's different dynamics to that but in the hospital world It's very true. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2684.76-2688.35: And you're seeing NHCA do extremely well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2688.75-2695.94: Coming through this and I think they do a good job of figuring it out and there's a lot of not-for-profit systems that are leaders in their markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2696.24-2699.52: I do think the strength and scale matters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2700.00-2709.47: Larger systems versus small independent system. Obviously, more urban versus suburban versus rural is going to be a huge trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2709.51-2713.19: I know the trend of moving into the cities, everybody's questioning a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2713.29-2719.70: But I still think those strong population growth centers are going to be where you're going to see the success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2719.76-2724.08: And so I do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2724.48-2730.31: Being a sharpshooter will continue to be critical for success and I think that's something we've been honing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2730.71-2734.75: Ever since we sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis even before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2735.20-2744.32: So it's true, I do think you're right, hospitals probably taken, you know, certainly they've clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the CARES Act and CMS in general. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2744.38-2747.21: But I do think we are encouraged that the strong ones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.13-2755.24: This is a demand, need-based business. This isn't just selling luxury items. It's very much need-based. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2755.36-2762.04: And so there's a huge need for it. As I made my comments, a remark that, I mean, hospitals are proving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2762.06-2766.61: They're so critical and I think the acuity level of hospitals is only going to continue to climb. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2767.03-2772.11: And you're gonna see acuity level at outpatient climb, both on and off campus, it's a continuum. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2772.55-2775.44: And I think all those innovations will continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2775.48-2783.88: And it will be a little bit more of a winner versus loser at game. And I think we're pretty well positioned to follow that trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2784.60-2787.63: And as related to that response, thanks, Todd. That was great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2788.63-2793.63: Do you think the long-awaited monetization of hospital and medical office will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2793.65-2800.08: Will be more of a realistic outcome of this even for stronger hospitals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2800.10-2809.61: Maybe you're now taking on more market share, need more technological advances and so on. Is that something that we can finally say? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2811.67-2817.06: Well, not to get religious, but it's like testing our faith, right, in this theory? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2818.38-2824.06: And it's just, we've got to keep the hope alive, right? We just haven't seen it, is the real answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2824.92-2828.17: It has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2829.47-2834.13: We have a very contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we just did. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2834.73-2841.16: Little bit of a specific situation where they had a propensity to want to own their assets. So a little different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.42-2847.17: But we've heard of a few other anecdotes just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2847.19-2853.87: You know, hospital systems think strategically very differently. They don't focus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2853.93-2861.10: As they should, they focus on providing care and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2861.18-2869.25: They're not sitting around thinking about cap rates for MOBs, but I think there are going to be some more of those. It may be a little bit more from your stressed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2869.97-2877.18: Systems. Weeding through that back to your earlier question, figuring out is it worth it, is it the right systems to be with, is the question for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2879.40-2881.60: Thanks very much. Thanks Rich. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2884.72-2889.55: The next question will come from John Chen with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2891.35-2895.72: Good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2895.74-2904.46: You mentioned St. John, Hawaii, trending back to 3%, which is certainly against recent trends of not only HR, but other MLB leads. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2905.67-2914.43: I'm just wondering if you could just discuss your confidence levels in that statement and if that's being driven by occupancy picking up or... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2914.45-2917.78: Leasing spreads on leases that you're negotiating now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2920.06-2923.66: I think the simple answer is, and Chris always hits this,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2923.88-2930.91: It's that our average contractual rent bump across, you know, multi-tenant and single tenant is 2.83%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2931.77-2933.95: It's 2.89 for the multi-tenant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2934.05-2938.06: So that's the driver of our same store growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2938.12-2947.25: And what Chris always walks through is, okay, we grew the revenue at that level, and then you're right, you advance that ball a little bit with cash leasing spreads. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2947.27-2951.17: But that's a pretty small piece of the pie each quarter or year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2952.11-2956.68: So you do help that. You do have a little bit of turnover as well that kind of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2956.70-2964.90: It hurts that, but the revenue model is more of a high-twos kind of number, and then really it becomes, what are your expenses doing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2965.29-2967.59: And how much operating leverage do you have in your margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2968.01-2972.25: That's the algorithm we see that gets us there pretty conservatively with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2972.53-2978.66: But it's really the big driver is our revenue model of our escalators and we continue to feel good about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2979.10-2981.26: The cash leasing spreads help at the margin, absolutely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2982.16-2983.30: And as Chris talked... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2983.36-2987.71: We're looking to try to drive absorption as we go into 21, and that will help also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2987.73-2995.78: But even without a lot of increased absorption, you can see same-store inoigros running around three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2998.22-3007.29: And how does free rent impact this number? Because I imagine you're offering more free rent or you have been more recently. Chris, do you want to touch on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3008.11-3010.35: Yeah, I mean, obviously, free rent will go into it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3010.37-3018.24: If you have a larger percentage of it versus what you had before. But I'll say generally, no, we're not adding a lot of free rent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3019.24-3027.37: We really don't have much of any inside of our renewals. If we're doing it at all, it typically is inside of new leasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3028.11-3036.24: And so when you have that with the new leasing, it just kind of creates a little bit of a delay before you see the revenue impact from that absorption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3037.58-3044.62: But overall, no, we've not seen a marked expansion of free rent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3047.87-3051.63: And then maybe I'll ask Nick Joseph's question a little bit differently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.81-3059.36: I think at GNA you mentioned $150 million of acquisitions you had under contract and now you've closed $82 million post-quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3060.36-3065.23: Are you still on track to close that remaining $70 million or so, or have any of those deals fallen apart? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3067.27-3071.25: Yes, we're still on track to close those. I think we've got. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3071.39-3073.37: I think I mentioned we have $163 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3074.31-3081.70: That's either under contract or LOI. So we've actually increased that under contract amount since the last time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3083.38-3097.34: And I think, Rob, too, you said, and we expect that we will close those two categories under contract in LI by year end, which is what will help us get those MERCI proceeds reinvested by year end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3099.64-3103.76: And, the four adjacent acquisitions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3104.46-3109.85: You mentioned there are J- to A-rated health systems. Are those health systems at all tenants in the buildings required? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3113.09-3121.88: They have, I would say that they certainly have physicians that are utilizing the hospital next door. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3122.62-3129.25: I think there's one where the hospital is not a tenant, but all the others are tenants by the hospital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3137.96-3142.74: Our next question will come from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3143.68-3150.29: Thanks. Probably in order just to stick with that last theme about the assets under contract, and maybe this is for Rob. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3151.31-3153.49: Can you speak to the condition of those buildings? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3153.77-3158.44: I know historically you guys are prepared to put some redevelopment dollars into them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3159.10-3168.11: But in the context of maybe Todd what you were speaking to maybe TI's come down. Maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3169.67-3175.58: Yeah, I would say that the assets that were in the contract to purchase are all... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3175.60-3182.00: In good condition. I mean, we're not planning to invest a significant amount of capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3182.02-3185.63: Into any of them as a redevelopment play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.79-3187.99: If that's answering your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3189.85-3197.54: It is, thank you. And then maybe for Todd, did I hear that right? Maybe expectations of lower TIs coming down the road? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3199.34-3208.13: I think that's a 2020 phenomenon. We're not necessarily suggesting that looking into 2021. We actually think it should rebound to sort of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3208.15-3210.39: Historical levels and relationships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3211.07-3214.57: And all that is, is what we've heard some others say too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3214.99-3220.82: We had slower tours and new leasing activity with new prospective net new tenants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3220.84-3227.99: That create absorption, which is where you have higher TI spend in the second quarter, especially April and even a little in May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3228.33-3235.58: And therefore you get this lag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy and that's probably a third and fourth quarter phenomenon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3235.88-3244.22: It's really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw in the second quarter. That's all we're saying and then back to sort of normalized levels in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3245.55-3251.43: I would clarify that too. That's a little bit on the perspective leasing front, what Ty's talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3251.81-3261.76: And we don't know for sure, we're kind of running different scenarios. And so we're looking at one scenario that yes, we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3262.04-3268.15: Which could have an impact. But then also, if you look at it in terms of total spend and you start looking at FAD right now,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3268.45-3277.78: We are running at the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range as it relates to second gen TI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3278.64-3281.80: And so there's just timing that is always related to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3282.56-3288.65: So that may pick up, certainly we think will be in the range back to potentially near the midpoint of the range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3289.49-3292.85: So that's part of what is playing into the guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3292.87-3294.13: As it relates to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3294.15-3303.40: I talked about right now we are running significantly below where we are on a trailing 12-month basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3303.70-3311.73: We do think that that can pick up in the later half of the year and what drives our view that our FAB payout ratio will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3311.75-3313.85: We'll probably end up the year down in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3313.87-3318.38: In the low 90s, not in the low 80s that you saw this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3318.42-3320.46: So I just wanted to clarify that point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3321.02-3332.05: That's helpful, because that's where I was going ultimately with this, is seeing that FAD payout ratio decline, and in the spirit of seeing maybe some dividend growth at some point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3332.49-3335.52: But maybe it doesn't shake out that low. Okay, that's helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3336.94-3339.72: All right, that's it for me. Thank you. Thanks, Don. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3342.40-3347.81: The next question will come from Teo Okuseya with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3348.95-3353.69: Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the transaction. That makes perfect sense to me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3354.91-3363.14: My focus is on the outlook for the MOBs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3363.22-3371.57: Hospitals in general and the system will seem to be doing well when we think about HCA results and some of the other hospital operators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3372.11-3378.54: But a lot of that is also kind of due to the massive amount of grants they've kind of received over this period as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3379.72-3387.27: Can you just kind of talk about how you're thinking about kind of in a world where there are no grants or in a world where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3387.29-3396.64: Where that source of government funding is decreased maybe in the next act that Congress enacts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3397.54-3407.21: What do you see happening in that world? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3409.65-3414.83: Well, it's all speculation, obviously, Taya, but it's interesting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3415.70-3422.66: I think we saw the most extreme thing, hopefully, that we'll ever see in our lifetimes, right? But maybe not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3423.54-3430.69: Amen to that. Right, right. So, you know, April was just absolutely extreme and clearly the government steps in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3430.81-3438.44: And we just hope we don't see that again. But I think, as I mentioned, we've learned a lot. And I think we learned that hospitals, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3439.20-3448.57: Good or bad, you know, hospitals and physicians, they really make a lot of money on the elective procedure side and surgeries. And when that was shut down,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3448.63-3451.99: I mean, you're cutting off the most profitable segment of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3452.41-3458.18: And healthcare, it's a little cold to say that because obviously they're only doing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3458.36-3462.58: They're only supposed to be doing what's necessary, but it is necessary. There's a ton of that need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3463.10-3476.54: And so when you cut off that lifeblood, if you will, it really hurts the system. So I think now, if you go back to the discussions earlier, where it's more of a targeted approach, and maybe, you know, for a short period in Houston, they. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3476.56-3479.48: They asked for some elective procedures to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3479.50-3487.13: To be reduced, and not even in all ASCs but in hospitals. So I think you're going to see a more targeted approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3487.19-3491.05: Rather than the sort of absolute month long or more shutdown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3491.09-3495.96: So therefore, it shouldn't be quite as financially difficult. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3496.36-3501.28: Is it going to be tough? Yes, just like schools. Schools for a lot of us, kids and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3501.68-3507.45: It's going to be tough as soon as they shut down the school for a week or two or something, or even if you're lucky if they're open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3507.97-3515.88: There's going to be ebbs and flows, as I mentioned in my remarks, but I think we're much better shaped today than we were when we knew very little in March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3515.94-3525.85: I don't think it's as dire as we could all fear, but it's never, David Emory used to always say, it's never as good or as bad as it may seem, and that's probably very appropriate here.
