As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to host Drew McIntosh, investor relation for the New Home Company. Thank you, you may begin. 
Good morning, welcome to the New Home Company earning conference call. Earlier today the company released its financial results for the third quarter of 2020. 
Documents detailing these results are available on the investor relations section of the company's website at nwhm.com. 
Before the call begins I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made in the course of this call which are not historical facts or forward looking states that involve risk and uncertainty. 
A discussion of such risk and uncertainty is another important factor that could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. 
A date detailed in the company's filings made with the SCC, including and its most recent annual forward on form 10-K, and its quarterly reports on form 10-Q. 
The company undertakes no duty to update these forward looking statements that are made during this course, course of this call. 
Traditionally, non- GAAP financial measures may be discussed on this conference call. 
Reconciliations of these non- GAAP financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP can be assessed through the New Home Company's website 
and in its filings with the SCC. 
Also, on the call today is Larry Webb, executive chairman, Leonard Miller, president and chief executive officer and John Stevens, chief financial officer. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry. 
Thanks Drew, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today as we go over our results for the third quarter of 2020, 
providing update of our strategic outlook and give some additional caller on our operations. 
The New Home Company made significant progress and a series of strategic initiatives and generated a profit in the third quarter of 2020. 
We experienced healthy expansion to our home building gross margin, while continuing to emphasize overhead cost containment, 
thanks to several operational improvements and a very strong housing rebound. 
We generated 251 net new orders in the quarter. We are presenting a 102% increase as compared to last year. 
Namely as a result over 75% improvement in our sales pace, which came in at 3.5 homes per community per month. 
Order activity improved as the quarter progressed and we have seen demand trends stay above normal seasonal level since the quarter ended. 
The New Home market is benefiting from several positive factors, including record low interest rates, the scarcity of existing homes inventory 
and a noticeable shift in attitudes towards home ownership. 
Some of the shift can be attributed to the ongoing pandemic, 
which has made many Americans rethink how and where they live, given all the ways the virus is impacting our lives. 
But an equally important factor driving the move to home ownership, has been the emergence of the millennial age cohort as a buyer demographic. 
This sizeable age group was slow to enter the housing market relative to earlier generations, due to a number of factors. 
But we are now seeing millennials make up an increasingly large share of the buyer population. 
This demographic shift was occurring well before the pandemic started 
and we believe it will be a driving force for our industry well after the pandemic ends. 
While the positive fundamental backdrop for our industry has been a nice tailwind for our business, 
we believe our strong order activity this quarter was also the result of our expansion to more affordable price points. 
Over the last few years, we have been transitioning much of our portfolio 
away from high ASP communities and into the more affordable segments to the market. 
The goal is to take our premium brand experience, that is centered around industry leading customer service, 
best class quality, and innovative design 
and make it more accessible, through efficient, floor plans and higher density projects. 
This focus has served us well in the recent quarters and dovetails nicely with millennial demographic trends I just mentioned. 
Order activity at our newly opened affordable communities, has outpaced our legacy higher price communities by a wide margin. 
And we are seeing better prices and margin trends at these lower priced communities as well. 
This pricing power has been a key ingredient in making headway with one of our main initiatives for the year, gross margin expansion. 
Over the past several quarters our margins have been depressed due to our focus on generating cash, curing up the balance sheet 
and turning through higher price legacy communities. 
Now that we are in a much better position from both the financial and products standpoint, we have an opportunity to show real improvement on the gross margin front. 
We posted a 320 basis point year over year increase to our home building gross margin in the third quarter excluding impairments in the prior year 
and we feel we can push margins higher over time through steady price increases, better product mix and cost containment. 
While this margin projection will fluctuate depending on the mix of posts, we believe the long term trajectory is headed in the right direction. 
With a healthy demand outlook, a great product profile, rising margins and a much improved balance sheet, 
the New Home Company, is in a great position to end the year on a strong note and carry that momentum into the new year. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Leonard, who will provide more detail on our operations. 
Thanks Larry, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today. 
We experienced the wide spread acceleration demand in the third quarter, 
driven by low mortgage rates, limited existing home supply, 
a desire from buyers to move to less densely populated areas and the surge in millennial buyers that Larry mentioned. 
The demand was broad based, both from a price point and geographic standpoint, 
which allowed us to push pricing at nearly all of our communities during the quarter. 
Traffic conversion rates are at all time highs as buyers feel a sense of urgency to move forward with a purchase decision given the lack of available supply and low interest rates. 
As a result, our homes in backlogging increased at 329, which represented a 59% year over year improvement to end the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we expect order activity to remain above normal seasonal trends in the near term, 
but our focus is shifted, slightly, given the size of our backlog and our desire to increase margins. 
We wanna make sure our sales don't get too far out in front of our stocks, while also maximizing the profits from each new home sale. 
To that end, we have delayed some sales releases in an effort to align our sales with construction starts and implement additional price increases. 
While this may moderate our sales pace from the levels we have experienced recently, we believe this is a prudent way to manage our backlog and improve our margins. 
In terms of cost, lumbers recently hit am all time 
high, driven by diminished capacities, terrorists, uncertainty of COVID on workers in the mills and a rapid increase in sales in starts. 
Fortunately, we have started to see lumber pricing come down from its highs and hope this trend continues. 
Outside of lumber our material costs have remained relatively flat. 
With respect to our markets, Arizona continues to be the standout performer for us, averaging 4.1 sales per community per month. 
This strong absorption was driven by seven new communities we've recently opened over the past five months, 
which have also generated gross margins meaningfully higher than the company average. 
Our mirror posed a mini master plan consisting of three product segments opened the last week of September and sold 18 homes during the quarter, 
while the mosaic master plan continues to experience solid sales as well. 
We will deliver our first homes from our affordably priced communities in Arizona in the fourth quarter 
and we expect these communities to contribute significantly to the company's profit in 2021. 
Arizona still remains our most challenged market when it comes to labor and sub trade availability. 
And we have seen that lengthening of our cycle times by a few weeks as a result. 
We are working hard to overcome these issues and believe Arizona will be a key contributor to our company's success moving forward. 
The market dynamics in California as a whole, feel the best that they've been during the current housing cycle. 
Order paces continue to run at high levels and we are seeing cycle times stay relatively consistent. 
In Southern California, our communities averaged a sales pace of 3.1 per month during the quarter. 
Demand was particularly strong in the core areas of the Inland Empire where we can offer our premium brand experience at lower price points. 
We've targeted this region as a key component of our expansion to do more affordable products 
and we anticipate opening five affordably priced communities within the Inland Empire over the next 18 months. 
In Northern California, our communities average 3.6 sales per month for the quarter with strength across the board. 
Affordability remains an issue for most buyers in the Court Bay area and we've limited our exposure to this market as we have nearly closed out 
our remaining community in Milpitas. 
We continue to see a migration from the Bay area into the more affordable areas in and around Sacramento. 
Our four communities in Vacaville California have benefited significantly from this migration 
as our monthly sales absorption pace was 4.4 homes per community during this 2020 third quarter. 
As we continue to make changes to improve our profitability, 
we believe there is potential in our fee building business and are currently sourcing new opportunities. 
During the third quarter, we started construction on a model complex at Atlas. Our fee building community for five point at the great park in Irvine 
and expect to open for sales in early 2021. 
This arrangement is different than most of the traditional fee building arrangements we've had in the past 
as the New Home Company will also brand, market and sell these homes. 
We are currently in discussions with other land owners to build four cell housing and single family rental housing on a fee bases. 
These future opportunities will help partially offset a near term reduction in fee building 
revenues resulting from Irvine Pacific's decision to manage the construction of their home building operations 
on their own and face out our fee building arrangement with them. 
As a result, we expect our fee building revenues to decline over the next year and then increase in 2022 
as newer opportunities start generating fee revenue and profits. 
We are excited for these new opportunities and believe they can generate meaningful income in the future, using nominal capital. 
In summary, we continue to benefit from extremely strong housing fundamentals in all of our markets and our recently opened communities have been well received. 
We are working hard to take advantage of the demand strength we are seeing, with targeted pricing increases in an effort to improve our profitability. 
We did good strides on this front in third quarter and expect to make further progress in the future. 
Now I'd like to it over to John for more detail on our financial results this quarter. 
Thank you Leonard and good morning. 
For the 2020 third quarter, we generated pretax income of $1.5 million compared to $4.8 million 
pretax loss in the year ago period. 
The 2019 third quarter included a total of 3.6 million of inventory impairment charges and 
a $1.5 million loss on, on a land sale in the prior year third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $1.2 million for six cents per diluted shares. 
Compared to a net loss 4.6 million for 23 cents per diluted share in the prior year period. 
Our home sales revenue for the third quarter was 117.4 million, compared to 118.8 in the prior year period. 
The slight decrease compared to the prior year was attributable to a 22% decrease in average selling price to $748 
000, resulting from our continued expansion into lower price points, 
which was partially offset by a 27% increase in deliveries. 
We estimate 2020 fourth quarter home sales revenue to be between 115 and $125 million 
and our average selling price for the fourth quarter to be approximately $720 000. 
Our gross margin for the 2020 third quarter was 14.2% versus 9.5% in the prior year period 
and exceeded the top end of our previously issued guidance. 
The 2019 third quarter gross margin excluding impairments of $1.7 million was 11%. 
The 320 bases point improvement in gross margin, excluding the prior year impairments was primarily due to a product mix shift to a more affordable product 
which generally have higher gross margins and to a lesser extent, fewer deliveries from lower margin move up condominium communities 
compared to the 2019 third quarter. 
These positive factors were partially offset by a 60 bases point increase in capitalized interest included in cost of sales due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter. 
Excluding interest in cost of sales and impairments, 
our adjusted gross margin from home sales was 20% as compared to 16.2% in the year ago period. 
For the 2020 fourth quarter, we estimated our gross margin to be between 13.8 and 14.2%. 
Price SG&A rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the third quarter was 12.3% versus 11.1% in the year ago period. 
The higher SG&A rate in 2020 was primarily the result of higher commissions, incentive compensation and professional fees, 
hence to a lesser extent, a $300 reduction in G&A expenses allocated to fee building cost of sales. 
For the 2020 fourth quarter, we estimate our SG&A rate to be between 12.4 and 12.8%. 
The higher projected SG&A rate relative to Q-3 is partially the result of a lower anticipated allocation of G&A expenses to the fee business 
due to lower anticipated fee revenue in Q-4 due to the Irvine Pacific going down. 
We opened four new communities in Arizona during the quarter and ended the quarter with 25 active communities, which was a 14% increase compared to the prior year third quarter. 
We have one new community that opened in October and expect to sellout of approximately three communities before the end of the year. 
Fee building revenue for the 2020 third quarter was 13.4 million compared to 22.3 million in the prior year period. 
Fee building gross margin for the 2020 third quarter was 268,000 compared to 647,000 in the prior year period. 
The reduction in fee building gross margin was primarily due to lower fee building activity in Irvine California. 
For the 2020 fourth quarter, we estimate our fee building revenue to be between five and eight million dollars. 
We continue to wind down our joint ventures, 
during the quarter, we finalized the sale of our interest in the Bedford land development joint venture 
and delivered the final homes at our McKinley Village home building joint venture in Sacramento, California. 
Of the company's three remaining joint ventures, we have seven homes remaining to deliver at the Mount Shadow's home building joint venture in Arizona. 
Three home sites to sell at our Davis land development joint venture in Northern California 
and we continually to actively pursue an exist from the Russell Ranch land development joint venture in Folsom, California. 
During the third quarter, we generated $40 million in operating cash flow and reduced our net debt to capital ratio to 45.1%. 
A 980 bases point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since December 2017. 
We ended the quarter with $126 million in cash and cash equivalents and had no borrowing outstanding under our $60 million revolving credit facility. 
We also repurchased $5.2 million in principle of our senior note due 20202 at a discount. 
We further strengthened our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile, subsequent to the quarter end. 
In October, we issued $250 million of new seven and a quarter percent senior notes due October 2025, 
to refinance our existing senior notes due April 2022. 
In connection with this refinance, we estimated one time pretax charge of approximately $8 million to be recorded in the fourth quarter. 
We also entered into a new $60 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility on October 30th, that has a maturity date of April 30th 2023, 
a 
one and a half year extension from the previous bank credit facility. 
The extension of these debt maturities will allow us to make long term investments as we replenish our land portfolio and position the company for long term success. 
Lastly, we spent $14 million on land and land deposits during the quarter. 
We plan on increasing our land spend in the near future, but remain focused on maintaining a proper balance between building liquidity, 
managing leverage and rebuilding our land pipeline. 
I'll now turn the call back to Larry for his concluding remarks. 
Thanks John. We've been working hard as a company to make progress on a number fronts this year. 
And our results for the third quarter demonstrate that we have made significant headway. 
We improved our profitability by expanding our gross margins 
and further diversified our operations by continuing to close out legacy, high priced 
communities and open more affordable, faster selling communities. 
We also strengthened our balance sheet by generating strong cash flow from operations, 
reducing our net leverage and extending our debt maturity profile. 
These achievements have put us on more stable footing and give us a clear path to better results in the future. 
I wanna thank all of our team members for how they've performed during these difficult times. 
Handling the significant increase in business we've experienced, would be challenging enough during normal times, let alone in the middle of a pandemic 
and I'm really appreciative 
of your efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions. Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session. 
If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. 
A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. 
You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using computer equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key. 
Our first question comes from the line of Alan Ratner, who is <inaudible> office. Please proceed with your question. 
Hey guys, good morning. Uh, congrats on all the progress during the quarter and the strong results. 
Um, first question, um, maybe you'd start off on the pricing side, um, Larry or Leonard, 
so um, sounds like you guys have had some success pushing price in, in the quarter and obviously the, uh, longer term margin goal is, is uh, is certainly 
I think looking a lot stronger now given the pricing environment, but 
I'm curious, uh, if you could maybe just talk a little bit and quantify maybe the, a level of pice increases you guys have pushed through in the last couple of months and, 
and uh, I'm curious if, uh, you've seen any push back to any of those price increases, uh, at this point, uh, I guess 
here, early November, um, assuming some of those price increases have been more recent. 
Leonard why don't you- Thanks Alan. Why don't you take it Leonard. 
Thanks Larry. Um, thanks Alan and good morning. 
Yeah I would say across the quarter, you know we continued to push pricing at all of our communities. 
We literally raised prices at 100% of our communities 
and on average, um, the average price increase was a little over 4%. 
Um, you know, there's kinda <inaudible> communities, second home communities at the lower end and then at the higher end are really some of our suburban, 
uh, communities. We've continued to price it, uh, our purchase prices all through the quarter and really we haven't seen the resistance yet as of today, 
um, and continue to look for every opportunity we can to grow margins. 
That's great to hear. Um, second 
question, uh, you know you mentioned, and this is a similar message we've heard from other builders, just about the need to, you know, kinda slow things down a little bit and not get backlogs too far extended and 
I think that makes a lot of sense. Although for you guys, you're in a little bit of a different situation in that you, you know, you're growing off of an admittedly fairly, you know, small level of activity. 
So I was a little bit surprised that, you know, you wouldn't be in a position where you can kind of let things run a bit hotter here and I'm curious if you could talk a little bit, maybe rank order, 
the constraints that you're seeing that would prevent you from letting that go hotter for a longer period in time, in terms of your absorption rate. 
Is it, is it a land issue? I know your lot count has been trending, you know, quite a bit lower in the more recent quarters 
or is it more difficulty sourcing labor, you know, perhaps, um, you know the scale benefits that some of the larger builders have is that 
working as a disadvantage to you guys in tryna get labor in this tight environment right now? 
Yeah it's Leonard again. Try the latter of the two is driving it more or less Alan, like in a perfect world you'd sell one home per week and sell four homes per month 
and really that what our trade partners are set up for and we've kind of prepared them for that, they've made the commitment to deliver that, so 
you know, we just wanna make sure again our sold and unstarted backlog doesn't get too far out for us especially in an environment of rising prices. We know that future land prices, land's 
gonna cost more in the future 
and so really its the capacity of our trade partners, so we continue to measure that. Uh, we've gone a little bit lighter on sales releases for that reason 
and, uh, we think that's the best course of action. 
And Leonard, if I could add, I really just think it's 
varies by market and also by newer housing program or older housing program, 
so, it isn't just a, a one size fits all. 
Leonard and John have worked pretty carefully at trying to 
analyze where we have opportunities, uh, and where, um, and where there's more challenges 
and in some cases, you know, our goal is to build out of older projects and get through it. 
But, in other cases, if we're not gonna be able to start a house for two or three months, 
uh, it doesn't make any sense that we put it up for sale in a market that continues to be strong, is… 
And you know I actually think we're being very logical 
and we're attempting, uh, to maximize the profits and if you look at the communities we've opened in the last 12 months, 
you'd see a significant increase in both absorption and margin, 
uh, and, and this, we're hoping that we're gonna be able to keep that, the absorption steady 
and, uh, the margins improving, there's non reason why we shouldn't be able to. Great man, uh, 
I appreciate that extra collar there Larry. And if I could just sneak in one more here, 
um, you kind of brought up the land market a little bit, 
um, you know, what are you seeing right now, because you know, now the debt refinancing is behind you guys, you obviously have a little bit more runway and disability from the balance sheet perspective, so I would imagine, 
you know you're kind of stepping on the gas a little bit here on the land side of things and at the same time I would imagine, you know, your competitors are as well, given how strong the selling environment has been. So, 
what, what's the viability of, you know, some of those quick return deals that you could kinda put your pen and paper to and potentially get on the ground here over the next 12 or 18 months? 
Well, it's, it is- Okay, Larry. Let me just start Leonard and then you jump through. 
Um, you know, land in the markets we're in has always been challenging, always, 
and one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships that go back over 30 years, 
uh, whether with master developers or with individuals, 
um, and it is tougher now, but we're, we are continuing to find opportunities 
and, uh, uh, there is no reason why, um, we won't be able to, you know, grow the business over the next two to three years. 
But, uh, one thing you have to be aware of, and our investors 
I hope they all understand, is that when California is your strongest market 
place, uh, it takes a couple years, to, from when you buy a piece of ground, to when you're closing houses. 
And we've been planning that and we understand that that's the situation we're in, but, 
uh, don't lose track at, if anything, when the market is particularly tough, or difficult because of, uh, a lot of competition, relationships matter more than ever 
and that's one thing that we, have and we always had and we always will have. 
Um, and with that Leonard please, um, keep going. 
Yeah I think you hit most of the points Larry, I would say Alan we're certainly back in the market and we are kinda book handing this. We're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of, that we can open our model homes in 12-18 months and because of somewhat limited capital we're looking for opportunities to fill our 23 / 
24 pipeline and those, to profile those deals would look quite differently. 
The land, come market is completely, is really competitive right now as you would expect. We've had some success 
tying up some interesting opportunities and I would say Arizona is the most competitive land environment 
today and so that's probably our biggest challenge, is to identify asses that makes sense, 
there's positions available but we want to make sure they make sense and that we can deliver on those returns. 
I'd add one other thing to your prior question real quick, 
um, when you kind of talked about sales pace and running it a little bit harder, I would say even with the steps that we've taken and, you know, we just closed the month of, uh, October. 
October was a really strong month even with those measures, it's the third strongest sales month in the company's history, 
where your sales were up 65%, 
um, and we averaged, average absorption of 3.5 and that's even counting closed out communities where we have, 2 / 3 / 4 homes left to sell that kind of weighs that down a little bit. 
So, again it's still an extremely strong market and we're kind of really excited about future and what it can mean for the company. 
Great, thanks a lot guys and that sounds promising and good luck. Thanks. Thanks Alan 
Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen as a reminder if you'd like to join the question queue please press star one on your telephone keypad. 
Our next question comes from Alex <inaudible> with Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. 
Morning guys, great job. Thanks Alex. Thanks Alex. Thanks Alex. Um, I was curious, 
um, you've mentioned here starting to do some 
fee work for five point, do you have any sense of timing you can share with us when those first, uh, deliveries of 
revenues, well I guess it's more, uh, you book earning, right when construction happens, so can you kind of help, give us an idea on how to 
model that? Sure, this is, good morning Alex, this is Leonard, yeah, so, 
I'm sure you're aware it's a slightly different fee structure than say what we've done with the Irvine company in the past, and so in this case we take on 
all of the normal builder responsibilities and the communities will be branded under the New Home name, 
we sell and market the homes, construct them and then take the backend service as well. 
So the community will open during the first quarter an open for sale so that's when, you know, we will go to sell and then within the next two to three months we should see first closings. 
So the way the fee structure works is we get a portion of the fee, through the life of the project and then we get a backend, um, 
portion of the fee at the close to the home. 
So, you know, even today we'd be recognized, you know, a small amount of fee, but uh, the significant fee would start coming in probably the end of Q-1 or late Q-2. 
We're also really excited, I think it was noted in the release, that over the last six months we've been approached on several different fronts 
from, for some pretty exciting fee opportunities, including single-family rental business, where we're talking to folks in Arizona 
and we have a really exciting opportunity here in California to build up to 13 / 1400 homes. 
So we think it can drive a significant part of our business, help us grow earnings while not having to put any form of significant capital in the business. Okay great. 
And then on the joint venture side, um, another since there is very few lots left, 
is that basically winding down or will you, will that, stay alive I guess in future years? 
Hey Alex, this is John Stevens, 
uh, yeah, we are sort of winding down the joint venture business, 
um, we've got, like I said on the call, only few lots in our Davis Cannery project in Northern California, we have about, I think, seven homes 
left to deliver out of our Mount Shadow's community, 
uh, and really the remaining lots are at, uh, or Folsom Ranch deal up in Northern California, called Russell Ranch and we're in the process of existing that 
partnership right now 
and I would say in the near term we really don't have any plans to enter into any new joint ventures at this time. 
But it was possible if the right opportunity came along that would entertain that, but for now, uh, that part of the business is really winding down. 
Okay great. And then, um, if I could just ask one more on the new debt you guys just raised, 
um, is the plan to pay off the 2022 short-term, or both are already <inaudible>. Yeah it's already done. <inaudible>. 
Yeah, we effectuated that, uh, last week, we closed on the new bonds, I believe it was on the 28th of October 
and all the, the previous 22 notes have been extinguished, 
um, and, uh, so that's done. 
And then we used some of our cash on hand, um, to pay off the balance because we raised 250 million in new notes and we had about roughly 292 million of 
principle on the old notes, 
so. Okay, great, I'll get back in the queue, good job. Sure thanks 
Alex. Thank you. Our next question 
comes from line of Jason <inaudible>, with a private investor. Please proceed with your question. Thank you for taking my question guys and congratulations on the 
strong quarter. Uh, my question will only just kind of pertain to the priorities for capital deployment going forward. 
Uh, you mentioned how you successfully leveraged the balance sheet and extended all maturities, um, and the outlook for the business seems exceptionally strong, 
uh, when you guys are significantly generating cash flow, 
uh, but with just stock trading at half of book-value, well basically half a tangible book-value, it's 
hard to really imagine there's a better use the cash right now, or the part where you use the cash right now then ploughing back into the 
stock, so really, what are your thoughts around potential share repurchasing and really how can we focus and think about priorities with capital deployment going forward? 
That's a good question Jason thank you. 
Um, yeah, you know we've, we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've been very focused, as you've mentioned, 
on really deleveraging the business and refinancing our bonds and 
pushing out the revolver extension, which was a, was a big important thing that we, we'd completed on Friday, 
um, so it really puts us in a position now where we can reinvest in the business. You know obviously we did buy quite a few shares 
in the front half of the year when we saw the stock price depress very significantly and I agree with you, that trading at half, half of multiple book-value isn't, 
uh, where we'd like to be. Um, but on the, on the other hand, we do need to, uh, reinvest in our business a little bit 
and we will evaluate really all aspects and where to allocate the capital going forward. We do have a little bit left on our authorization from our board, 
I think there's about 1.7 million left authorized currently, 
um, but again we've been on pause on the land act side 
for, for a little bit now and, um, we will sort of layer some of that in going forward, um, again. 
We do need to sort of balance our capital location and it's a fair question, but we, we do need to reinvest in the business too, so we'll continue to evaluate on all funds moving forward. 
Um, John do you also want to, um, address the idea of where we are with leverage, where we came from and where you see us moving to the future? 
Yeah, I mean I think our net debt did come down significantly at 45.1% at the end of the quarter, 
um, you know its down almost 1,000 bases points from where we were a year ago, 
um, we will, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will have a charge in the refinancing of the, the old bonds, which will come through in Q-4, 
um, but moving forward, we're probably running the company with the idea of between 45 and 50% on a net debt-to-cap bases moving forward. 
Any other questions? Not from me thank you and congratulations again and good luck. Thank you, thanks Jason. Thank you. 
Our next question is a follow up from the line Alex <inaudible> from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. 
Yeah, thanks for taking my follow up. Um, so I noticed in Arizona you guys managed to open several communities this quarter, 
um, just wondering if there's anymore in the pipeline going into next year, or is this roughly gonna be the community <inaudible> through, through next year? 
Yeah Alex this is Leonard, you, you're right, um, you know the last five months we've opened seven communities in three different locations and obviously we are very excited about the early results, where we're seeing 
strong absorption and strong margins, so again, uh, we're really excited about our team there on the ground. 
We have one community slated to open in the first half of next year 
and, um, that's, you know at this point we have other things that we're currently working on, but that's primarily, uh, the one that we can talk about today. 
Yeah and it looks like we, we're, we're at eight communities now in the Q-3, I think one of them probably drops off 
in Q-4 and then we'll probably run like seven community range plus or minus for the year. Right. 
Depending on how quickly, uh, we sell through some of these communities. 
That's what we're expected for the bulk of next year, but it may tapper a little bit of Q-4 of next year until we reload the two communities we're working on now. 
Okay, great. 
Um, and then as far as gross margins, I think you gave us a range for next year, I mean for next quarter, 
which is a little bit downwards from this quarter. Is that mainly because of the impact of lumber or is there something else there? 
It, it really has to do with some of the close up communities we have on the luxury condominium side. The good news is we're selling three of 
those, the down side is that the margins are a little bit weaker in those communities with, on our higher average selling price Alex, so 
I think once those all get disposed of and delivered in Q-4, I think our margins, 
uh, look positive moving forward and again I think 13 / 8 to 14 / 
2 we felt pretty good about that, 
but again part of it is gonna be what, uh, of those higher price lower margin communities sort of deliver and close out in Q-4s is primarily the impact for the margin. 
Okay awesome, thanks. Best of luck for next year, thanks. Thanks Alex. Thanks Alex. Thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question an answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr Webb for any final comments. 
Thanks very 
much, um, as, as all of you could see, we have really made significant progress over the last three months. 
Um, and uh, when, and, and of course part of it is because of the improved housing market, 
but, uh, a part of it has been in the woks for a long time based on our strategic planning. 
And I wanted to commend, commend Leonard and John because they've really done a terrific job. 
Um, we really believe the future is bright for the New Home Company, and we're extremely excited about the next two years as we move forward. 
So, with that I wanna thank all of you and, uh, stay tuned because again there's, uh, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you. Thank you.
