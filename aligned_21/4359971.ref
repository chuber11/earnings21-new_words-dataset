Let's turn to slide five. 
At Constellium, the health and safety of our employees is our first priority. 
We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We have provided our personnel with personal protective equipment, increased cleaning and sanitation, allowed for and enforced social distancing, 
and work to raise awareness with our employees. 
I want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously and following the precautions we have put into place. 
As of last Friday, approximately one-half of 1% of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19, 
and all of whom have recovered or are recovering. 
Needless to say, we must remain vigilant. 
During the second quarter, our plants operated well despite the significant disruptions to customer demand from lockdowns in both Europe and the US. 
As I'm speaking, all our plants are running now and well. 
We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots both for the health of our employees, and any potential impacts on supply chain. 
The demand for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter, and this trend has continued into July. 
However, both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical levels. 
We took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business. 
We aggressively reduced our costs, including selecting variable costs to match production levels, reducing fixed costs, 
and lowering our targeted capital expenditures. 
Over 40% of our workforce were on some type of partial unemployment or temporary layoff scheme during the quarter. 
Where appropriate, we have also implemented permanent headcount reduction. 
Our ability to flex costs was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter. 
This was a great achievement by the entire Constellium team and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience. 
Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was €949 million, an 
increase of over €300 million compared to the end of the first quarter. 
We added an additional €50 million of liquidity in July 
through credit facilities supported by the German state, bringing our pro forma liquidity to approximately €1 billion. 
In June, we accessed the debt market to refinance our 2021 bonds. 
This transaction removed are only near-term bond maturity at a very attractive coupon. 
In conclusion, with the significant actions we have taken, I am very confident in our ability to navigate through this crisis. 
On slide six, you will see some of our highlights from second quarter of 202. 
Shipments were 310,000 metric tons, with a decrease of 25% compared to the second quarter of 201. 
Revenue decreased 33% to €1 billion. 
Of the roughly €500 million decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year, two-thirds was related to lower shipments and one-third was related to lower metal prices. 
I'll remind you that when our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices, we operate a pass-through business model to minimize middle risk. 
Net loss of €32 million compared to net income of €17 million in the second quarter of 201. 
Adjusted EBITDA of €81 million decreased 51% compared to the second quarter of 201. 
With a strong focus on cost control, we're able to offset a significant part of the volume headwinds to adjusted EBITDA across each of our business units. 
I am proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment. 
Constellium generated €228 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first half, a decline of 24% compared to the first six months of last year. 
Our free cash flow was negative €33 million in the second quarter of 202. 
These results would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures, and cash expenditures of all sorts. 
Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was €54 million. 
Based on our current view of market conditions, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 202. 
I will now hand over to Peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Peter? 
Thank you, Jean-Marc, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 
Turning now to slide eight, you will find the change in adjusted EBITDA by segments for the second quarter in the first half of 2020 
compared to the same periods of last year. 
For the second quarter of 2020, Constellium achieved €81 million of adjusted EBITDA, 
a decrease of €86 million or 51% year 
over year. PARP adjusted EBITDA of €58 million decreased by €21 million or 27% compared to last year. 
A&T adjusted EBITDA of €31 million decreased by €33 million or 51% compared to the second quarter of 201. 
AS&I adjusted EBITDA of negative €1 million decreased by €31 million compared to last year. 
Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of €7 million were €1 million higher than last year. 
In the first six months of 2020, Constellium achieved €228 million of adjusted EBITDA, 
a decrease of €74 million or 24% year over 
year. PARP adjusted EBITDA of €124 million decreased by €14 million or 11% compared to last year. 
A&T adjusted EBITDA of €83 million decreased by €33 million or 28% 
compared to the first six months of 201. 
AS&I adjusted EBITDA of €33 million decreased by €26 million or 44% compared to last year. 
Lastly, holdings and corporate costs of €12 million were €1 million higher than last year. 
We expect agency costs of approximately €20 million in 202. 
Now, turn to slide nine, and let's focus on the PARP segment. 
Adjusted EBITDA of €58 million decreased 27% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Volume was a headwind of €41 million in the quarter. 
Packaging shipments 
fell by 12% primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in March of our Neuf-Brisach plant in France due to COVID-19. 
Shipments to the North American can sheet market increased slightly year over year. 
Automotive shipments declined 54% compared to last year, as many of our automotive OEM customers curtailed production 
for April and most of May. 
Price and mix was a headwind of €2 million. Costs 
were a tailwind of €21 million due to strong broad-based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors. 
Metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we face difficult year over year comp, UBC supply chain challenges and lower metal prices. 
FX translation was a tailwind of €1 million. Now, 
now turn to slide 1. Let's focus on the A&T segment. 
Adjusted EBITDA of €31 million decreased by 51% compared to last year. 
Volume was a headwind of €46 million on lower aerospace and TID shipments. 
Aerospace shipments fell 37% compared to last year as aerospace OEMs and distributors began to reduce orders. 
TID shipments declined by 20% due to lower industrial activity in both Europe and the US. 
Price and mix was a €3 million headwind due to lower aerospace shipments. 
Costs were a tailwind of €15 million due 
to strong broad based cost control with labor, metals and maintenance as important contributors. 
Lastly, FX translation was a €1 million tailwind in the quarter. 
Now, turn to slide 11, and let's focus on the AS&I segment. 
Adjusted EBITDA of negative €1 million decreased by €31 million compared to the second quarter of 201. 
Volume was a €31 million headwind. 
Automotive shipments declined 52% compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion of the quarter. 
Industry shipments declined 16% due to lower active industrial activity in Europe. 
Price and mix was a €9 million headwinds, partially due to price and mix as a consequence of weaker market condition. 
Costs were a €9 million tailwind on strong cost control with labor, energy and fixed costs 
as important contributors. 
Lastly, FX translation was a €1 million headwind in the quarter. 
Now turning to slide 12, I want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the second quarter. 
In the second quarter, we managed to flex our costs by 83%. 
Cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 201. 
Effectively, for every dollar change in revenue, we were able to flex our cost by 83 cents. 
This compares favorably to the 75% variable cost estimate we provided last quarter. 
At the bottom of the page, you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control with PARP at 92% cost flex, and A&T and AS&I at 75%. 
To put this in context excluding metal and depreciation, 
we reduced costs by approximately €100 million compared to the second quarter of last year. 
These cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor, 
maintenance, professional fees, subcontractors and energy. 
I will note that our second quarter 2020 figures include approximately a €15 million benefit from European state employment aid related to COVID-19. 
I want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on costs. 
We will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control particularly given the uncertain demand environment. 
Now, let's turn to slide 13, and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. 
At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was 4.4 times and our net debt was €2.20 billion, 
slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of 201. 
We remain very committed to capital discipline. 
We reduced our 2020 capex target to approximately €175 million, a €96 million 
reduction from 201. 
Through the first half of 2020, we've spent €32 million less in capex than in the same period of last year. 
Our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative €33 million. 
During the quarter as a consequence of lower activity, 
our factored receivables were lower than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by €73 million. 
We would expect the reverse to occur as activity levels increase. 
Excluding the impact of factoring, 
the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter, which is a very impressive outcome in my view. 
Our free cash flow for the first half of 2020 was €54 million. 
As Jean-Marc noted earlier, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 based on our current view of market conditions. 
Generating free cash flow is a firm priority, and we remain committed to deleveraging. 
As you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page, we have no bond maturities until 202. 
During the quarter, 
we refinanced the remaining €200 million of our four and five-eighths percent notes due 2021 with 300… $325 million of five and five-eighths percent notes due 2028, 
202. 
While we initially plan to repay the 21s with free cash flow, 
we felt it was prudent to remove this near-term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions. 
Notably, this was the lowest, uh, coupon dollar bond that Constellium has ever priced, a considerable achievement in the midst of a pandemic. 
As a result of our financing activities thus far in 2020, we now expect cash interest of €150 million to €160 million. 
Our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was €949 million at the end of the second quarter. 
As Jean-Marc noted, we added €50 million to this balance in July, and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position. 
I will now hand the call back to Jean-Marc. Thank you, Peter. Let's turn to slide 1. 
I want to highlight something that is core to our business: sustainability. 
In early July, we published our 2019 business and sustainability report, which you can find on our website. 
I'd like to point out a few highlights from 201. 
Safety is our first priority. 
Our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by 10% year after year. 
Between 2016 and 2019, a recordable case rate decreased by 27%, and we are trending very well this year. 
This means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury-free every day. 
We also improved our energy efficiency by 6.40% compared to a 2015 baseline. 
That is the equivalent of 100,000 metric tons of CO2 savings every year. 
Further, we 
introduce a 2025 target to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 25% against the 2015 baseline. 
We have a detailed plan to achieve this target. 
As many of you know, recycling is a core competency at Constellium. 
Aluminum is infinitely recyclable with 75% of all aluminum ever produced still in use today. 
Muscle Shoals is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally, with the capacity to recycle over 20 billion cans every year. 
At Neuf-Brisach, we also recycle the equivalent of 12 billion beverage cans every year. 
As a company, Constellium recycled over 560,000 metric tons of externally sourced aluminum scrap in 201. 
I am also proud that third parties are recognizing Constellium for our sustainability achievements. 
The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative or ASI 
is an industry-led initiative to drive sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers. 
In 2019, we received ASI certifications for Singen's casting and rolling operation, 
and we began producing ASI-certified coils for our customers from Singen in 202. 
We also received ASI certification of our Neuf-Brisach facility under provisional COVID conditions in 202. 
We achieved the EcoVadis Platinum rating which is awarded to the top 1% of companies assessed worldwide. 
We received an ESG rating of AA from MSCI placing us in the top 5% of our sector. 
Overall, 
we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in 2019, and I look forward to continuing our progress on these very important initiatives. 
Now, let's turn to slide 16 and discuss our end markets. 
We believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets, geographies, and customers is a competitive advantage during challenging times like these. 
I'll start with the packaging market. Packaging is a core market for Constellium and represented 38% of our LTM revenue. 
We continue to see strong demand in North America, and stable demand in Europe, 
further evidenced that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth. 
We believe the packaging market as long-term secular growth tailwinds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans. 
Our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in North America just announced in the last week. 
These additional lines should drive incre- incremental demand for can sheet in the years to come. 
The consumer preference trend is only one of the tailwinds for can sheet. 
In Europe, the demand for can sheet continues to grow based on substitution of aluminum for steel. 
In the US, we continue to expect the growth of auto body sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term. 
Now, let's move to automotive over. 
Over long term, automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum. Customers continue to prefer larger vehicles. 
With regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the automotive market will need to continue to lightweight. 
In addition, we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the fleet. 
These vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the importance of light weighting to achieve their range objectives. 
Constellium is well positioned to realize the benefits of this circular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the fleet. 
Moving to more recent trends, automotive OEMs began curtailing production in March and largely resumed production in May. 
while demand from our customers increased significantly in June, we have experienced uneven demand for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots. 
While we are optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of 2020, the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the OEM. 
Let's turn now to aerospace. 
Aerospace represented 15 of our LTM revenues. 
The near-term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from COVID-19 and the 737-Max. 
Aerospace OEMs have reduced build rate, and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels. 
We expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 will be lower than the level in the second quarter of 202. 
In TID, we expect to continue to expand in niche products in a diversified range of markets over the long term. 
In the near term, the defense and rail markets remain strong. But most industrial and transportation markets remain weak. 
These markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in Europe and North America. 
It is unclear when and to what extent these markets will rebound. 
In closing, I, again, want to thank the Constellium team for their tireless efforts during this trying time. 
We remain committed to operational execution, harvesting the benefits of our investments, discipline capital deployment, debt reduction, and shareholder value creation. 
With that, Joanna, we will now open the Q&A session. 
Thank you, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press star, then the number one on your touch-tone telephone. 
If your question has been answered or you wish yourself, uh, to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. 
Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Chris, if you are on mute, unmute. 
Chris, you line is now open. 
Hi, Jean-Marc and Peter. Can you hear me? Yeah, we can. Good morning, Chris. Good morning. Um, thanks for taking my question. 
Um, the first thing I wanted to start with was just the utilization rates and the comments from 1Q. You sort of stepped through 
how you saw utilization in each of the divisions for 2Q and then perhaps for 3Q and 4Q. Appreciate you don't have guidance but I wondered 
whether you could maybe conceptually talk through, um, 
3Q versus 4Q and just versus 2Q or any comments you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter. Thanks. 
Sure, Chris. So I'll start with the markets and then gonna of translate it into what it can mean for the divisions, right, or the business units. 
So when you look at our second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year, 
right, you 
see packaging roughly 10% down. You see, uh, 
automotive, 50% down. You see aerospace 40% down, right, roughly. 
And the other markets and each market is about 25% down. 
This is made of very different dynamics, right? So in packaging, what we are seeing now is 95% utilization. 
There was a bit of a drop, uh, especially in April with all the lockdowns in Europe, uh, redu-reduction in, uh, canned consumption and all that, 
but that has come back pretty strong, and the US continues to be quite strong. 
So we look at, you know, packaging again recession resilient, uh, secular growth 
and we're pretty, uh, confident for the second half of the year, 
and we look at the Q2 as being a kind of an abnormal quarter because of all that happened, uh, in April and a little bit in May. 
If I look at automotive, uh, it has re-snapped back. I mean I think when we talked on Q1, we're talking of 20% utilization as we were speaking. 
And now, we're at above 80%, right? 
If you do the average of 20 and 80, you- you get to 50 which is about what we experienced in the second half in terms of reduction in their shipments. 
It is, um… you know, 
it seems like it can be stronger than 80%, 
uh, going forward. We certainly are running very well in July but we've seen, uh, that this, uh, restart has been with all kinds of fits and stops, right? 
So you got upstarts, you've got supply chain disruptions, you've got, 
uh, uh, difficulties in bringing products from Mexico, uh, building, uh, trucks in Texas. It's challenging. 
So, you've got all those, uh, you know, operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with. 
Uh, but, clearly, the demand seems to be, you know, 
well in excess of, uh, 80% of where we were 
last year. So that- that's encouraging and, hopefully, uh, you know, COVID-19 doesn't, uh, throw too much of a wrench in that, uh, good trend. 
If I look now at aerospace, where we were running at around 60% in the quarter, uh, we expect more pain in the second half of the year. 
And I think the- the reason for that is it's a long supply chain. 
Um, and the customers, uh, you know, move a little bit more slowly in terms of, uh, adjusting their orders, 
uh, and that- that is creating a bit of a, of a lag in terms of, uh, how- how much pain we take. 
We are in very, uh, detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the second half ought to look like, and why, contractually, 
we could force some volumes on us that's not our type. 
What they don't need, we don't want to force on them. 
So what we're working through is, uh, taking more pain now in the second half so that 2021, we start with a clean slate. 
So we would expect some reduction in the operating rates in aerospace in, uh, in the second half of the year. 
So if you translate all that into what it means for, uh, the different BUs, I would expect PARP, packaging, and automotive to be better. 
I would expect AS&I, automotive, uh, structures 
essentially, to be better in the second half and would expect A&T to be a more challenge in the second half. 
Yeah. Thanks, thanks so much. 
And you… sorry. No, go ahead. I- I'll just sort of follow up on packaging specifically where the volumes are down at, you know, around about 10%, I think, year on year. 
And you're saying Muscle Shoals is doing well. It seems like the US is going, going well. I think Crown yesterday mentioned that Southern Europe was weak. 
Can you just comment a little bit further about packaging 
in the EU region? Is it… was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had facilities offline, and maybe you could quantify some of the EU impacts. Yeah, 
I think… So- so the reason I'm, uh, saying more than 90% or 95%, whatever, and that's 100% is exactly because of some, uh, weakness in Europe. Right? 
And I think it's got to do with, uh, uh, both, uh, you know, the- the- the reduction in, uh, activity in Southern Europe. I mean a lot of these countries have, uh, economies 
that are based on tourism. And, you know, this is not the best year for tourism as we all know. 
Uh, and, uh, we are seeing, you know, there's little clusters and hotspots, so everybody's a bit, you know, vigilant as they should be. Right? 
So that is weighing down a little bit on, uh, canned consumption in Europe, yes. 
Okay. And- and just… Sorry, I had, uh, one follow-up on- on, uh, on- on working capital specifically. 
I just wanted, maybe Pe- Peter if you could talk through the, you 
know, the 2Q moving parts. Obviously, you've stepped through those waterfall charts and you're getting cost… doing a great job on the cost side. 
I just wondered if 
you're coming a little bit further on the second half of the year, 
um, and what the opportunities are that… on working capital, 
uh- Sure. in 
terms of, uh, you're saying positive for the full year. You've already, obviously, hit the positive number at the halfway point so just- just wondering if you talk through the moving parts of working capital. 
Sure, happy to do it. And just for context, so, 
um, the second quarter as we said last, uh, quarter, we- we would, uh, use working capital and we, in fact, burned 63 million of working capital in the, 
um, in Q2. And for the first half, we're positive 2. 
So based on where we sit today, 
I think it's, uh, plausible to think that, you know, with auto ramping, with packaging, uh, kind of continuing to ramp back up, 
uh, that- that we could lose some ground in the, in the back half of the year. 
So, uh, not a huge negative but we could see working capital being, uh, used in the back half of the year. 
Um, but, Chris, I would say that, uh, we remain confident in spite of that, that we, uh, we can achieve a free cash flow position. 
Thanks, thanks, Peter. That's, uh, that's it for me. Thank you. Okay. Good. 
Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from The Benchmark Company. Your line is open. 
Hey, good morning. Good morning, Josh. 
Yeah, just a question. You know, how are you thinking, you know, any tariffs on Canadian aluminum? 
You know, have you increased any inventory expecting that or- or- or just what should we be thinking on that front of that if that comes to fruition? 
Yeah, well… I mean, we believe it's a misguided, uh, measure if it happens, right? We- we've lobbied against it in the past. We got it removed. It may come back. 
Um, we think it's misguided and it doesn't address the problem which is over capacity from China, from a non-market economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do. 
Now, that said if it happens, it's got a very limited impact on us. So 
I remind you that, uh, we pass through the metal. Um, cost essentially to, uh, most of our customers, 
there may be a little, uh… the section of the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens. 
Uh, but on the other side, we may gain a little bit more on scrap, uh, recycling as well, so not much of an impact for us. 
Uh, the reason we're against it is much more a matter of principle because we believe in free and fair trade 
than really a problem for our, uh, finances or our e- economic, uh, outcome. 
Got it. And then just on- on the canned sheet front, 
you know, can you remind us of, you know, when the… you know, you- your larger contracts are- are up for renegotiation and then just any comment around, you know, pricing strength? 
Yeah, so we… Um, so we don't go into the details of exactly which contracts mature when, 
uh, but, uh, you know, that we've got a few renewals coming in, uh, around the, uh, 22 horizon. 
Uh, we are making good progress, 
uh, and I think the pricing environment is, uh, 
I would describe it as a mildly positive in the US and widely negative in Europe because of the specific situation now. 
I remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here. 
And, uh, whilst we, you know, I say it's mildly positive here and mildly negative there, between now and whenever we actually ink a contract, things may change. 
Uh, but I think it's a pretty benign environment. 
And our product is in demand. Uh, I'll brag a little bit. Our quality and our service is very much recognized. 
Muscle Shoals has done a terrific job in, uh, over the past five years, 
uh, and is a very strong player in the market now, very recognized, quality service-wise. 
Neuf-Brisach has always been. 
So we have, uh, strong positions and I'm, uh, looking at the future with a great deal of, uh, confidence. Great. 
Thank you. 
That's it. Thanks. Thanks, Josh. Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Um, first of all, I did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter. Did you say there was a $15 million one-time benefit included in the $81 million adjusted EBITDA line? 
You're talking about for the, uh, for the labor benefit? 
I thought it was a COVID-19 state aid benefit. Is that included in <crosstalk>? Yeah. That's included in adjusted EBITDA. 
But it's not a one-off and it continues. Those programs are what is referred to as <inaudible> or short-time work and 
these government programs continue through 
2020 and, in some cases, into 
202. Okay. So, we should assume about a $15 million quarterly benefit those programs each quarter? Well, no because what will happen David is remember, 
so in the second quarter, we had a lot of people on the sidelines right but as we ramp up, then we're going to have substantially less of that. 
I think you should assume that, uh, in the businesses that it, you know… It's gonna… so packaging, for example, where we had some benefit in- in, 
uh, Q2, we should have, you know, basically very limited if- if any benefit in- in- 
Yeah. Q3 and, uh, you know, automotive which should fade away and- and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating utilization rate there but it'll be a much lower number. 
To give you an indication, I… we mentioned about people being, uh, you know, unemployed during the quarter. At the trough which is behind us, 
uh, we had 6,000 people under some kind of unemployment benefit or, you know, temporary layoff. 
Now, we are at less than 2,000.0. So it's- it's closed dra- dramatically. 
Yeah. And- and David, just to put it in perspective the, uh… you know, if you get to the fourth quarter, the number might be something like 25 of that, 
right, just based on the utilization, rate just rough number. 
Okay. That's actually helpful. Thank you. 
And then just in terms of the, um, you know, the- the- the individual, uh, and market commentary, 
on the aerospace side, obviously, that's the or has been, you know, the highest margin business, 
um, and- and, you know, just in terms of the outlook commentary, 
you- you- you framed obviously, uh, two segments up, one segment down but, you know, the down segment is- is again the highest margin segment. 
I didn't really get a census to order magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers. Can you just give us a sentence to, you know, do you believe that aerospace will completely offset 
the recovery in auto and- and packaging, um, in the second half or- or- or a bit more, uh, you know, color on magni- order of magnitude on the, on the decline in aerospace would be helpful? 
So it's very difficult to tell, uh, David because we're, as we speak, in a very active discussions with our customers. 
And at the end of the day, it's a call that we have to make jointly with them. 
As I mentioned, we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some product, 
uh, which they will take and pay for all, but then they don't need it the following year, right, so they all… they… all the inventory they are holding back. 
So we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need 
which, by the way, I don't think they fully know now, uh, and it's no criticism of them. I mean it's very unusual time. 
And once we know what they need and we look at what cuts do we take, then I could answer your question, possibly. 
At this stage, I cannot. I would just say that there will be for sure more pain in, uh, in, uh, other structures 
and then the, you know, those structures… in aerospace, my apologies, aerospace. 
Now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past, 
the second half is always w- weaker than the first half, 
right, in aerospace. 
So- Right. that- that's something to factor in as well. 
Okay, and just m- my last related question is, um, the- the- the… I think you mentioned, 
I think average utilization rates for aerospace related, um, demand in this, in the second quarter was around 60%- Correct. <inaudible> facilities. Is that right? What is that number now? 
Uh, we're running still around that number but I would expect it to, uh, go down 
maybe to 50%, that kind of range. 
Okay, all right, that's helpful. Thanks very much. Okay. 
Yeah, it's very… uh, it's important to say we're not expecting it to go down to 30%, right, even that's- that's… not, uh, not on the horizon. 
Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yeah, hi, good morning. Hi, Curt. Hi, Curt. Uh, 
Peter, first question on- on the €100 million of cost reductions, 
how much of that would you view as structural? And then, you know, I guess just in general in terms of the amount of costs you think you could take out of the business 
this year on a permanent basis, can you give us an update on- 
on those efforts? 
Um, so, um, if we look, if we look at the… uh, I mean so the biggest piece of that hundred million, uh, is related to labor, 
right? So x… and that's- that's probably… labor's probably, you know, half of that hundred million. 
So, uh, 
what we're doing now is we are really closely looking at the business and, you know, what it's likely to be like for the next couple years and 
then you're trying to size our labor forces according to that. 
So, uh, in that regard, I think, we would expect that there's going to be some, uh, kind of permanent savings. 
But remember, as we, uh, kind of ramp up the operations, 
uh, we do expect some of that cost is gonna come back, 
right? So, um, you know, I'd say it's hard to give a- a really precise number o- on that, Curt. It's, uh, it's a difficult one, yeah. Okay. Um, 
Kurt, if I may add. 
Uh, we have talked about Horizon 22, right, and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at 
how do we, um, lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities 
but how do we lean and make the organization stronger? 
And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us, uh, and I guess to many other companies out there is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented. 
So along the lines that Peter was, 
uh, saying, I think we'll come out of this with some permanent cost reductions. And as we ramp up, we will not ramp up and inject back 100 million of costs. 
Uh, how much, you know, wi- will remain to be seen because we're really, 
uh, learning as we're doing and we're just in the middle of it now but, uh, we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger. 
Yeah, and there's certain categories like, for example, professional fees, 
subcontractors where, you know, kind of as we work without these because those are, you know, kind of big categories of reduction, 
I think we, uh, were able to, uh, to kind of live without a lot of that going forward. 
So- so, yeah, I think there- there's- there's definitely a p- piece of that that we can carry forward. 
Sure. And then just to give an example that are not- not trivial, they're quite revealing, right? 
So we've got a very strong, uh, you know, R&D and technical support organization which is, you know, people that are centrally located and then go and, uh, help plants. 
And, uh, historically, a lot of the work was done by people going to the location. 
Now, obviously, in the past three months, nobody's been able to travel anywhere. 
And a lot of that has been done through a remote interaction, uh, video conference. But even when you go to a- to a plant, 
and you look at… I got a problem and I need to, uh, improve, uh, the speed on this mill, 
we've had people, you know, interacting by the <inaudible> bit 
on a Facetime and, uh, going into… uh, looking into the- the roller, uh, 
the- the- the rolling mills, uh, by Facetime with a, uh, technical advisor on the other side of the planet. And that works actually fine, 
which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible. So in the future, what you're gaining here is, well, you're saving travel time 
which is not very good for the aerospace business, 
but also your… say, you're- you're the… because you're saving the cost, you're saving the time which means that people can be on several interventions 
whilst, historically within a week, you know, it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done. 
So I think we're- we are going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our, 
uh, you know, space that are going to be quite interesting in the future. And I think it's gonna help us inject more brain and talent, uh, remotely with more, uh- 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. <inaudible>. Yeah, and Curt, you know, as we go forward we'll, uh… we may be able to give you more color on this 
but, you know, hopefully, it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out 
and, in the short term, uh, the objective is we wanna be, you know, kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis. 
Um, and so that we don't take on any incremental debt, ideally. 
And in the longer term, we want to emerge with a, you know, kind of much stronger earnings power. 
So we're focused on exactly that and- and, uh, you know, we'll have more to say as- as we progress. 
Okay, now that- that's helpful. 
And then, you know, in terms of the- the free cash 
flow, um, you know, dynamics, you mentioned I think a $73 million impact from, uh, factoring this quarter or, otherwise, you'd be free cash flow positive which is pretty- pretty positive given your utilization rate. And now you're talking about 95% utilization and packaging over 80%, and auto… 
and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized. So, you know, 
75% of your business is… could be close to 90% utilization in a couple months. I get that arrow is weaker, 
um, but it would seem like, from a free cash flow generation standpoint, um, you know, unless working capital would be a major negative, you- you 
should be generating decent free cash in the- the back half of the year. Can you, can you comment at all on free 
cash flow potential in the back half of the year? 
Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So we won't put a specific number 
on it but, uh, we're confident that we will generate free cash flow, um, for the full year. 
Um, and, you know, the back half of the year, I think, there's a, 
there's a very good chance that we can, you know, generate some free cash flow. But it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital. As I said, we've got, you know, the ramp of these businesses. 
So we want to be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp, um, and the consequences of the ramp. 
Um, but again for the full year, we- we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow. Okay. 
And then just final question on arrow, Jean-Marc. You had a comment on, 
I guess, working with the OEMs to create, uh, you said a clean slate entering 202. 
So, you know, 
is that, um, statement kind of reflecting the fact that the OEMs cut very quickly, and I assume there's sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or, in general, in the supply chain. 
And so, 
you know, um, hypothetically, your- your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help them clear inventory, so then when you get into 2021, you 
know, the supply chain is in, is in a pretty good position 
and, you know, contractually, you said you're not going to force it on them but then, you 
know, if you're going to help them manage that, do they… do you get any- anything in return, i.e. 
you know, price benefit or, you know, this is kind of everyone helping each other, just a little bit understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comment. 
Well, yeah, uh, no, fair question. So, um, 
I think I've commented in the past 
on the fact that I thought that the shipments we're making into the, uh, to the OEMs, right, into the supply chain were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time. 
And obviously, the build rates are going down, very significantly down. 
So now… so the- the pain we're gonna take in the second half, 
I think, is not going to cure all the, uh, you know, uh, inventory build-up in the supply chain, first of all. 
Uh, but I think what that does is it positions us for 2021 that doesn't show further deterioration. 
That's what we're- we're into, right, and we want to be in a place where- where we supply, by and large, consistent with what is being built, right? 
So that- that's what we're trying to do. Whether we get there fully, I don't know 
but, certainly, we are aiming to be better in ' 21 than what the second… the nine months of, uh, you 
know, post- COVID, uh, will be in, 
uh, A&T. That's- that's one of the goals. 
Um, in terms of what we're getting from, uh, 
the OEMs, uh, we've got very strong deep strategic relationships with them. Uh, 
I've commented also in the past from the fact that we're in it for the long haul. 
And I think it's, uh, evidenced by the 10-year contract we've signed with Airbus… I mean, uh, 10-year is a long duration, never happened before. 
And, uh, we did it, uh, because it was the right thing to do for both, uh, companies, for both businesses, 
and we didn't do it as a reaction to COVID or whatever, right? I mean that was really the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies. 
So we're looking past the current crisis. 
The current crisis, we've got to get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and, uh, put us in the same place work, together to overcome the crisis 
and we are not talking about, you know, if I do that, you give me a bit more price or whatever. 
I think it's just a relationship where we want to be in the win-win partnership 
and we do some, uh, things that help them. And they'll do some things that help us in the future which they have already done in the past and that's already, uh, that's already happened, and that's continuing. 
Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields from Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Hey, Jean-Marc. Hey, Peter. Um, one on the, on the markets and then one on the balance sheet, please. 
Um, 
so, you know, saw that can volumes were down about 11% but, um, you know, Norsk, uh, reported canned volumes up 11%. 
I think you guys face relatively the same markets in Europe. Can you, can you sort of point to why maybe they're having more success 
on their can volumes? Was it, was it enough for Neuf-Brisach being down issue or- or a market issue or what… like what? Can you just explain that discrepancy for us, please? 
Sure. It's mainly, I believe… I mean I cannot comment on their, uh, specific, uh, situation but in- in our case, 
the main reason was that we had to take down Neuf-Brisach for a full week 
and then ramp it up gradually. 
I remind you that Neuf-Brisach was at the center of a hot spot of the first, uh, real hot spot in France, 
uh, and that was a very, uh, very terrible conditions for, uh, you know, second half of March. 
So in March, we continued to ship out of Finnish goods but then we had to replenish the, 
uh, the- the Finnish goods and that really took down our, uh, you know, our shipments in the second quarter. But we're back to normal 
now. Okay. That's, uh, that's sort of what I expected. 
Um, and on the balance sheet, it looks like you got, um, a decent amount of funding from- from France and, um, and obviously Switz- Switzerland and- and Germany. 
Um, you said it was partially guaranteed 
but it's also secured. Can you just give us a- a, um, a- a- a better understanding of sort of what it's secured by? Is it inventory or is it sort of PPE? 
And then to what extent is it guaranteed by the French government? 
Well it, uh, depends on the facility but the big one, the French one is secured on- on, uh, uh, PP&E. 
Um, and, uh, in the case of the German ones, one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured. And the Swiss one is unsecured. 
Um, and, uh, the guarantees what… the way they work is they guarantee a certain percentage of the principal. 
So, uh, it's a normal syndicate of banks with, 
uh, in the case of France, I think the guarantee is for 70% of the, uh… or sorry, 80% percent of the… in the case of France of the, 
um, of the principal balances guaranteed by the, by the French state. 
In the case of Germany, I think it's, uh, 80% too. 
So just- just for- for our purposes as credit analysts, 80% of that French loan is- is sort of non-recourse to you? 
Well, again it's, uh, it is, it is recourse to us. 
Uh, what I think t- t- the point is- is that if you're a lender, 
so for example, if you're in the syndicate of banks and you, uh, are lending say 50%, your responsibility is for 10… oh, sorry 
50%, 50 million, your responsibility is for 10 of that. 
Right? So the… it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee, not- not the company. 
Okay, so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks. 
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Okay. 
But one thing <crosstalk>… Yeah, I'm sorry. 
Go ahead. The- the government is, in fact, stopping the loan for you. It's not stopping the loan for- for the banks. Exactly, exactly. 
But one thing to, you know, kind of I think is a really important point is, 
you know, our- our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet 
was to remove any question about the fact that we had e- enough liquidity. 
As we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter, we do not anticipate using this. So the French facility we had to draw 
just by the terms of the agreement but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash, 
and, uh, the German facility that we've now signed up in July, you know, we don't expect to draw that. 
Uh, the DD, uh, the delay draw term loan, we haven't drawn that. Uh, and the Swiss facility, uh, we don't have that drawn in- in most instances so- 
And the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through, uh, very cheap interest rates. Yeah, that's right. Right? So- 
That's right. that's right cheap money and that- that was important to us. 
We don't think we need the money, so we're not gonna to pay a lot of, uh, interest for it. Yeah, exactly that, and it obviously was an inducement for the banks to lend, 
right? Now, fair enough. And that's, uh, you know, I think the French facility is, what, 2.50% effectively at this point? 
Yeah, yeah. That's the code. All right, so you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly, you know, given your- your bonds are kind of twice 
that, right? Uh, no- no, that's right. 
Now, remember the- the, uh, the use of the cap… there are some limitations on the use of the capital, right? So for example, we can't use that capital to go and, 
uh, buy back bonds in the market. 
So it's really meant to be for, uh, you know, kind of operating needs of a company. 
But, yeah, you're right we don't have a… we don't have a strong incentive to- to repay that. 
Okay, and then it- But- but what we will… what we will do is, you know, obviously there's some cost to it, right? 
So as we, uh, kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility then we'll unwind those facilities. 
Okay. That's, uh, that's very helpful. Thanks for all the color and- and good luck in the back half. Thank you. Thank you. 
Your next question comes from the line of Sean Warnock from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And, uh, really great job on transparency and costs here. Uh, both very helpful. 
Thanks, Sean. Um, just when you think about big picture, if you look at the auto market, 
um, there are sort of projections out in the market that will have about, you know, 25%, uh, decline in new cars this year, 
you know, mostly based on the fact that we weren't producing back in March/April. Um, 
if you look at the used auto market, you know, it's been pretty strong as we've used prices really, uh, you know, rising even above last year. 
Um, you know, you talk about how production's been increasing and demand is increasing there. 
Um, you know, to kind of get to down 25%, you know, you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in- in 3Q and three-four. 
So I- I guess what I'm asking is, 
do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon, 
um, you know, with demand pulling through based on- on a lack of cars? And if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there, that'd be very helpful. 
Yeah, so, um, I mean the older book is strong. There's no question. It's above the 80% that I'm mentioning, right? 
Uh, but we've been a little bit caught, 
uh, you know, by customers, uh, just a few months ago telling us, uh, we need product tomorrow, and then telling us the next day the plant is shut down, right? 
So, you know, we are very vigilant, right? 
So I hope… I- I think the end demand is there. 
I think that's TRUE in the US, that's TRUE in Europe, right? 
The governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers, right, through the, 
uh, the unemployment benefits of, you know, different shapes and forms that you see on both continents. 
And that is, you know, pretty good for, uh, end demand at the end of the day. 
So I hope it's gonna be, uh, it's 
gonna materialize into and the older book we have is going to be actually real orders and shipments, in which case, it could be better. 
Uh, but, you know, I've, 
uh, we- we- we- we've seen fits and starts. You see, uh, plants restarting and then, uh, shutting down because, uh, there's, uh, 
COVID infections or you see people having, uh, trouble, uh, stashing, you know, the full shift because there's uh, uh, too many cases in the, in the hot spots. 
So i- i- i- i- it's still fragile. I mean it looks, uh, quite good but it's still fragile. Right. 
That's helpful thank you, Jean-Marc. I guess that's a good lead into the next question. 
So when- when you think about your customers, um, you know, we- we've had some shutdowns, um, we've had things come back online. 
Do you, do you feel that your customers and their CEOs are- are getting more confident in their ability to stay online. They're getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curve there? eah, I- 
I would think so. I think all of us have, uh, made, 
uh, tremendous, uh, efforts to, uh, provide the proper environment from, uh, for our, uh, employees. 
Uh, it's very interesting. I- I was commenting on the- the, you know, half of a percent of our e- employees have been affected by COVID, uh, confirmed. 
Um, we have had no new case, confirmed case in Europe since the middle of May. Wow. 
So I think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility, 
uh, in their daily lives, right, because it goes beyond what they do within our factories or during the eight hours or 10 hours, whatever that they work with us, 
uh, you can have an impact. 
And I think, you know, 
if people wear masks when they interact with, uh, outside, uh, which people, uh, they- they come across, I think it makes a tremendous difference. 
Uh, so I hope the reality will slowly or more- more than slowly, 
uh, settle in and, uh, and good practices will, uh, get that, uh, virus a- away from us, uh, sooner rather than later. 
And I think- Got you. people are seeing the- the confidence building up. 
I mean, it's human nature. You need to be affected to take steps, and I think we're in the process where, in many places, people are still being affected before they take steps. 
But if you look at China, I mean China is, you know, going extremely strong. 
Uh, you know, it's a small operation for us but we are above budget, above last 
year, right? Uh, you look at Europe, 
no n- new cases are really, uh, on a downward trend even though there are some clusters here and there, and we're seeing a stronger, 
uh, reco- rebound, 
and I hope this is coming, uh, to us 
in the US, throughout the US. That's great. That's good to hear, Jean-Marc. And I- I hope everybody's safe and well over there. Thank you very much, um, and- and good luck. Thank you. Well, <crosstalk>- Go ahead, Sir. Oh, go ahead, Joanna. Um, yes, Sir. 
I am showing no further questions at this time. 
I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Jean-Marc Germain, CEO of Constellium. Go ahead. 
Thank you, Joanna. So thanks every- thanks everyone, uh, for, uh, participating in the call today. 
As you can see we are very focused on, uh, uh, facing the crisis protecting, uh, cash flow and, uh, 
building a stronger Constellium when things are behind us. 
Thank you very much and look forward to, uh, updating you on our progress, uh, on… in Q3. Take care. Stay well. Thank you, speakers. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
