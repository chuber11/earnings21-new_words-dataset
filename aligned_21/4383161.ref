Thank you, Dunham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. 
For the third quarter of the 2020, we reported net revenues of 3.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $305 million or a 9.90% margin, 18% higher than a year ago, 
and then adjusted gap EPS of 66 cents. 
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our global team for their continuing commitment, dedication and hard work in supporting our ability to keep our team members safe and healthy 
by maintaining our ability to produce and supply customers during this challenging time. 
I cannot be more proud of our team what they have continued to come together to support one another, our customers and consumers. 
Safety is a condition at Pilgrim's and our team members responded admirably to the unprecedent conditions supplying products to our customers. 
We're continuously adapting our global operations to the changing channel demand 
while adjusting our operations to be able to maintain the operations at all our plants and minimize any significant disruption due to labor and health issues. 
We remain diligent in implementing precautionary practice steps to better safeguard the wellness and health of each team member 
while fulfilling our official duty as a food producer to consumers in every region where we operate. 
We incurred direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly 27 million for the quarter and close to 77 million year-to-date. 
The direct costs are related to the extra cleaning of our production and common areas. 
The extra PP and E including masks and face shields that we are providing to all, all of our team members and installation of physical barriers in our production areas. 
We also installed dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every point to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. 
We are offering free LiveHealth online services that allow for virtual doctor visits at no costs, and above all CDC guidelines, 
we remove vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. 
These figures includes, uh, indirect costs. There are more, 
there are a lot of indirect costs. They are more difficult to precisely quantify, 
such as overall disruptions to our operations, less optimal mix and production efficiencies that are not included in these numbers. 
Also, we are supporting our communities with our home strong initiative. 
It is an example of how we value the important role we play in the communities where our team members live and work. 
We understand the responsibility that comes with being a major employer in rural communities. 
And we work hard to contribute to the well being of those communities by not only providing gainful employment opportunities, 
but also participate in, in voluntaries, donation and sponsorship opportunities. 
This quarter we accrued $50 million in SG&A for this initiative. 
Turning to the specifics of our business, 
despite continuing volatility in challenging market environments in Q3, and added operating costs, 
we have continued to generate a superior relative performance to the competition and has remained resilient to market fluctuations. 
This is a reflection of our portfolio approach, including the strategy on well diversified 
products, broad geographical footprints, and the relentless focus on key customers. 
For the full quarter operating performance, both in the US and Mexico significantly improved sequentially, 
and Europe also continue to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19. 
In Q3, we saw market conditions continue to recover across all of our global operations 
with the US and particularly Mexico experiencing the strong rebound in performance relative to weak conditions during the first half of the year. 
We are pleased with the results especially when taking into account all the disruptions, less than optimal product mix and added operating costs when compared to the environment in 201. 
Despite continued challenge in global market conditions due to COVID-19, our consolidated results have also 
remained well balanced and the results of our revision to become the best and most respected company creating the opportunity for a better future for our team members. 
To support our vision, we are continuing to implement our strategy of developing a unique portfolio diverse complementary business models, 
continue to relentlessly pursue operational excellence, becoming a more valued partner with key customers and creating an envi- environment for safe people, 
safe products and healthy additives. 
While market conditions in all our global operations are continuing to improve during the quarter, 
food service demand, globally, still has not reached prior levels. And the environments are still quite challenging some sectors where we operate. 
Disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption, as well as for the flow of global trades 
and generates volatility far beyond normal seasonal factors. 
We will maintain our strategy while continuing to improve the portfolio to better respond to individual market dynamics and generate a relative increase in performance over our peers. 
We believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the mid to long run and then minimize the full peaks and troughs of the commodity sectors. 
During the third quarter in the US, we have continued to see demand recovering at our fresh operations, including from some sectors within food, food service, 
with more states gradually losing travel and movement restrictions. 
QSR volume has been specially strong and demand from our customers has been outperforming the industry. 
Similar to last quarter, commodity large bird deboning was also again the most challenged during Q3. 
Operationally, however, we continue to improve our re- relative performance versus the industry across all business units. 
We're continuing to adapt to the shipping channel demand by increasing our volume mix to key customer retailers. 
In addition, a large portion of our food service customers are also within the QSR segments, which has further dampened the impact across our fresh business unit models. 
Our portfolio of differentiated products along with our key customer model are giving us better insulation against the volatility. 
We're also much better positioned to adjust products and channel mix, given our presence across all birds sizes from small to large. 
Within the small bird and case-ready segments, market supply and demand was again very well balanced during Q3. 
Demand from retailers, especially from our key customers are strong support in improving performance of our case-ready business. 
Our market leadership in this category and more differentiated product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive advantage versus the industry. 
While we're committed to our key customer strategy has been reflected in the consistency for our past results. 
The value of this approach have never been more relevant to our growth than during the current times of great uncertainties and challenges. 
To further support the growth of key customers, 
we are doubling our case-ready capacity at our plant in Minnesota 
by increasing the number of heads process at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable margin case-ready products. 
With this addition, we also expect to increase by 20% of production of our differentiated, higher attributes Just BARE brand products. 
It is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large bird deboning to a key customer QSR in the small bird segment. 
The strong relationships we have to key customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth. 
In addition, many of our key customers maintain a leadership position in their respective categories. 
As a result, we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition. 
Beyond rising peer growth, our key customer strategy also promotes trust, enhances long term relationships and strengthen our margin structure. 
In the US, prepared foods business, revenue declined 23%, on 26% less volume year over year. 
A large part of this decrease, 70% of the volume was driven by schools remaining close partially offset by strengthening the retail demand. 
On the other hand, our margin from sales has improved 29% driven by more favorable price and mix. 
We continue to simplify our portfolio to improve efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel. 
Our Pilgrim's Brand sales grew 52% and our Just BARE brand gaining new distribution resulting in dollar share growth in the retail channel. 
Turning to cold storage data, at the end of August, broiler inventory was up 2% from the close of Q2, but down 1% from the previous year. 
Last quarter inventories were up 10% compared to last year. 
This is not surprising considering the mix simplification due to ongoing labor constraints seen during Q3 
and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of COVID-19. 
And so markets reopened and the pipelines are empty. We are seeing some increasing leg quarter sales during October and a reduction in inventories and upward movement in prices. 
US poultry exports including pork were up 4.70% year over year throughout August. 
Broiler meat alone was up 3%. 
In contrast, uh, through Q3, our exports have increased by 14% year over year, outpacing the market. 
China continues to be a significant growth driver. And we believe the impact of ASF in Southeast Asia and now Germany can provide further support to export demand. 
As we approach the one year anniversary of China reopening to US poultry, producers are presented with a vastly different market landscape than a year ago. 
China has solidified itself as one of the largest exporter destinations for poultry second only to Mexico. 
China's presence as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority. 
We have added 95 new direct clients in 2020 and have also continued to diversify our products and destination mix. 
The use of non-traditional export items are up 30% year over year, which strengthens the cut out margin. 
We enter Q4 with optimism as we continue to place commodity items efficiently, 
leverage business overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exceptional customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world. 
After a very challenging first half in 2020, our Mexican operations deliver great results in Q3 
and we record in one of the strongest Q3 in the company's history. Despite the unfavorable mix, impacted and added operation costs re- relative to the same period last year. 
More normalized economic activities and improved supply demand balance in the market 
are increased share of non-commodity products and our very good operational performance all contribute to the results. 
Although, overall demand is improving, we remain agile, and are continuing to adapt our facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relative demand. 
Prepared foods in Mexico experienced some challenges, especially in the value categories due to less traffic on retail combined with a contraction in the QSR volume. 
But we begin to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter. And we believe that positive trends can be sustained into Q4. 
We remain committed in long term growth and demand prospects in Mexico. 
We have continued to invest in our Del Dia and premium Pilgrim's brand both in fresh and in prepared 
as well as seeing key more market share in the modern channel which will bring more stable margins to our operations. 
Our European chicken operations, delivered an EBIT in Q3 that was 13% sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenue 7% and 18% higher respectively 
supported by our exposure to retail and the continued recovering food service and QSR demand in particular. 
Relative to Q3 of 2019, EBIT was still higher 2% despite 8% lower volume and 5% lower revenue. 
Um, easing of, uh, COVID-19 restrictions, due to reduction of UK Government incentive directs towards food service, 
as well as a consistent improvement in food service demand within continental Europe have all contribute to a better sequentially improve performance versus the prior quarter. 
We still have not yet reached prior levels. 
Even during this challenging time. We continue to be relentless in investing in innovation. 
We're delivering labor and new improvements, driving better efficiencies, managing our cost base, and offsetting cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation and process flow 
without sacrificing the health and wellbeing of our team members which remains a priority. 
We are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible, improving the quality of our products, while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets. 
Our relative performance to the industry measure as the results of the last 12 months continues to show us improving and outpacing the average on the competition in Europe. 
For the next quarter, we expect further improvements 
coming from the food service and QSR segments as the segments adapt to the situation in each country. 
And we remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change. 
The performance of our newly acquired European pork operations have continued to improve. We did that on an upward momentum. 
We have now been profitable on an EBITDA basis for the last six quarters in a row, with margins also increasing on a consistent basis. 
The improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail, partially offset by reduction in food service 
continued strength in pork exports specially to China, as well as the implementation of operational improvements and capture of synergies. 
Exports to China remain strong and were up to 100% in Q3. 
Also, exports to China have doubled as a percentage of our total pork sales. 
And we expect demand from China to continue driving and strengthen the overall, overall exports in the near future. 
All of our E- European fresh port facilities are approved to export from China, so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities. 
We also continue to evolve in our strategy, and it will significantly increase our volumes with a new key customer in the next quarters. 
Integration of the assets is on track to expectations. 
Over the next few years, we expect to generate an EBITDA impro- improvements to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio. 
We have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired European assets through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers. 
We are optimistic about building upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint, 
extract best in class operational excellence, capitalize export opport- 
opportunities, optimize the portfolio channels, segments and products, as well as strengthening our growth business with key customers to drive innovation in value added in higher margin areas. 
We have a great team in Europe, dedicated to generating the best possible relative results by focusing on factors within our control, 
while ensuring and protecting the safety and health of our team members. 
Our prices have been rising since August, driven higher by a combination of stronger than expected export demand 
and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the US. 
USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 2.17 billion bushels, 
versus 1.99 billion last year, which includes a 550 million bushels increase in export demand. 
The current corn crop is projected at 14.7 billion bushels, the highest in four years, and over one billion bushels larger than last year. 
Although corn prices have risen from the lows we saw in August, prices are very similar to where they were this time last year. 
So, the new prices have also been rising since August, driven higher by larger than expected export demand, primarily to China. 
US is projecting the current soybean crop of 4.3 billion bushels and o- over 700 million from last year. 
Despite the large increase in production, USDA is projecting new crop ending stocks at 290 million bushels, the lowest level in four years. 
The uncertainty over the size of the Chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the United States market globally. 
With prices in Europe has also risen recently, despite the larger than expected Russian wheat crop 
and projected increase supply in other major wheat exporters like Australia. 
A slow start to the planting season in Russia and larger than expected export demand out of the US are contributing to the rise prices in the wheat market. 
On the chicken production, according to the USDA, Q3 was down half of a percent relative to Q3 2019, 
as increased lightweight did not affect headcount reductions. 
The industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock with current levels 4.40% above last year in line with the trends observed in Q1 industry. 
The industry has also managed to reduce the average age of laying hens promoting a younger, more efficient breeds. 
This has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term while enabling growth in the long term as the demand environment improves. 
Overall, the trend has shown a slowing of full replacement growth, which is in line with expectations given that most of the public placement increases in 2019 and early 202. We're expected to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period. 
From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect worker and consumer health. 
Throughout this process, consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal, and has continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment. 
This new consumer environment favors the retail channel, as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas. 
As a result, retail demand for chicken like that all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter. 
While food service demands to trail below years ago 
level, this channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segments. 
Entering Q4, the USDA expect prediction to be flat for the quarter on a year over year basis. 
Before entering 2021 in which the USDA expects oil production to grow 0.90% versus 202. 
High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food macro environment and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will affect the channels differently. 
We expect the restriction of restaurant capacities, 
social distancing guidelines consumer concern for individual health and the adaptation of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favor- favoring the increased frequency, frequency of at home meals. 
Since chicken continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins, retail demand is likely to remain above year ago levels. 
When we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels, at least in the near term, 
QSR's ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign for the chicken industry moving from late 2020 to 202. 
Our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions. 
While we are already well balanced in terms of our bird size exposure, we will remain diligent in seeking opportunities to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio 
by increasing the number of differentiated products to key customers while optimizing our existing operations, by pursuing operational improvement targets. 
Our key customer approach is strategic and creates the basis for further accelerate growth in important categories 
by promoting more customized, high quality, innovative products to give us a clear, long term sustainable competitive advantage while further improving the resilience to market situation. 
With that, let's turn to two additional details, uh, to our financials. 
Our SG&A in the third quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses, but increased support for expanding the Just BARE brand nationally, 
and the investment for our new prepared foods products both in the US and Mexico, as well as the inclusion of the new assets in Europe. 
Also included in the reported SG&A is our $50 million contribution to the Hometown Strong initiative and the DOJ agreement. 
We will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix 
that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative, less commoditized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers. 
Even during these uncertainty times. While we continue- continue to evaluate all capex projects and defer those within non essential. 
We will reiterate our commitment to investing on strong return on capital employed projects that will improve our operational efficiencies and tailor customer needs to further solidify competitive advantage for peers. 
Our balance sheets continued to be robust 
given our relentless emphasis on cash flows from operating activities, focus on management of working capital and disciplined investment in high return projects. 
Our liquidity position remains very strong in more than $1.30 billion in total cash and availability. 
We have no short term immediate cash requirements with our bonds maturing in 2025 and 2027, and our term loan maturing in 202. 
During the quarter, our net debt was 1.9 billion, the lowest since 2016, and a leverage ratio for 2.5 times less 12 months EBITDA. 
Our leverage remains at a manageable level, and we expect to continue to produce positive cash flows this year increasing our financial capability to pursue strategic actions. 
We expect 2020 interest expense of around 130 to $140 million. 
We have a strong balance sheet in a leverage that is within our targets, which are supportive for us to act on great opportunities during these uncertain times. 
We remain focused on exercise in great care ensuring that we create shareholder value by optimizing our capital structure, while preserving the flexibility to pursue a growth strategy. 
And we'll continue to consider and evaluate all relevant capital allocation strategies that will match the pursuit of our growth strategy 
and continue to review each prospect accordingly to our value creating standards. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks, please open the call for questions. Thank you. 
We will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of allowing equal access, we request that you limit your questions to two, then rejoin the queue for any follow up. 
To ask a question, you may press star and one on your touch tone phone. If you are using the speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to minimize background noise. 
To withdraw your question, please press star center. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
The first question is from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Hi, and good morning, uh, Fabio. This is Antonio Hernandez in behalf of, of Ben Theurer. 
Uh, my question is regarding COVID-19. Uh, how is your current level of absenteeism at, at glance? 
How has that evolved in recent weeks, considering the continuously high number of cases in, in the US? 
And also if you can provide a, some of, of, a kind of our own rate of, of protective measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter and, and what do you see going forward? Thanks. 
Yeah, thank you, and, uh, good morning. First, as we face this, uh, global coronavirus pandemic, we have been guided by three principles. 
First, an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members. 
Second, recognizing and embracing our responsibility to provide quality food for the country, and of course in endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time of unprecedented economic uphill. 
So, the direct costs that we are, uh, are related to the extra cleaning, and in our production in common areas. 
We also provided the PP and E, including the masks and face shields 
to all of our team members, 
and we install physical barriers in our production area. And of course, we are maintaining social distancing, whenever, wherever, uh, areas we can. 
We did more than 10,000 barriers within the first 30 days of the, the pandemic. And then we continue to upgrade those barriers. 
We also installed that dual technology UV and bipolar ionization in every plant to filter the air and neutralize potential viruses. 
As I mentioned, we are offering free LiveHealth online services for all of our, uh, team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero costs. 
And above all CDC guidelines, we removed the vulnerable team members from facilities with full pay and benefits during community outbreaks. 
And that is creating some challenges to operations because by removing those people, we have less people at our plants. 
Yeah, it, the situation is very fluid. 
It, uh, varies from plant to plant. But over the last, uh, months, we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before COVID. 
So, we are already running a much better mix that we were during, uh, the Q2, 
and we are seeing a very good increase in, uh, our absenteeism levels. 
Uh, as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we're gaining the trust of the entire communities, 
people are, uh, less, uh, uh, reluctant to return to work. 
And with that, we've been, uh, uh, improving our ability to execute the optimal mix. 
Of course, we're also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal footprint 
and with the frequent, uh, communication with the, with them. Uh, we are ensuring that our team members, uh, we expect to return to the optimal operation, uh, uh, in this quarter. 
<inaudible> on your results. The next question is from 
Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, everyone. Good morning, 
Ken. Uh, just two questions. What is, as you mix, as you change your mix, what is 
go, what was the mix between big, small and medium, say last year and then what do you think it's going to be now and then what do you think it's going to be in about a year from now, 
as you adjust your, your product mixes? 
Yeah, can we unroll balance between, uh, small birds, uh, tray-pack and large bird deboning? 
Uh, what we are doing is, uh, as the, as the demand has been shifting to more retail, 
we've been shifting, shifting our operations, also with the growth of QSR, 
we've also adapted those conditions. What we are doing for 2021 
is to first, uh, move that plant from big bird deboning to small bird deboning which will increase, uh, our, our presence in that segment. 
We are also doubling the capacity in our Minnesota plant, 
uh, to, um, comply and comply or support the growth of our key customers and adjust their brand, which has doubled the sales in the online channel over, uh, this quarter. 
Looking into overall portfolio, we move from 46% of our total sales in retail to around 51%, 
just in 2020 with small changes in our operation. 
For next year, expect, uh, 
2% increase in that, uh, portfolio to the retail and, uh, one to 2% increase in the small bird with those, uh, two conversions. 
Great. My, my next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the Mexican margins? I, I, you know, particularly, I, 
I did see that there was a, uh, a little bit of a FX benefit. 
How do you think about the Mexican operation? I think you did say that it's going to, it's still continuing the momentum into the fourth quarter, 
then how do you think about it for 2000, uh, uh, 21? How, how do we frame it in our minds? 
Yeah, sure, Ken. 
And, we've been talking about Mexico, uh, over the last few years that they are very volatile quarter over quarter, but they are more stable if you think a longer period of time or within a year. 
What happened in the first quarter or in the first semester in Mexico was a complete imbalance during supply and demand. 
So, the industry increased supply during the first semester, 
and at the same time demand because of the COVID-19, uh, really, uh, create a, a challenging environment. 
As you remember, in Mexico, there was no, 
um, support from the government with the COVID-19 like we have in US. In Europe, there 
is no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits, 
which created a sharp, uh, slowdown and recession in the region, 
which really affected the, the, the demand both in the food service and retail. 
While within US, we saw, um, an increase in retail compensating at least partially the shutdown in food service that didn't happen in, in Mexico. 
And that's why the supply and demand was completely out of balance. 
As the industry adapted their supply, 
uh, for the Q3 and we, uh, at Pilgrim's, uh, adapted to that situation as well, 
we reduce our costs, and we also cut production. 
The supply and demand improves a lot. And we saw the rebound in the food service and demand in Q3. 
And now we have very, uh, stable prices, uh, during this time in Mexico. 
We expect this to continue during, uh, Q4. 
Q4 has always been a stronger quarter for Mexico with the festivities. We don't know at which, uh, point that will be, uh, uh, reduced because of the, 
the COVID restrictions. 
We've seen some increase in cases in Mexico. 
Uh, so there could be some more restrictions in, in the Q4 but given the supply and demand situation that we are right now, the results are, are sustainable. 
Now, for Q1, we expect, uh, the industry to increase production to, uh, equate, uh, supply and demand 
and the return to more normal levels. 
Mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again, but we expect, uh, to be very stable, uh, year over year. 
Of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiated products as well. 
We saw a little bit of, uh, impact in the prepared foods, uh, especially on the more affordable products during Q1. 
But we continue to invest and, uh, highly differentiated the Pilgrim's products continue to sell really well. 
Longer term, despite the volatility, Mexico is a growing economy. And as the population increase their disposable income, it leads to a significant growth in protein consumption. Great. 
I really appreciate the answer. Thank you, Ken. 
The next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. 
Hey, good morning. 
Hi, Ben. I want to ask, um, you, you touched on in your opening comments with ASF in China and, and Germany. I want to ask on Germany more specifically. I would think that's a nice boon for the tool of business. Just curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market, and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well, 
uh, and how you think you're positioned to capture that benefit? 
Yeah, thank you, Ben. And the operations in Europe are more focused on the retail. 
So, we produce, uh, most of our products in UK for the retail UK market. And because of the high welfare, we command a premium in that region. 
The big competition, uh, as you, as you refer, 
is on the food service, uh, sector have imported products from Poland and Germany, mainly and Spain, on the port side. 
Um, as the Germans, uh, have this issues with, uh, their production, and because of the ban in China, 
it actually increases the sales, uh, in the UK market. 
It also creates the opportunity for our UK products to be sold into China. 
So, what we saw is that on the, uh, what we call fifth quarter products, 
a, a significant increase in pricing. But on the normal products like loins and, and others, 
we see the prices more stable because it's a, a, a zero sum game at the end of the day. 
So, uh, it increases the opportunity to China. So, that was, uh, uh, welcome. 
I think our sales, uh, like we mentioned have doubled during Q3 and we're seeing some, some very stable pricing. 
But it also includes the competition in the food service segments in, uh, UK. 
Okay, great. Uh, my second question is related to grain. And apologies if I missed this in your opening comment. I did hear your overview of the market. 
Could you talk about how you're positioned relative to the markets? You know, are you more hand to mouth at the moment? Do you have any basis secured? 
Any color you could offer there on how your positioned, um, you know through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful? Hey, Ben. This is Joe. 
Thank you for the question. O- obviously we've seen prices of corn and soybean now increase in the last few months. 
It's been, it's been the result of a few factors. For corn, we've seen a reduction from the supply side with USDA reporting 6 million fewer planted acres than they originally estimated back in March. 
We also saw our final stocks for 2019 end up being 200 million bushels less than was expected when the final accounting was done. 
On the current crop, we actually, for the acres that are planted, see pretty good yields, of uptrend on yields, so it's not an issue on the supply side in terms of US production. 
But on the demand side, we've also seen much bigger export, uh, demand primarily driven by China. 
Still the USDA is projecting a carrier out, carryout of around 2.1 billion bushels and that includes a 30% increase in export demand from last year. 
So, even if export demand ends up higher than what the USDA is projecting, corn stock should still be in line with previous years. 
On soybeans, USDA is projecting a 290 million bushel carryout, which would be the lowest carryout in five years. 
This projection though includes a 31% increase in export demand driven by China. 
In addition to increase exports in Argentina, which is one of the world's largest sold seed exporting countries is in the midst of a historic economic crisis, which is causing farmers near to hold back available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the US to meet this demand. 
We believe the market is likely to feel anxious about US soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in Argentina 
or in South, South American supplies can be available to meet this demand. 
In terms of our position, we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risk we see. And we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy. 
We do recognize the risks of soybean supplies in the US and our positions reflect that. 
Okay, awesome. Thanks. And that's all. Thank you, again. As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star, then one. 
The next question is from Michael Pekin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. 
Yeah, hi. Good morning. I just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of, uh, you know, the move, I guess, uh, you know, into retail, and, you know, uh, some of that big bird product, is that, uh, being chopped up and put into trays 
and, you know, how is that impacting, 
you know, some of the margins on the commodity business? 
Yes, Mike, um, there's a lot of products on the big birds, uh, especially during, uh, promotional season, seasonality during the summer, that from the big birds end up being put in the tray to be sold in the retailers. 
We continue to do that. 
I think the, the challenge to the industry is that, uh, we need to have a label available and the facilities available to do more of that 
and that's why the industry has not increased, uh, more, uh, production to the tray pack as we, uh, as, as we want 
or as the demand continues to grow. 
It's also because of that we are increasing the capacity in our Minnesota plant. 
So, as of today, yes, we are buying big bird meat, and we continue to put it on, on a tray, especially during Saturdays. And I, I think the whole industry is doing that. 
Okay, great. And then my second question is, you know, just looking at the, uh, you, you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down, and you're starting to get back to your normal mix, 
um, in terms of some of deboned, dark meat, 
do you, are you starting to, uh, return that, 
uh, you know, historical levels? And what could that mean, uh, for the leg quarter prices, 
which is seeing, you know, the most pressure cannot help, or is it, you know, the fact that China is taking more pork? Can that help with leg quarters that are, 
do I have a leg quarter prices moved, if there's more deboned, uh, 
dark meat potentially being produced? And, you know, it seems like, you know, the, at the very least trying to take in more US pork? 
Yes, you're right, Mike. Um, because of the absenteeism and also the food service industry in US, uh, 
the industry produce 3% more leg quarters, uh, in July and August than the same period, uh, last year, 
despite a lower total production. That put a lot of pressure in the leg quarter pricing. 
Um, and as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service, 
and as we are seeing the absenteeism and the staffing of our clients increasing, uh, for us and for the whole industry, we are seeing more, uh, deboning. 
We are, uh, already at levels comparable to last year in terms of deboning which will reduce the pressure in the leg quarters. 
Of course, uh, China has been also more active in the leg quarter market over the, the last month. 
And we are seeing that in the leg quarter inventory. 
That was up on a, on a sequential basis up to August, but we are seeing a reduction. 
And also the inventories, uh, today is down 9% compared to the peak Q1 average that we have. 
So, those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the leg quarter production, which is a commodity, uh, item, as, as I mentioned. 
And the China interest, 
I think we saw over the last, uh, uh, weeks, although not today, the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in, in the, in the dollar, which increase the, 
uh, availability of dollars from the, uh, uh, developing countries, which also increases the demand for leg quarters. 
So, what could help on the leg quarters, uh, going forward? It's both on supply and demand and supply is exactly what you said, 
the last leg quarters because of the improvement in, uh, labor 
efficiencies, and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on demand, because of low prices, and because of, uh, more stable income in the, in the developing economies. 
The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Hey, guys, good morning. Uh, thanks for taking the question. Um, you know, 
Fabio, just as, as I'm thinking about it, you know, the, the, the small bird and retail channels obviously have been tremendously profitable, um, for, for you guys during, you know, this time period. 
Um, with, and, and you know, with the plant conversion coming, but, you, you know, with, with commodity big bird remaining, you know, in a cut off, you have your remaining under such pressure, 
just at, at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant, 
um, whether that's to retail or, or to small bird because it just, it just seems like that big bird portion is, is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or, or taken out of the market, you know, in, in, in some capacity. Sure, thank you, Peter. 
I think the decision to convert the plant is a more long term decision. 
And we always make those decisions, uh, combined with our key customer strategy. 
As we see the demand of this key customers growing, uh, we take action in our portfolio. 
So, and, and that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that, uh, from that operation, from big bird to small bird to support, uh, this growth. 
I think, a- again, you need to look into a more broader, long term perspective. We continue to expect the food service sector to rebound. 
If you look at the food service sector, 
today, the full service restaurants are now 13% year over year, and that is impacting the big bird deboning for sure 
while the QSR is around 9%. 
As we go through a more normal, uh, operations as we see, 
uh, maybe the development of vaccines, we don't know when that's going to happen or we see more openings of the restaurants, 
we expect the food service, uh, restaurants, especially on the food service, to regain, uh, some market share that they are not, uh, uh, operating today. 
So, I, I think it's a long term decision. 
And it's also a very, uh, difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have 
the growers, and we have the feed mills, it's all built to that specific bird. 
Our, our plants in the United States are really customized to that specific segment. So, any conversion, 
it really requires significant capital and requires some significant, significant, uh, changes in the, uh, overall supply chain, 
both starting from the growers, your feed mills, 
and your field operations. 
So, it's a, it's a high capital investment, that it needs to be supported in for the long run. 
So, that's why we don't see a lot of conversions, uh, in our industry. 
Of course, if this, um, situation continued for, for a longer period of time, you can see some conversions. 
I think also, it's important, uh, to know that some other players don't have the key customer relationships that we have and moving from the big bird to the small bird or to the case-ready require a customer 
and, um, a key customer to support. 
And since they don't have those relationships, it's harder for them to do some, um, 
conversions. All right, now, that- that's, that's helpful. Um, and, and then maybe just to follow up, you know, given where the balance sheet is now, some- something you talked about your prepared remarks, 
um, you know, how should we think about M&A potential, maybe from a geographic perspective, um, or does it make sense to get bigger in, in pork and in Europe, and you know, going into 2021? 
Uh, just, just any help there. And then, and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your, uh, CFO search. Thanks very much. Sure. 
In terms of strategy, I think our strategy continues to same, 
and our growth strategy continues. In fact, as, as I mentioned, have a very strong balance sheet. We look into increasing our prepared foods operation and our branded operation 
to, uh, to create a more balanced portfolio. 
And we are also looking for chicken assets, where we can extract, uh, more value from operational efficiencies. 
Uh, we're seeing targets, uh, both in the US and outside US geographical diversification and to growth in Europe. 
And we will evaluate all alternatives, uh, to our value creation standards. 
In terms of, uh, the CFO, we are, um, in, in the process of, 
uh, of finding another C- CFO, we already engage, uh, uh, recruiting firms, 
and we should have, uh, some, some news in the near future. 
Great. Thanks very much, guys. mm-hmm <affirmative>. The next question is from 
Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs & Co. Please go ahead. 
Uh, yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
Good morning, Adam. All right, so, so maybe first, just a clarification and a little more detail, um, the 
expansion of the Minnesota plants for, for case-ready, and, and the conversion of the Texas plants small bird from big bird, 
um, what's the net impact on your production volume, um, and what's the capital costs of those, uh, projects? 
Yeah, in terms of total volume, I think we should be just a little bit up. 
We expect to be, to grow in line with the USDA expectations and the industry for 2021, which is a little bit lower than 1%. 
Yes, as we h- have more birds in Minnesota, 
but we've also reduced the weights in our operation, uh, on the big bird that we are transforming to a small bird. 
So, we expect to be for 2021 in line with, with those two. 
In terms of investments, it's not a very significant to our total capex, 
um, as the conversion of the small bird plant, 
it's, it's not a, it's, it's a simple conversion. 
Uh, of course, that QSR requires, um, some DSI, which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment. 
And we're going to invest in automation in that plant as well. Today, there's a manual deboning operation, and we're going to invest in the 
automate- auto- automated deboning, so the investment is close to 20 to $25 million in that operation. 
And in the, 
um, in the case of the case-ready operation is close to $70 million. So, overall, it is a total of $100 million, that we got to invest in those two conversions. 
Okay, that's, uh, that's helpful. And the, the, the follow up was, um, I just want to make sure I heard something right in the prepared remarks. Uh, you talked about the prepared food business 
in the US, declining, uh, 26% I think is what I heard, 
um, and maybe hoping to just, could you expand on that? That's a business that I think had more challenges over the years 
and just, is, do we, is it really just a question of return to school and, and food service traffic? Or how do we think about that business or margin profile moving forward? 
Yeah, uh, that's exactly it. 
We, in our prepared food business, we have a strong brand, which is the Pierce brand that is mainly a food service, uh, brand. 
We also are very strong in the school with our Gold, Gold Kist, uh, brand. 
Both those segments are the ones that are most, most affected by the, the COVID-19. 
The non commercial food service that includes schools are now 66% at, uh, Q2, and now they are down 43%. 
We're seeing some school reopens which could help. But it's the segment that is still down 40%. 
On what we call the commercial food service, which is a street business where our Pierce brand is a, is a leading brand in wings and in chunks, 
we saw that in Q2, they, uh, end up 36% lower than the prior year, 
but they're rebounding. And then today, they are close to 4% lower than the same period last, last year. 
So, the food service business has been recovering. And with that, our Pierce, uh, brand has, 
uh, recovered in our volumes, 
but, uh, school system is still, uh, close to 20% lower than the prior year. 
And that's why we are investing in more retail branded business. 
As we mentioned, our, um, Pilgrim's brand has increased more than 30%. 
And we have been very successful in spending the Just BARE brand from the fresh category, which has been very successful on, on the online segment and also on the, 
on the higher attributes segment in our, uh, key customers to the prepared food segment. 
Uh, all right, great. That's uh, that's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you, Adam. 
The next question comes from Carla Casella with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hi, my question is regarding your leverage, 
um, the three times target, how comfortable or, or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional M&A? And are you seeing any, 
um, more M&A opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein market? 
Yeah, thank you, Carla. We, we set these targets of two to three times because it's the, it's the best capital structure 
that can protect and reduce our, uh, uh, 
interest, uh, payments, while not creating any, any, any problem for our, for our bonds and for our, our leverage. 
Um, the two to three times is in normal operations. Of course, during some acquisitions, 
if we have a, a great plan on how to reduce that back, we can go further. 
I don't think there is a number that, uh, it's specific, uh, on, on where we go. I think it's more about what is the plan to deleverage. 
And of course, the plan to deleverage could include, 
uh, the issue of stock. And that's why Pilgrim's as a public traded company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency, 
not to increase the leverage, uh, to points, uh, where we don't think it is prudent in the case of a significant acquisition that will be transformational for the company. 

In terms of- Okay, and just one last one. Now, in terms… S- sorry, in terms of M&A, yes, we are seeing more targets. Of course, the, the whole situation about traveling has, 
uh, uh, created some challenges in terms of, uh, seeing and visiting assets. 
But, uh, we are seeing, uh, some targets that are still, uh, very, uh, interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders. 
Okay. Great. And then just in the event that JBS is able to list the US business, would that cause any need for a change in your structure? 
Yeah, we don't believe so. I think JBS has, uh, said many times that they, they continue to support, um, Pilgrim's to be a public traded company. And, and just as I mentioned, 
it is a great way for us to, uh, keep our growth. 
We can use, uh, the equity as a currency in the case of a very important, uh, and transformational event for Pilgrim's. 
Okay, thank you. 
Once again, if you have a question, please press star and one on your phone.
