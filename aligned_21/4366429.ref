Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona Earnings Conference Call. 
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. 
To ask a question during that session, you will need to press star one on your telephone and please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. 
If you require any further assistance, just press star and zero. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, John Sweeney. <silence>. 
Thank you operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. 
I'd like to remind you that an earnings call press release and slide presentation related to the call 
are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. 
Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our Earnings Press Release. 
During today's call, we make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. 
We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. 
Our most recent Form 10-K list some of those most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from predictions. 
And with that, I'd now like to turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, Dentsply Sirona. 
Thank you, John. And thank all of you for joining us today. We hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. 
To start the call, I would like to acknowledge two groups that deserve both our gratitude and recognition. 
The first is our customers. 
Throughout this pandemic, dentists and their staff have shown tremendous resilience, 
whether dealing with changing local regulations, adjusting to new safety protocols, or finding new ways to help patients. 
Dentists, all over the world, have adopted and innovated. 
Their commitment to their patients is inspiring. 
The second group is the employees of Dentsply Sirona. Over the last six months, they have been challenged in truly unprecedented ways. 
Throughout, they've remained focused on serving our customers, creatively addressing new circumstances and continuing to make progress on our critical initiatives. 
This highlights that the people of Dentsply Sirona and the culture we are building are truly our most important assets. 
I would like to thank all of them around the world for their extraordinary efforts. It is a privilege to lead such a committed and passionate group. 
Our call today will focus on four key areas: the first is to outline our second quarter results; 
the second is to provide some details on how our business has been performing as dentists' offices reopen; 
the third area provides the steps that Dentsply Sirona is taking to position the company for the future; 
and finally, I will review the company's near-term priorities as we navigate the current environment. 
As expected, our second quarter results reflect the major changes in the market. 
The quarter began with significant governmental actions, resulting in the shutdown of dental practices and restrictions on patient traffic. 
The situation improved across the quarter, with month to month improvements in terms of dentists' offices opening and patients beginning to come back. 
Our revenue followed this trend. 
Our team continued to track patient attitudes around returning to the dental office, as well as the ongoing impact of additional infection control requirements on office capacity. 
Based on what we are seeing, we are optimistic that the recovery is well underway globally. 
Our results in the quarter also reflect significant actions the company took to address the difficult operating environment. 
These plans were built around employees' safety, meeting the needs of the customer, enhancing the financial strength of the company, 
and making continued progress on our key strategic initiatives. 
Today, we've seen good results around employee safety and have not seen any major disruptions across the organization. 
Despite challenges presented by the pandemic, the company has been able to reliably meet customer demand. 
Our commercial team showed excellent creativity in adapting to the new circumstances, providing an extensive array of digital clinical education and online marketing events. 
These programs have been extremely well-received. 
A comprehensive cost-control program was executed during the second quarter involving furloughs, short work weeks, salary reductions and spending controls. 
These efforts contributed to the drop in SG&A expenses in the quarter. 
While the business has begun to restart… This program will remain in place until the trajectory of the recovery is better understood. 
Our supply chain has been disciplined around inventory and there has been a real emphasis on protecting our cash flow. 
Finally, the company undertook a series of actions to bolster its liquidity and financial position. 
While there is a pressing need to manage the disruptions caused by the pandemic, our team is focused on positioning the company for the future. 
Since announcing a restructuring in late 2018, Dentsply Sirona has made significant progress against the goals we had laid out. 
Our work on continuously challenging ourselves has shown there are still further opportunities to improve our performance. 
Therefore, today, we are announcing additional portfolio actions that expand on the original program. 
These include plans for exiting the traditional orthodontics business, as well as parts of our analog lab business. 
I will discuss details later in the call. 
These steps, while difficult, allow the company to focus on higher growth and higher margin digital areas, where we believe Dentsply Sirona has strategic advantage. 
Moving to slide seven, where we summarize our Q2 20 results. 
Second quarter revenues were $491 million down 50% on an organic basis due to the impact of the coronavirus. 
Adjusted operating income was negative… Non- GAAP EPS for the quarter was a loss of 18 cents. 
Cash flow is actively managed in the second quarter, driving cash flow from operations of $175 million, which was up 21% compared to prior year. 
I will now turn the call over to Jorge, who will review the quarterly results and provide an outlook. 
Thank you Don, and good morning everyone. The second quarter was obviously a challenging one for the global economy and for many industries, including dental. 
On slide nine, we show our second quarter, Non- GAAP 2020 P&L. 
Starting with the top line, organic sales were down to 50% as compared to the prior year. 
In the US and Europe, with some minor exceptions, dental practices limited their activity to emergency procedures in April 
and much of May and then began to reopen as we moved into June. 
As we share on our last earnings call, we saw declines of 60% to 80% in April in certain geographies, with the US being hit the hardest. 
But our revenue trend improved gradually each month, finishing down about 40% compared to prior year in June. 
We also saw a gradual improvement from the first to the last week in June. 
So it is clear that we are seeing a recovery but have yet to get back to a normal level of sales. 
Gross profit was 207 million or 42.10% of sales, down from 57.70% in the prior year quarter. 
As it is the case in <inaudible> and material reductions in volume, 
gross profit margin is impacted by the fixed cost base, which is difficult to address in the short term. 
Examples of this cost include depreciation, leases, maintenance of manufacture in logistic facilities and cost related to ensuring compliance with high manufacturing standards. 
Gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately 17 million, 
primarily as a result of lower sales. 
SG&A of 249 million was down a substantial 132 million, which is approximately 35% lower as compared to prior year. 
During the quarter, we took decisive action to reduce our SG&A cost, resulting in the steep year over year decline. 
One area in SG&A that actually increased over last year was bad debt expense, which saw an uptake of 15 million year over year. 
These significant P&L fluctuations were driven by the ongoing market disruptions and generated an operating loss of 42 million in the quarter. 
Last year, our operating profit was 202 million in the second quarter. 
Interest and other increased by 9.9 million versus last year, driven by the issuance of 750 million in long term debt, the addition of new credit facilities and determination of certain FX hedges. 
In Non- GAAP tax rate was 27.50% in the quarter, up from 25.30% in the prior year. 
A function of the change in the estimated amount of pretax income and a change to the expected income mix. 
Non- GAAP EPS was a loss of 18 cents as compared to Non- GAAP EPS of 66 cents in the prior year quarter. 
Moving onto slide 10, where we review our consumable segment performance. 
Reported sales were $187 million, down 58.60% 
and down 57.70% on our organic sales basis. 
All of our product groups in consumables were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices. 
While our consumable sales show a steeper decline than our T&E sales, both segments actually performed roughly similar from an end customer perspective. 
Let me explain the two factors that contributed to la- to i- to the larger decline in our consumable sales. 
First, there's a difference in order lead times. 
Consumable deliveries tend to match demand almost simultaneously, up or down. 
Due to the nature of the products, T&E has a longer order lead time and therefore, deliveries continued over an extended period, 
even after dental procedure volume is slowed down at the beginning of the quarter. 
The second factor impacted consumables more than T&E, is the fluctuations in inventory levels in the dealer network. 
During severe market conditions, it is typical for companies to preserve cash by lowering inventory balances as much as possible. 
We saw a steeper decline in consumables network inventory. 
So when you account for all of these variables, we believe both segments decline at roughly similar levels. 
Consumables operating margin was -9.40% as compared to 27% in the second quarter of 201. 
There are two primary reasons for the decline in consumables margins. 
The first reason is that the consumables segment experienced a steeper fall-off in sales compared to T&E. 
Second, the consumables business is more plant and infrastructure dependent and requires more volume to run efficiently. 
We have more manufacturing plant dedicated to consumables and this means a higher fixed infrastructure cost for this segment. 
This is why we have been taking steps to consolidate our footprint and reduce our fixed cost base. 
In the past couple of years, we have completed several portfolio shaping actions, 
including FONA, 1-800 Dentist, SICAT and the surgical business of Wellspect. 
In addition, 
the two portfolio shaping activities we are announcing today will further consolidate our manufacturing footprint and will increase productivity and decrease fixed costs. 
Moving onto slide 11 where we highlight our technologies and equipment segment. 
Net sales were 304 million, down 45.60% as compared to prior year. 
Organic sales for the quarter, were down 43.60% versus the prior year. 
Equipment and instruments, digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter, driven by the lower sales resulting from COVID-19. 
Our healthcare business saw a slight decline in Q2 after posting a strong Q1 as healthcare systems were getting ready for their first major waves of COVID-19. 
Technologies and equipment operating income was -1.30% versus 17.20% in the prior year quarter. 
On slide 12, we show our business performance for the second quarter on a regional basis. 
US sales of 131 million declined 60.30% compared to the prior year. 
This represents a decline in organic sales of 60%. 
In the US market, consumables decline slightly more than T&E. 
European sales were $215 million, down 49% compared to the prior year. 
Organic sales were down 46.90% versus last year. 
In Europe, consumable sales declined more than technologies and equipment on a percentage basis. 
Rest of the world sales were 144 million, down 44%. And organic sales were down 41.9%. 
Rest of the world consumables declined more than T&E sales in the senc- in the second quarter. 
On slide 13, we show our cash flow performance. 
In the second quarter of 2020, cash flow from operations was 175 million as compared to 145 million in the prior year quarter. 
This strong cash flow generation was the result of a disciplined approach to curtailing expenses, and reducing working capital without sacrificing key, uh, strategic investments. 
Working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity in the quarter. 
We were successful in achieving meaningful reductions in accounts, receivables and inventory balances. 
We expect some of this cash will be injected back into working capital as demand and production volumes climb back up to normal levels. 
In terms of capital expenditures, we spent 13 million in the second quarter of 2020, down from 27 million last year. 
Free cash flow was a strong 162 million in the quarter, up 37% as compared to 118 million in the prior year. 
In the quarter, we paid 22 million in dividends where a total of 184 million returned to shareholders, 
through dividends and share purchases in the first six months of 202. 
At the end of June 2020, we had a strong liquidity available comprising 1.1 billion of cash and 1.2 billion of committed credit facilities. 
The efforts we made during the second quarter ensured that we have ample liquidity available to invest and grow the company as the economy recovers. 
On slide 14, I'd like to talk about the significant actions we took to reduce operating expenses in the second quarter of 202. 
Our efforts to reduce costs in the quarter were multifaceted. All levels and functions of the enterprise contributed to significant compensation savings. 
Each part of the organization, up to and including the board of directors at executive levels, they stepped up and helped in these efforts. 
As of today, most of our employees, who were impacted by these measures, have returned to work or to normal pay levels. 
The next largest area for cost reductions was discretionary commercial spend, such as advertising and promotions. 
It was logical to reduce this spend when dental offices were closed and the returns could not be realized. 
We also achieved significant savings from reductions in professional services and of course, travel expenses. 
Together, all of these actions deliver a reduction in SG&A of 35% versus last year. 
With respect to business trends for the remainder of the year, I'd like to make a few comments. 
First, let me start with current volume trends. 
All regions recovered from their low point in April and improved by 20 to 40 percentage points by the end of the quarter. 
Additionally, in June, the last week of the month was significantly better than the first week, 
and we are pleased to note that the positive momentum continues into July, 
with July sales approaching or surpassing 2019 levels, depending on the region and product groups. 
There are still some gating factors in place, including the availability of personal protection equipment, 
new infection prevention protocols, reducing office capacity 
and overlapping regulations, all of which, impact the shape of the recovery. 
Together, these factors point to a gradual as opposed to a sudden, is now back in demand. 
Let me give you more details, from a geographical perspective. 
In the US, virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to see signs of improvement, with July volumes trending better than what we saw in June. 
In Europe, we also saw July trends improving sequentially. 
With regards to the rest of the world, in APAC, some of the markets turned positive in July, with good traction in China and Japan 
and some lingering concerns in Australia. 
Latin America remains a challenging market as COVID-19 continues to impact our business in Brazil and other countries in the region. 
Moving forward to the second half of the year. As we announced today, we are accelerating actions to fund growth areas and improve efficiencies. 
As we did in Q2, we will continue to drive a disciplined resource allocation process 
that emphasizes return investment and sustainability of our growth initiatives. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don. 
Thanks Jorge. And moving to slide 1. 
As I mentioned earlier in the call in November 2018, we put a plan in place to accelerate growth, improve margins and simplify the organization. 
Our results, through 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, show significant progress. 
The execution highlights of our plan include: accelerating growth behind new products including Primescan and Primemill, as well as other new products in our consumable portfolio. 
The pipeline of future new products has also been enhanced. 
The company has made major investments in critical areas, like our digital product portfolios, 
digital commercial capabilities and growth priorities like our SureSmile, clear aligner business. 
Dentsply Sirona has implemented a new organizational structure, centralizing supply chain and other functions while creating a unified commercial structure. 
There have been major initiatives designed to transform the finance, HR and IT areas. 
Further, we have undertaken multiple portfolio shaping activities, including the ones announced today. 
The restructuring plan is a multi-year initiative. 
As part of that, the organization has embraced the need to continue challenging ourselves to go beyond the original plan and deliver better results. 
That work has shown there are significant opportunities in both the near term and longer term. 
Moving now to slide 1. Over the last several quarters, as Jorge mentioned, we have exited several under-performing businesses. 
These reduce our cost and complexity while serving to enhance our growth and margins. 
The team continually reviews all our businesses against a framework around future growth opportunities, as well as strategic fit. 
In the area of orthodontics, we believe that the clear aligner space is an attractive opportunity for Dentsply Sirona. 
SureSmile now offers a comprehensive digital treatment plan that positions the company well in this rapidly growing market. 
Going forward, we will focus all our efforts in the ortho space on the clear aligner area. 
We believe this offers the opportunity to grow, innovate and take advantage of many Dentsply Sirona's unique strategic advantages, 
including a large Syracuse community. 
As a result, we are exiting the traditional orthodontic business which includes brackets, bands, tubes and wires. 
The traditional orthodontic business is component of the technology and equipment segment and has had net sales of approximately 132 million in 201. 
Likewise, in our lab business there is a clear opportunity to focus on the digital space which is showing good growth rates and solid margins. It is a place where innovation will be rewarded. 
Based on our analysis, it is critical to focus all our lab resources in the digital area going forward. 
As such, we are announcing plans to exit the analog portion of the laboratory business that manufacture removable dentures and related products. 
This business is a component of the consumable segment and had net sales of approximately 44 million in 201. 
Together, the portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities 
and the incremental reduction of approximately 6% to 7% of the company's workforce by the end of 202. 
The ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance Dentsply Sirona's continued efforts to grow revenues, expand our margins and simplify the organization. 
Slide 19 lists our priorities for the back half of 202. 
They include executing on our comprehensive restructuring plan, pursuing our growth initiatives aggressively and meeting our financial objectives. 
In conclusion, the COVID pandemic will continue to impact our industry and our company for the foreseeable future. 
Current trends are positive and a reason for optimism but we will need to continue to adapt to the circumstances as they change. 
We believe we have a comprehensive plan for both the short term and longer term to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. 
Further, the company has maintained its focus on our priorities around growth, margin expansion and simplifying the business. 
Our financial strength, broad portfolio and global reach are… position us well to succeed and win in the dental industry. 
It's hard to know what the new normal is or when it will arrive, but our internal theme is that teeth do not heal themselves. 
Our team is optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and we embrace the current challenges and are confident in our strategy, our customers and our team. 
Thank you. And with that, we'll take questions. 
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, just press star, then one to get in the queue. To withdraw your question, simply press the pound or hash key. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
Our first question is from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay? I think I was on mute there. Yeah. 
We can- we- we got you, Jeff. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Good morning. So, uh, Don, uh, I- 
I think I just wanna start with the July comments and I really wanna understand maybe the message that you want to have out there. 
Uh, it sounds like you make the argument that July was getting back towards flat-ish year over year levels, uh, according to what Jorge said. 
But how much of that might be sell-in that was recovering off, uh, some sell-in issues earlier in the quarter, or earlier in 2Q. 
Uh, does your sell-in… is it starting to match, kind of, the sell-out at this point? 
And again, I know you're not guiding but for 3Qs, we think the line maybe isn't sustainable 
as you get into August and September, i- if there is some backlog it <inaudible> helping in that July number. Thanks. 
Yeah. Thanks Jeff. Um, you- you know, look, uh, I think Jorge said it clearly in the, uh, prepared remarks as we were- as- as we were looking at July. There's places that have, 
uh, you know, we're seeing good progress. In- in some cases, it's actually exceeding ' 1. Your specific question about how much of that is, you know, 
inventory, rebuild, um, y- you know, it's hard to see exactly. There's a couple things we're looking at 
and, um, you know, uh, that's- that's one of the reasons we're not being, uh, okay let's just go project July into August, September and the… and later in the fourth quarter. 
The things we're looking at is patient volume, 
and we've seen that as good office capacity. 
Uh, we see office capacity kind of improving. Our- our patient tracking is telling us that, 
uh, you know confidence in the dentist office continues to go up, but there is a pocket 
that's gonna be reluctant, at least in the US, to go back for a little while. 
A- and what that, in- in our mind, means that okay, uh, look, if- if we're getting capacity in the- in the dentist office back 
to, you know, close to normal, that's gonna take a little bit of time. I- 
I think we're working to <inaudible> of patients right now. 
Uh, and then I- I think, y- you know, from an inventory perspective, our dealers' and the dentist office, ultimately, are working through the fact that, uh, y- you know, when- when the pandemic started, 
I think people hit the brakes pretty hard on stuff that's ordered almost every day. And- and in our minds, that's kinda the consumable space. 
And you could see, Jeff, the difference between our consumable and technol-… you know, the- the T&E side. 
Uh, a- and we believe that is a lot to do with okay, uh, we don't know how long the office is gonna be closed. 
Uh, you know, we- we're gonna stop, uh, building inventory on the daily stuff, 
and as a result, there may be some bill back here. 
Um, but look, I- I… In my summary, I was pretty clear on saying, hey look, 
we- we're happy that we saw, you know, consecutive month to month sequential improvement 
in overall demand. We're seeing that at the retail level. 
We're happy that July has continued that trend and we're happy to see that and you know, some cases, it… you know we're actually tracking better than 201. 
Understood. That's helpful. Thanks Don. And just as a follow-up, you know, thinking about 2021 conceptually, 
uh, you know, we all know what the ADA is saying about, uh, high likelihood that, uh, dental consumption and- and dental industry ri- revenues are down, relative to 2019 
level. Uh, 
I don't think anybody would really argue with that, at least looking at things right now. 
Uh but with some of the extra restructuring efforts you're taking now, some of the tailwinds from the restructuring, uh, that we're probably still continuing from the past plan, 
you know, how do- how do you think about the margins, e- especially next year? Can they get back to 2019 levels with revenue that at least, it is approaching 2019 
levels next year? 
Or- or is there a lag in, kind of, the margin recovery relative to how we think about, uh, revenues next year? Thanks. 
Yeah, Jeff. It's- it's early for us to- to really forecast 202. Uh, I- 
I would tell you the steps we took around the restructuring though reflect our interest in sitting there saying hey, look, 
d- uh, we- we need to get back on the margin progression. 
I mean, you know, we've- we've been saying since November 2018, how do we grow, how do we get our margins improving and I think w- I think we have to take s- uh, organizational steps to do it. 
I think the results, uh, here show you that, you know, we- we think we've made some good progress. I mean, you know, basically through the first quarter of 2020, we were tracking on a margin basis. 
And, uh, you know, what we've seen, uh, obviously our margin is revenue dependent 
and, uh, you- you know, I… Hey, look, if- if revenue's down 20% in, uh, 2021, that's obviously gonna have an impact on the business. We don't think that's gonna happen, but 
we're taking specific steps now to sit there and say 
regardless of- of, you know, whether the category is up two or three or down two or three, or, you know, up 10, down 10, 
we wanna be taking steps toward margin accretion. 
And, you know, as we get out of the traditional ortho business, we get out… we got out of the analog lab business, those are all part of the ongoing restructuring designed to help us, uh, really take charge of our ability to drive margin accretion going forward, 
uh, a- and- and I'm not gonna say it's gonna be revenue independent, but we think we can take steps, you know, at a- at a certain revenue base, that we're really gonna be able to drive margin. 
And, you know, 
we- we were very clear, uh, uh, you know, I- I joke with John Sweeney occasionally that, uh, we- we picked our revenue targets to match the years just to make sure that we could always communicate it. 
So we've always said ' 22… in 2022, y- you know, uh, and internally, what we're trying to focus on is look, we- we think ' 22 is- is a- is attainable. 
We don't know if it's gonna happen exactly on the trajectory, based on what 
we're seeing with, uh, COVID. You know, it- it's COVID and the, uh, knock-on effects of that. 
Is that a six-month issue? It's a nine months, it's, uh, 
12-month issue but we wanna be marching back toward that target. Uh, it just may take us a little bit longer to get there. 
Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hey, um, are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter was inventory destocking, versus slower orders and- and how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors, uh, around potential additional destocking? 
Uh, good morning Tycho. Uh, this is Jorge. 
It is, uh, you know, it- it's hard to, um, give a- any precise number, but as- as Don just indicated, 
uh, in the case of consumables, uh, there is a, 
uh… The- the order lead time is very short 
and so, uh, when the pandemic hit, 
uh, customers and- and dealers and in general, in the- in the market place, there was a- 
a reaction to, uh, to manage inventories very, very closely. 
And, uh, when we look at the data of, uh, retail sales and our sales, 
uh, there- there are a lot of indications that show that, uh, there was a- a reduction in the inventory levels that, uh, we, historically, or typically, uh, uh, carry in- in the network. 
So, uh, there was an element of that and, um, when that comes back to, uh, to typical levels, is- is hard to, uh, to project. 
Uh, some of that may be happening as, uh, as- as Don indicated. 
Uh, but I don't think that is, uh, something that, uh, for us, um, is going to be, uh, meaningful from a long term perspective. 
Listen, at the end of the day, we always want to, uh, make sure that our sales match retail sales. 
That- that is- that is our key objective. That's how we- we make money. Uh, there will be always, uh, small fluctuations in- in the network. 
Uh, so I- I think in… given the magnitude of the changes that we experienced in the second quarter as- as a result of lower revenues 
and, um, the uncertainty that we still have in- in many places, I- 
I think that is, uh, it… that- that noise is not actually meaningful, in terms of explaining our performance and, uh, our, you know, trajectory over the next several months. 
Okay. And then, Don, on the portfolio reshaping, I'm curious. You know, the decision to exit ortho. I- 
I always thought part of the picture on the clear aligner was, you know, the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and- and, you know, leverage that, 
you know, strong ortho channel as you push- push out SureSmile. And I'm curious if, you know, if there is risk of dissynergies here. Um, and- and how you think about that? 
Yeah. Thanks Tycho. Um, a- we're- we're actually… There's a component of the, uh, you know the wire-bending aspect of- of SureSmile that we're keeping. 
Um, what, uh, when we say, uh, how we kinda delineate traditional orthopaedic, which is kind of the brackets, bands that would go straight up on 
a orthodon- t- an orthodontist using orthodontia. Uh, the- the… 
We believe hybrid is meaningful. We believe that it's- it's a differentiator for SureSmile. So we- we're actually keeping those components. 
So that piece of traditional ortho and the piece that actually came with your metrics 
acquisition is gonna stay with that. 
And then, you know, what we're seeing is we're- we're getting real traction on SureSmile tends to be, 
uh, s- you know, right now focused around our CEREC base. Um, y- you know, we kinda made that shift, 
uh, at y- basically in October of last year and that's part of the- the one DS 
program and we're seeing good traction there. So as we look going forward, we didn't feel that there were gonna be dissynergies associated with getting out of traditional, 
uh, y- you know, orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist, uh, group. 
So, uh, you know, as we focus on growing in the future, you know, we tend to think, 
all right, how do we take care of… 
Uh, how do we take advantage of our digital assets and- and how do we really look at expanding in- in places that, um, are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontia model. 
Okay. And then just lastly, any thoughts on just the capital equipment appetite as we think about the back half of the year and- and think about, you know, Primescan and Pr- Primemill. 
Can you just talk on to what degree you think there- there could be pent up demand and any need, on your part, to be a little bit more flexible in terms of financing, uh, or pricing potentially? 
Um, you know, it- it's been interesting. Tycho, w- j- even before, uh, the pandemic hit, we were really beginning to shift to one, uh, you know, our theory of one-visit dentistry and 
with Primemill and the speed of Primemill, it really made that a reality. I mean, you- you can get, uh, patients in and out with a single unit crown in- in, you know, an hour plus. 
Um, so we- we had made that shift 
and it was interesting, in- in April, when everything went down, we really shifted to a bunch of digital, 
uh, d- whether it was dem- product demonstrations or, you know, kinda taking people through what one-visit dentistry really means. And we got a pretty good reception. 
So what we've seen, uh, to date and- and you've actually seen the results that 
there's a pretty good appetite, uh, in our mind for technology and equipment. Now, whether it's spread e- across… You know, are we gonna see treatment centers and- and are we gonna see imaging. 
Not sure. But we- we feel very good about Primescan and Primemill and the opportunity for dentists 
who are, you know, b- basically gonna be dealing with the patient population that may be a little bit, 
Hey, uh, do I wanna go to the dentist three times in- in, uh, you know during the pandemic to get a crown fixed, or 
can I get that done one time? You- you're also seeing a lot of dentists that we've been talking to and we've been seeing a fair amount of success, 
um, with saying, Hey, look. I've got to change how I practice, and they use the… kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that. 
So we're, uh… W- we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment, uh, space in the back half and, uh, and a large part is due to the, 
first, the new products we pushed out but also the change in messaging and how we're pitching the- 
pitching these products. 
So ultimately… And, you know, look we're working with our dealer partners globally right now to- to make sure that we're helping dentists access this material, uh, you know, but we're… 
Do I s- do I see a- a whole bunch of pricing pressure and- and you know, crazy financing options coming on our technology and equipment? No. Okay. Thank you. 
Thanks, Tycho. Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Hey. Thanks. Uh, good morning everybody. Um, a couple of quick questions for you. You know, first your comment around July being, uh, fairly flat year over year on a global basis is obviously pretty positive and 
I don't wanna give any, uh, specific guidance but just kind of eyeballing the three consensus estimates for the third quarter. 
Uh, they call for revenues to be down some 20% to 25% year over year. So 
I'm just wondering, based on what you're seeing in July 
and, you know, barring any other major changes in, uh, the landscape, does that… You know, is that a number that seems like maybe that's too conservative on the revenue outlook as far as where consensus is? Just curious to get your thoughts around that. 
Steve, good morning. Jorge here. 
Um, listen, i- it is- it is early for us to, uh, be able to extrapolate, um, from the July numbers. 
Uh, and as, uh, as you can appreciate, uh, there is a lot of, uh, different data points coming from, uh, different regions 
and, uh, there are some markets that are doing much better, uh, in terms of the number of offices that are open, markets that are good from a volume perspective. 
We still have lingering concerns in places like Australia, parts of, uh, Latin America and there are some spots in- in Europe that are also, uh, still challenging. 
So… And it is- it is very hard to, um, make a judgment with respect to, uh, those numbers. 
I think, uh, what we are… what… We're really encouraged by the fact that sequentially, the last, uh, three months have been, you know, moving in the right direction. 
But from a planning perspective, uh, internally, we- we are- we're trying to… we continue to work with scenario planning. 
We- we are, uh, preparing the company for- for a multiple, uh, set of, uh, of outcomes in the next, uh, in the next few, uh, months and quarters. I think it's important thing to do. 
So, um, uh, har- hard to tell you, uh, if- if that number is right or not. Okay. That's helpful. 
One other quick, uh, clarification question. On the exiting of the traditional orthodontics and parts of the analog lab business, 
are these businesses that could be monetized through asset sales or are these just full shutdowns? 
Maybe just give us a little more color around the decision tree on shutdown, versus asset sale. 
Yeah, Steve. Um, you know, as we look at it right now, we're- we're making the announcement, uh, to, get it done. 
Obviously, we'll look to dispose the assets in the- in the way that it's most beneficial to the company. 
If, uh, you know there's some asset sales, we'll certainly look at it. If- if it's a full shutdown… Uh, 
you know, we- we gave you guys the- the numbers based on, uh, you know the worst case scenario, and obviously, we're gonna work to improve that. 
Um, but- but again, uh, the- the process because, uh, you know, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's multiple plants 
in multiple locations. You know, obviously you start with the works council and- and you go through a lot of different things but, 
you know, the- the numbers we gave you represent, uh, you know, the base case and- and we're gonna work hard to improve, versus that and there is the opportunity to- to do better than what we said. 
Okay. All right. Appreciate the extra comment. 
Thanks. Thanks Steve. Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Uh, good morning and- and thanks for the questions. I- 
I wanna just dive back into the July, um, commentary, specifically. I apologize to keep harping on this but just wanna make sure this is clear as possible. Y- uh, 
Jorge, are you saying that what you s- have seen so far in July, on a total dollar basis, uh, across the book is similar to 2019? 
Is there any way, specifically, to th- to think about how that's factoring into the US, in particular, in terms of the 
m- the- the quantity of dollar basis versus some of the other growth rates, where there might be some countries 
that did not have any meaningful COVID spikes that could be growing clearly at a faster <inaudible>? 
Yeah. Uh, Michael, thanks for the question. 
We- we are still trying to digest all the July numbers. Uh, there is a lot of, uh, a lot of data to look at from a product perspective, from a geography perspective. 
Uh, a- as I- as I indicated before, um, July definitely trended better than June. 
Um, so, uh, that- that- that is very good. Uh, but it is, uh, it- it depends on the region, it depends on the- on the geography and at this… O- on- a- and on the products. 
At this point, I can't give you a breakdown. Um, because, uh, there is some- some analytics that we need… we still need to do. 
Overall, um, the, um, the- the total portfolio, uh, is- is getting closer to, uh, ' 19 numbers. 
And in some instances, uh, i- it did better than, uh, than 201. 
And, uh, and- and that is, uh, definitely a substantial improvement, uh, versus- versus June. 
Yeah, and then just one more question o- on aligners. How do you think about the differentiation strategy that you're gonna go forward with? 
I know a lot of it was tied historically to the integration you had, 
um, with Omnicam and- and with- and with CEREC and- and everything. 
And a- as you think about where you compete, y- you know, every aligner seems to have its own specific angle on what makes it better. 
Where do you think that SureSmile will shake out as what makes it better, the best or what x-ray <inaudible> office differentiates the name with everyone 
else. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I- I would say that it's our system. 
Um, look, between Omni and Primescan, 
uh, you know, we think we've got a pretty installed base. 
Uh, we- we have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license. 
So when we can add something that's integrated and seamless like SureSmile into- into the package, and particularly, 
you know, when we came out with, uh, SureSmile 7.6, 
uh, it… and it- it's really seamlessly integrated, uh, into, y- you know our base, uh, digital assets. 
It- it becomes really easy to use and, you know, we feel with 7.6, you know, we're now able to compete across the broad- broad portfolio into class one, class two, class three. 
Uh, we- we think that our treatment planning, uh, software is second to none. I mean, we- we feel it's, uh, uh, really, really competitive. 
And, um, you know, we're very comfortable with the clinical results we're seeing and as we go into, uh, y- you know, kind of our installed base, we feel very good about that right now. 
Um, a- and look, every single day, 
uh, we get better and better at beginning to think about Dentsply Sirona, not as- as individual product companies where we're sitting there saying, Hey, we're gonna go sell you an Omni, we're gonna go sell you a Prime 
and then oh by the way, maybe next week somebody will come in with SureSmile. No. It's- it's really… W- r- we've begun to focus much more 
on how do we, uh, focus on the customer as- as one company and- and as part of that one company approach, stuff like, uh, DS1. 
Uh, you know 1DS, excuse me. 
Uh, we really are going in and saying, Hey, look. 
How- how do you think about using these digital assets to, 
you know, w- make life easier around doing orthodontics with clear aligners? 
How do you really think about implants differently? And- and 
again, we're- we're working hard to actually bring this idea that- that we're the dental solutions company to reality. 
Does that answer your question, sir? 
Yes. <crosstalk>. Michael, we lost you. No. Still here. Thanks, thanks for the comment. Thank you. And our next question is from Jason, um, Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. 
Good morning. Uh, thanks for taking the questions here. Uh, Don and Jorge, uh, thanks for all the restructuring plan cover. 
Uh, wondering in the orthodontic business, I mean, you- you've mentioned here a few times leveraging the CEREC installed base with clear aligners. Uh, 
I think it makes a ton of sense but I mean, should we interpret your CEREC comments to be that you're- 
you're gonna be emphasizing SureSmile principally in the GP channel? Or do you have a strategy to 
continue to target the orthodontist channel that doesn't have that same CEREC owner base? 
Yeah. Um, look, we- w- we're happy to take SureSmile into the orthodontist office and- and the GP office. 
You know, what we're seeing is a- again we wanna play to our strengths and we- we do have a large installed base. And when we do programs like 1DS, uh, we're… 
You know, we're- we're obviously trying to package, uh, you know, workflows together in such a way that we're… that there's real benefit to the dentist. 
We're seeing more success there so look, we will continue to pitch, uh, SureSmile across both the orthodontics- orthodontic as well as the GP channel. 
Um, we think we've got more innate advantages in the- in the GP channel right now. 
That's helpful. Okay and then I, uh, wanted to ask actually a new product question here, actually, partially related to the prior question. 
And I appreciate the policy here not to discuss new products before they're officially launched. 
Um, but instead of talking specifically to the recently approved large field of view imaging system or, uh, maybe any 3D printing plans you might have with Primeprint. 
Uh, maybe you could talk to what you see in the- in the market, from an opportunity or a demand perspective, for each of those categories. Um, each of large field of view and also in office 3D 
printing. Thanks. Uh, on you know, wide field of view i- I… we're filling a gap in our portfolio, 
um, that you- you know, we- w- it took us a little while to get there but we feel very good about that right now. 
And if you look at what we've done with, you know, our Orthophos SL and our <unk>, 
uh, and now wide field of view, we- we feel that we're very competitive in the imaging space. And, 
uh, you know, uh, now in terms of where do we think about the macro demand, uh, for imaging equipment. 
Again, uh, s- you know, if you look over the last six months and- and again, the pandemic really started, 
you know, at the end of, uh, the first quarter and we've seen regions begin to recover. 
Uh, you know we've seen good solid demand a- across the board in technology and equipment. 
And, uh, you know it's… 
When you start looking at things like wide field of view 
it- it's really not necessarily about, y- you know, I'm just replacing my x-ray machinery. 
It's- it's what procedures do I wanna do and, you know, wide field of view and- and particularly, when you start looking at 
2D and 3D, uh, kind of imaging products, 
it lets you do more procedures. It lets you do better implants, it lets you do better endo, it lets you do better orthodontia. So, 
um, you know, we- we think the demand, you know, is it gonna gyrate a little bit as we recover from the pi- pandemic. It- it could. 
But, uh, you know we've seen demand remain pretty solid on there 
and in- in terms of- of printing, 
you know, we- we haven't really discussed that and, you know, look our- our… one of the challenges in- in, um, in this space, 
uh, you know versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out, 
uh, you know, we- we tend to play things pretty close to the vest. 
Uh, what- what I would tell you is that our new product portfolio 
work has been one of… You know, we kept saying in the prepared remarks, you know, we stayed focused on our key strategic initiatives. Well, one of those is new products 
and, uh, you know, th- what we've been working on internally is how do we take the- the five to 10 most important products, whether that's in the endo or implant or in the technology and equipment space 
and keep making progress on it. 
And- and we, you know, are… we're not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launch- launches. 
And- and you know, again, we think it positioned us well as- as people come out of the pandemic. All right. 
Thanks very much guys. Thanks Jason. Thank you. Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning guys. Um, I just was wondering if we… if you could help us put some numbers around, uh, the new ortho strategy. 
Um, can you talk about, um, the vol-… y- you know, maybe some comments about how you saw volumes trend within orthodontics? And then 
also, is there anything that you can talk about in terms of the size of the revenue base and g- or… and/or growth rates, would be helpful just in terms of framing that opportunity on a go forward basis. Thank you. 
Yeah, thanks Elizabeth. Um, you know, it's funny, we- we- we haven't broken out, 
uh, you know the total orthodontia business and we don't give, uh, the clear aligner numbers specifically. What I would tell you is that, 
uh, what we've seen, uh, over the last year is accelerating growth behind SureSmile. 
Uh, and- and we've seen actually very positive trends even coming out of the pandemic. So that's one of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision. 
Um, uh, look, we- we feel that, uh, Dentsply Sirona has an opportunity to become a solid number two in the space and we're gonna work toward that. 
Um, so you- you know, can do some math around that. 
Uh, 
look, ultimately, you know, we- we've been pretty consistent saying we wanna grow and 
we wanna do margin accretions. So the steps we're taking around getting out of the traditional 
ortho business and really focusing on clear aligners, helps us do that. So y- you know, w- our- our bet and belief is that the clear aligner space is- is gonna be a significant contributor 
to our aggregate growth rate over time. Okay. 
Perfect. That's helpful. And then, you know, given obviously you guys have a pretty, um, substantial liquidity position right now, 
how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that, you know, hopefully we're through the worst of COVID and things continue to, uh, improve from here? 
Uh, yeah, good morning. Listen, our- our capital deployment philosophies, um, 
a- are not changing, have not changed. 
I think, uh, it was, uh, absolutely the right thing to, uh, raise more liquidity to, uh, be in a position of a strength from a financial standpoint. 
Uh, we were encouraged actually by, uh, a number of shareholders to- to be in that position, which we totally agree with. 
At this point, we want to, um, keep, uh, doing what we're doing, being very fluent with our balance sheet, being, uh, very diligent with our cash flow. 
Uh, you probably noticed in the- in the second quarter, we had a very strong operating cash flow. Got very good free cash flow. 
And, um, all our parts of our deployment uh, will… You know, are- are not changing for now. We paid- paid our dividends, um, and we have no plans to change our dividend at this time. 
Once, uh, things go back to, uh, to a more, uh, normal level, uh, we'll reassess where we are at that point. 
We will look at all of the, 
uh, demands for capital, uh, opportunities that we have at that time and, uh, we'll make, uh, whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders 
as we deploy that capital. 
Uh, but for now, I think the- the focus is on- o- on the recovery is how, uh, to ensure that we have a very stable, financial position. 
Uh, how we are able to, uh, fund, uh, strategic initiatives, some of, uh, which, uh, Don has talked about that. 
Uh, we want to make sure that even in a low revenue environment, uh, and low profitability environment, we- we- we keep funding those initiatives. 
And- and that is one of the reasons we have, uh, we have that- that- that capital. We- we want to keep investing in the organic growth of the company, uh, for the time being. Okay. 
Thank you very much. That's helpful. Thanks, Elizabeth. Thanks, Elizabeth. Thank you. And our next question is from Steve <unk> with <unk> Research. Please go ahead. 
Uh, hi. Good morning, and- and thanks for the time here. Uh, I wanted to ask one very specific question and then one kinda big picture question. Uh, the specific one is actually about Germany. Uh, 
I wonder, you know, to what extent you'd be willing to talk about growth in Germany, operating conditions there. 
Uh, and- and to what extent you think that, uh, a good barometer for, you know, what the business might look like over the next several months in the event that we… 
you know, we get the virus under- under control? And then I have a- 
a- a follow-up on strategy after that. 
Yeah, thanks Steve. Um, you know, conditions in Germany are- are… uh, if- if you were gonna go around the world, are pretty good. 
Um, y- you know, a- and again, I think Jorge said it well, that it de- it depends on the business 
and y- 
y- you know, uh, uh, th- there's been different reactions to different, uh, different businesses and- and we kinda look at <inaudible> together which is, you know, Germany, uh, Switzerland and- and Austria. 
Uh, but- but conditions there, if it… if that's a harbinger of the future, 
uh, would- would tell you that, uh, you know things do get closer to normal. I mean, there's obviously… You 
know, again, the same things we see over here, uh, that we keep tracking is what's office capacity, 
you know, around the new infection protocols 
and again, that keeps getting better. Uh, y- you know, things are better in July than they were in June just as- as the, uh, dentist and their staff get more used to that. And then patient attitudes. 
Uh, it's interesting, the- the, uh, the patient tracking that we did in Germany showed, uh, that you know, 
th- the… from a patient perspective, 
there was less change in, uh, Germany than there was in the US around, uh, the pandemic. So there seems to be a little bit more of a, uh, stable attitude toward 
visiting the dentist's office. 
So, you know, ultimately, if- if things look like Germany, it points to the fact that, uh, things do get back to normal. 
Okay. Much appreciated. And then, Don, I- I wanted to- to borrow from- from your experience a little bit if I could. You- you're a- you're a med tech guy. 
And you came into dental with, uh, a different perspective on, you know, what the industry could be and, you know, how businesses could run and 
COVID has certainly… it changed, you know, some of that thinking. I- 
I wonder, as you- y- you keep your med tech hat on and- and you think about what you want the business to look like 
and, you know, how practice evolves, you know, over the next, you know, however many quarters or, uh, or months and we get to the point where, you know, we're in a new post- COVID normal. 
How is your thinking… Uh, how has your thinking evolved in terms of, you know, what you want the business to be, what you think the practice looks like? Uh, 
I know you have a- a focus on digital, you know, that was there before. 
Uh, can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might've learned in the last few months, and how your thinking has evolved on that future, strategic, uh, vision? Thank you. 
Thanks Steve. Um, y- you know, I- I- 
I think what COVID has done has b- has brought into sharper focus what I think, 
uh, the industry is gonna need to be and, uh, you know whether it gets there in two years, three years, five years. Um, I- 
I think it's gonna accelerate a- a couple of trends. I mean the first is that, you know, I- I think DSOs, uh, are- are going to pick up. Uh, you know, 
I don't think it's gonna happen in the- in the- in the immediate short term, but I- I think, 
uh, if- if you look at, in Europe, uh, and the US and- and even in places in Asia Pacific where the pandemic exposed, 
you know, sometimes, uh, some of the offices are- are kind of right on the margin and the dentist may feel it's better to practice in a larger group. So I think there- there, you- you may see a shift that way. 
I think the second big thing is, y- you know, the- the idea of, uh, when you say digital, I- I push digital pretty hard. 
Uh, in- in my mind, what- what I think whether it's the DSO's or the individual dentists are gonna be doing, is they're really gonna be evaluating their practice more critically. 
And I think COVID, uh, brought that into sharp focus. That, hey, look, I've got 40 hours to see patients. How am I, 
uh, allocating time against procedures, uh, and- and- and how am I thinking about, you know, what procedures can I do and what procedures do I really wanna develop within the practice 
and I'm gonna ad- uh, I'm gonna address that accordingly 
from the equipment and where I emphasize, um, you know, our training and- and whatnot. 
So, you know, uh, I- I think what we've seen with clear aligners is- is something, uh, that's gonna go into the rest of dentistry. 
Uh, y- you know, when you think about implants, uh, when you think about even, uh, basic endo work, I- 
I think the increased digitization of diagnostics and- and how that can help, uh, dentists practice at the highest level of their licenses is- is- is- it's- it's going to accelerate. So 
I would- I would say Steve, uh, 
I don't think anything's dramatically changed. Uh, strategically, what I think it- 
it's- it- y- you know, and- and you read all the books and you know, after major disruptions and dislocations, you tend to see new trends go. I- 
I think what might've taken a decade because dental tends to be a little bit slower than what- what we saw in med tech, uh, 
I think is gonna accelerate pretty dramatically. 
I couldn't agree more. Thanks for all the, uh, the help here. All right. Thanks Steve. Stay safe. 
Thank you. And our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Hi, thanks very much. Uh, Don, curious. Could you give us an update on the, uh, your integration efforts? And, uh, I- 
I'm sure COVID has impacted them a little bit, but you had a pretty long list across commercial manufacturing and R&D. 
Just kind of give us a sense about where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has kind of altered the- the thinking around them? 
Um, y- y- you know, John, uh, first thanks for the question. Y- you know, when… I- 
I would say, when we outlined things in November of, uh, ' 18, you know, we kinda said it was a three-year program. Um, I- 
I would say that, uh, and particularly with the announcements we made this morning a- around traditional ortho and analog lab, 
uh, i- it kind of points to the fact that we're pushing a little bit faster and we're pushing harder. I think the, uh, pandemic has accelerated our- our thinking and, um, y- you know, 
uh, look when you- when you see the revenue, uh, challenges in the second quarter, it- it also highlights, 
you know, some of the things that we need to get after even faster. So that's kind of what I would tell you. 
Um, uh, I- I w- it-- it's really interesting, internally, uh, we keep trying to tell people, Hey, look, it's not as if we're gonna get the restructuring done and then that's it. 
Uh, you know, we're not changing ever again. So I've been trying to condition the organization to understand that this is a marathon and- and, uh, 
you know the restructuring might have- have been only the first 10K of that. 
Uh, so, uh, look, I- I- I would tell you in terms of the plan we laid out, 
we're- we're, uh, more than halfway done. 
Um, but I would also tell you, uh, b- uh, you know, it's great as I brought in a new team, with people like Jorge, 
we've got a terrific supply chain leader, we've actually now got all the, uh, commercial people reporting into one pe- one person, Walter Peterson. 
Uh, we're finding more and more stuff that we think that we can, uh, improve on that should have y- you know, r- r- really deliver the promise of what Dentsply Sirona should be. So, y- you know, look, 
specifically, 
hey, uh, you know, if you thought it was a three-year restructuring, w- you know, we're- we're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be. 
I would just tell you that we're commit… our management team is committed to, as soon as we get done that restructuring, we're- we're not stopping. We're, How do we continuously improve? 
Uh, that's great. Thanks. And- and then one last question. How was your implant portfolio performing? 
How did it do in the second quarter and, uh, are y- are you rethinking that line up at all? 
Uh, implants is… Uh, you know, we've been happy with our implant business. 
Um, I- I would tell you, uh, y- you know, when you say the second quarter, John, it- 
it's- it's an interesting challenge in terms of what language do you use, you know? Implants did well relative but you know, versus prior year, uh, y- you know, across the whole portfolio was challenging. 
Um, w- as we talk and think, rethink about our portfolio, you know, look we- we think we- we've started to actually get our new products where we need to get them. 
Um, you know, ob- obviously, we've talked about our immediate load Astra EV product and- and 
I think that's the first of what you'll see a- a pretty, uh, regular set of introductions over the next 18 months in our- in our implant space that are gonna really let us be competitive. 
The other thing that we've been doing, uh, with implants that, you know, doesn't get a lot of highlight, 
is, you know, we have a- a- a business MIS that we had bought a couple years back, which lets us play a little bit more aggressively in the value segment 
and, uh, as- as we've been rethinking how we approach commer- our commercial go-to market strategy across all Dentsply Sirona including, um, implants. 
Being able to integrate that and expand that beyond the base of- of what they used to operate in when we bought them is… has been beneficial there. 
So, you know, we feel that implants remains a significant growth opportunity for us. I would say that, um, you know, we're starting to get the portfolio where we need to get it. Uh, 
I'm extremely uh, excited about what I think the- the new products, uh, in that space are gonna be able to, uh, deliver for us, you know, over the next, 
you know, couple years. Sounds good. Thank you. 
Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Uh, this is Trevor. On for Jon. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Um, so you… I think you mentioned earlier that your patient tracking is saying that, y- con-… uh, patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently. 
I'm wondering if there's any detail you can give there on just, like, how that's shaken out geographically, and if there's a read-through to, you know, potentially some of your July comments, 
um, you know, through that confidence level? 
Yeah, sure. Thanks Trevor. 
Um, a couple things. I- I mean, first, we're- we're doing patient tracking a- across the entire globe. 
Uh, and- and again, we- we've seen consistent improvement a- around, you know, people likely to visit the dentist and- and we measure likely to visit 
in the- in the, you know, the next 30 days, the next quarter and whatnot. So we've been seeing consistent improvement 
across the board there. Interestingly, there's a kind of a subgroup. People have been to the dentist have had really positive experiences around how people… You know, whether it's, 
you know, adjusting waiting room or, uh, you know how they're addressing infection protocols. 
So we see that group as pretty positive. 
Um, one- one of the things we were trying to watch as they were kinda the flare-ups in the US, in- in particular, geographies, whether there was going to be a drop-off in- in patient confidence. And we didn't see that. 
So, y- you know, look, I- I… And- and by the way, uh, while, most of the patient data is good, 
there is some reluctance on, you know, kind of a- a segment of the population to say, you know, am I gonna go back in the next month 
versus, do I intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months. 
So you know, there's a little bit of a lag there, um, that- that we see, uh, particularly in the US but we don't see it, uh, else- elsewhere around the world. 
So patient- patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and- and a- again, we're- we're seeing, um, we're seeing some good positive things there. 
Yeah. Thank you. And then just one more on DSOs. You know, we've been hearing that DSOs in large practices are tending to perform better in this environment. I'm just wondering if, 
you know, that's what you've been seeing and if you think that, um, you know, some of the smaller, uh, more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch-up there as well. 
Um, we… To- to be honest, Trevor, we haven't seen a- a- a- a huge differentiation between the, uh, the DSOs and- and the individual practices. 
You know, the things that- that we love about this market is that, 
you know, the… whether the… You know, there's 600,000 dentists ar- around the world. 
Um, and, uh, and they're independent business owners 
and they're… a lot of them are very, very inventive and creative about how they, you know, go after and- and make sure that they're reaching out to their patients and whatnot. 
So I- I… Uh, look, do I think on the margin if- if somebody was considering retiring in a year or two and- and COVID hit, you know, 
do they sit there and say may-… now, maybe is the time that I accelerate that? 
Yeah. Uh, you- you might see a little bit of that but, 
you know, we haven't seen a, uh, a sharp change in the number of dental practices that we're doing business with 
and, y- you know, we think that, uh… We- we haven't seen a drop-off in the aggregate number of dental practices in key regions post- COVID. 
So when we- when we're watching… You know, when we say things are 80% open, 90% open, 99, 
we haven't seen the, um, the number of practices that we're measuring that against change. Great. Thank you so much. Thanks Trevor. 
Thank you. And with- and with that, we conclude our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to John Sweeney for his final remarks. 
Thank you very much everybody. We look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year. Have a good day. 
Thank you ladies and gentlemen for participating in today's program. And you may now disconnect and have a great day.
