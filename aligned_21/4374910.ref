Good morning. This is Craig Moore with Autonomous. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fifth annual Future of Commerce Symposium. 
Sorry for the brief delay in getting started. 
I just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started. 
Um, you can use the same dialing or web link for the entire day. 
There'll be a few breaks, but for many of the sessions, we will just move right into the next, uh, the next discussion. 
You can submit questions, uh, to us via, uh, email to myself or <unk>. Uh, 
you can also use Bloomberg IV to find us with questions or you can use the q&a box within, uh your Zoom window. 
Um, so with, with no further ado, let's get started. 
Um, we're lucky to have with us this morning, 
American Express Doug Buckminster group head Global Consumer Services. 
It's great to see you again, Doug. I wish it was in person. I wish it was in Carnegie Hall, but maybe next year. 
How are you? Exactly. It's great, great to see you too Craig. Thanks, for having me. 
Yeah, you bet. 
Um, so, um, love the background, love the image, um, but- <laugh>. let me, 
uh… while we get started with just, you know, a, a, um, a broad question, which is, you know, can you update us on the state of consumer and overall spending at this point in the recovery? 
Yeah. You know, I, I think, um, as we've talked about before, we saw the trough in April, and we've seen a rebound since then. You know, 
I would characterize, uh, the trend since mid July as relatively stable on the non TNT side. 
So outside of TNT relatively stable, little bouncing around due to days mix timing of holidays, like Labor Day in particular. 
And slow, very steady growth, but, but slow growth on the TNT side. Right? 
So I, I would say stable would be the, the adjective that captures that dust. 
Okay. Um, at this point, I assume… 
could we perhaps characterize this a little, go a little deeper on this ex TNT, um, 
if you were to characterize the overall volumes, you're seeing ex TNT ex corporate card, 
you know, really are consumers getting back toward positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point? Yeah. 
I mean, I think, you know, consumers consume, right? They're gonna figure out a way, uh, to live their life and, um, and enrich their lives. 
And I would say, 
while there's a lot of substitution in the non candy space, especially physical for, for online and e-com, 
I would say, we feel good, that healthy levels of consumer volumes there, um, 
I think what's gonna, what's gonna define the trajectory of, uh, volume rebound from here on out is, 
uh, is the direction of TNT, which, which you know, is a category, uh, we over index on. 
So maybe some thoughts there. 
You know, Amex has a deeper understanding of TNT than I think any other 
card issuer, especially considering the network and the insights you get off of that, um, on a global basis. 
So maybe, uh, your thoughts on how we recover from this. Are there any green shoots you're seeing in TNT at all, at this point? 
I mean, I think, um, you know, my position is consumer travel will come back. Um, 
I think that's our, our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back. It's an essential part of, 
uh, the consumer experience, especially in our demographic. Um, 
I think, you know, what we've seen to date in terms of the rebound 
is an effect of substitution. So people substituting driving vacations, homestay rentals for you know, uh, for air based travel. 
And in some categories, we've seen innovation as well, right? I've seen the dining space in particular 
expansion of outdoor dining, pick up, take away delivery, at home meal prep, 
uh, that level of innovation has, uh, has bounced, uh, the restaurant category, 
more than you would expect, just from dying in volumes alone. Right? 
Um, so I think, you know, where, when we get back to historic levels, I think is, is largely a question of, of confidence and medical solutions, right. 
I think, I, 
I think, uh, the establishment of the vaccine, the approval 
of the vaccine, I expect, 
will unleash a lot of anticipatory and pent up demand on consumers. 
They will start travel planning again, the interest in travel based payment products, 
and travel based loyalty currencies, I think will, 
will spike is all that pent up demand for travel, 
people start to see the end in sight, though they start to build confidence that in a six to 12 month time period. 
Uh, they'll be able to travel again. But I think getting back to historic, uh, volumes is gonna require that. mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
And in terms of how that affects the discount rate at American Express, 
um, especially without the long haul cro… 
the, the long haul travel, um, maybe a, a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out. 
Yeah. Well, there's no, there's no question 
that, um, the TNT volumes, taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate. Right? 
So I think, 
um, you know, the discount rate we, we've been on record for a few years now saying we, 
we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on 
driving discount revenue and utility through programs like dark blue, certain b2b categories, 
um, but there's no question, you know, that historic discount rate has taken a mix related impact as a result of 
really a disproportionate fall in, uh, in TNT, TNT 
spend. Okay. We'll, we'll, we'll move off of that, that topic that isn't, uh, helpful right now in terms of the dynamic, 
but maybe on to something that is, which is, you know, can you discuss how spending habits have changed? 
You know, and to what degree you're seeing these habits, you know, coalesce into long term, uh, repeatable 
behavior, you know, especially around e-com contactless- 
Yeah. and if it's different between consumer segments. Yeah. You know, 
I think, um, my take on the effects of 
this crisis are that it didn't create any new trends, but it changed sort of the slope of pre existing trends, 
right? e-commerce was taking share from offline. 
Digital payments were taking share from cash at POS, right? 
And we have seen a, an inflection or kink in those curves, uh, as most issuers have over the last, uh, six months, 
you know, whether we've seen those trends accelerated by year, two years, it's anybody's guess. But I don't think, 
I don't think we're going backwards from those trends as the crisis, uh, as the crisis relaxes. Um, you know, 
I think on the contactless side, 
you know, there's a lot of noise around that. 
There are markets outside the US, as you know, 
Southeast Asia, Australia, the UK, where there's very deep, uh, contactless penetration and, um, and that has continued to gain share during this crisis. 
In the US, the contactless volumes are much more modest. 
They are increasing at a rapid rate. But I do expect that the move away from cash, and the comfort with using credit products, even for micro level transactions at POS, 
uh, will be an enduring outcome of this. 
And I, I think, um, while I don't think it does a lot per se, to drive dollar volumes of billings, 
I think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of, of credit products. 
And in some markets outside the US where e-com is less established, 
it's had a more profound effect like Italy is a face-to-face retail market. 
We've seen phenomenal growth in e-commerce. What's interesting is, 
well over 50% of the participants in e-commerce in any month during the first few months 
of the crisis, had never had an e-commerce transaction on Amex before. 
Wow. Um, so there we've seen some real, um… I, I, I again, I think it's a trend that would have played out, but it was a very large acceleration of that trend. 
And correct me if I'm wrong, but Amex has a, 
a better acceptance footprint outside the US in e-ecom than it does in brick and mortar. 
I… yeah. I would say that's probably true, uh, by large due to partnerships with various PSPs and aggregators and such, 
we have a really strong footprint in, in e-com. 
Okay. 
Um, so in terms of, uh, the health of the US consumer, the health of the consumer in general, 
you know, especially considering high, higher unemployment, furloughs, unemployment claims, you know, as we saw this morning, 
um, it's been remarkable how well the industry is faring right now. 
Um, you know, I noticed that Amex is, uh, credit quality is at its best point over the last 12 months on consumer, 
and, shockingly, its best point over the last three years in small business. 
And so 
maybe some context there be, you know, discovers, uh, CEO, uh, 
did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect the material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year, so just your perspective. Yeah. 
I mean, um, look, 
I think most issuers have seen a more modest impact than would have been implied by the end of Q1, qualitative reserves that they took, right? 
I think, looking at macro indicators around Unemployment Claims changes in sequential GDP. 
You know, uh, 
if you were sitting back being an armchair credit manager, you would have expected, um, much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write offs. 
And the fact of the matter is, as you say, we have, uh, we have not seen them as most issuers haven't play out of, by and large. 
Now, there are a number of contributors to that right, I would say the jobless claims, 
the geography of those the, the demographics of those jobless claims, 
you know, uh, uh, weren't as concentrated in our customer base, our member base, um, as the macro numbers would suggest. Uh, 
I would also say as everyone knows, there's just a ton of liquidity in the system right now, whether it's through government programs, private sector forbearance programs, 
um, and so you're right, 
we have, we have credit quality and delinquency and right off side that are better year on year, uh, than, uh, than they were, um, you know, 
I think we have to while, while we're pleased with that, 
we also have a healthy level of, you know, paranoia about what the next 12 months will bring, right? 
The macro economy, some of these forbearance programs with 10% of residential mortgages being in forbearance, 
that kind of going away government support, um, 
moderating, uh, perhaps private sector follow through in terms of white collar job losses. 
So, you know, we feel great about the early innings of this crisis, but you know, we're mindful that it's, it's not over. 
You know, just… are there any signs in the portfolio at all, that would be concerning? 
You know, look, I think in the, in the commercial or small business portfolio, clearly, there are industries that are more affected by this. Fortunately, they tend to be 
industries where our concentration is, uh, is lower, 
you know, there, there are some, some things about this crisis have actually improved visibility in a way. 
I mean, we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors, right? 
Which allows us to kinda target and think about the precision of our underwriting and existing customer management, 
a little bit more crisply, but, but I would say there are, there are no real hotspots within the portfolio right now. You know, I, 
I would say, 
you know, back in April, May, all of us had these sort of short term crisis relief programs, right, where 
payment holiday, no interest charged, and, 
you know, type thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane, 
and we, we made a, uh, a judgment that 
we weren't gonna kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs. We were gonna, we were gonna move customers if they needed to move 
on to longer term solutions for repayment confidence, right? So our 12 month financial relief program, which, 
you know, allows customers to reduce their, uh, minimum payment, maintain their membership, they don't get their membership canceled, 
and retain some level of spend utility as well, right? And we think that, uh, that, that has allowed us to transition the portfolio, um, in a very customer friendly way, in a way that has stabilized the receivables metrics as well. 
Okay. Um, 
I wanna keep this… try to keep this conversation with investors. 
So investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that, um, I'll just read it for you. 
Basically, you've made it clear that TNT spend recovery is very linked to COVID resolution. 
You know, as customers currently divert that spending toward non TNT purchases, how is Amex able to increase their share 
of customer spending in non TNT and how meaningfully can that move the needle on billings growth? 
Yeah. I mean, I think it's a great question. I mean, one of the things, you know we did early in this crisis is decide that we were gonna focus on existing customers. 
Um, the visibility around large scale prospect acquisition was challenged, 
our value propositions tend to index on TNT, as we've noted, and so we said job, one was taking care of existing customers, which caused us to make, um, a long term balance of year, um, large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant, right for the times type of value. And that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining, food delivery, 
our wireless and streaming credits on our, our platinum product promotions with Amazon and other, um, other merchant partners. And, you know, we're measuring success right now, in terms of how effectively we retain our customers, 
and especially the customers that drive 50 to 60% of our margin on an annual basis, 
and how well, we compete within their wallets per share of wallet. 
And on both of those metrics, which we track very closely. And at a very granular level, 
we feel really good about how well we're competing, uh, for our customers' business. 
And, you know, I think we've, we've built some confidence here that, 
you know, as certain natural hedges in our business take effect, so people aren't visiting lounges as much. 
It, it frees up resources for us to create new, more relevant value for our customers. 
That's what we did this year, it has worked for us so far, uh, we're in the early innings. 
Um, and we're confident that we can and we'll do that going forward as well. 
You know, we also just need to, I think, think about we, we 
think about our co-brand products as like travel products. 
Actually, like 90% of the spend on a number of our large co-brands is in non TNT categories, right? 
What they're doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future. 
And so that billing base isn't as effective as long as consumers believe in the long term value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can, they can gain access to. 
So it sounds like you're implying that the co-branded portfolios or performing the travel related co-brand portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios? 
Yeah. There are, um, they're performing no worse than other portfolios. 
Look, there are portfolios that we have that are doing extraordinarily well, right, certain real a… retail co-brands, whether it's 
the small business co-brand with Amazon, whether it's other department store co-brands we have outside of the US, 
um, but if you were to look at our US, 
uh, certainly our cashback products as all cashback products in the industry, that rational shore value 
is performing very well. But I think we've been on record saying, you know, say our delta portfolio 
has experienced a more modest compression of billings, 
than our US portfolios at large. Interesting. 
Um, well count me one of those co-brand, uh, holders with Delta. Uh, hopefully I get to use some of those miles at some point soon. I think my family would appreciate that 
<laugh>. That, that's the pent up demand I'm talking about right? We all feel that way. Oh, I see <crosstalk>. Haven't seen my father in six months. It's there. It's definitely there. 
Um, so, okay. 
Um, let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly, Amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems. 
Amex has historically, um, kept their spending levels and sup, and supportive consumers at a higher level through crisis and I think that's because of the returns Amex has via the network. 
So have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what's been the response? 
Yeah. You know, I 
am… they, they always say crisis, uh, build character. They like reveal character to both individuals and institutions, and 
I've been around Amex a long time. 
Um, 
I'm very proud of the way we've kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis. I mean, in the times of greatest uncertainty, 
uh, we signed up for an extraordinary level of value injection, both the product level value I described as well as what we've done with our three month shop small program, 
um, when we had our least visibility, we doubled down on, uh, on our customers. 
Um, and as I said earlier, I think it's paid real dividends for us we track, 
um, spend share within our members wallets, and there's no question that back in like, April, we took a hit, 
and we have climbed back, um, as a result of that value injection, and some really dialed up customer, uh, marketing. 
Um, as I think Steve and Jeff have both said, we see, uh, retention rates that are superior, to 2019 right now within our base. 
And, you know, I think we've talked about it before. They're better than they were in 2019. And our retention rates in general, 
are just extraordinarily high. I mean, we, we retain 
more than 98% of our billings base year to year. Okay. 
I don't, I don't think I've heard that stat before. So that's a… it's definitely a good one to write down. 
Um, 
so, uh, wanted to ask about lending, lending… Amex is getting more creative. 
And its lending products, 
there was recently, uh, a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum. 
Um, so maybe you can discuss how Amex is expanding its lending if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet, which I believe historically was about half that of the spend share? Yes. 
So if you can dig into that a little bit, that'd be great. 
Yeah. So you, your memory is really good. 
Uh, you know, typically, we have mid 40s. Um, spend share, and we have, uh, low 20s, uh, lending share within our customers. 
You know, I think there's, there's kind of legacy point of view that our customers don't borrow on credit cards, 
but our customers tend to account for about a third of the industry billings on credit, 
and about a third of industry outstandings on credit. 
Um, and we believe that our customers, um, uh, expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products. 
And, you know, we have been growing if you look back 
2019 in the three years previous we probably grow, grew at 2x the industry rate, 
at least some, some years 3x the industry rate in terms of, uh, lending volumes. 
There was a lot of investor concern, the analysts concern at the time about 
could we do that prudently? Would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that or was there a surprise? 
Uh, a surprise looming. One of the things we've said and we remain committed to it 
is, you know, we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base, right? 
Whether that's installment capabilities, term loans, or some of the new features you've described. 
And for us, they're important because not only do customers expect them, 
but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can reinvest into highly competitive value propositions. 
So yes, we have 
put both revolve and transaction based installment capabilities on our full US consumer product stuff. So historic green, gold, platinum. 
Um, and we'll be working through a process of introducing those features, uh, to our members in the current quarters. We wanna make sure that, 
you know, we don't sound tone deaf in terms of the marketing we're doing and what new features we're introducing, 
um, but we believe customers expect that and on installment in particular, 
I'm really enthusiastic about that, right? There's a financial discipline to these closed end installment programs, 
and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting used to kind of installment and put sale type capabilities. 
Yeah. Lemme ask you about that because, 
uh, that's, it's a hot market, it's hard to understand how much it's really penetrated, uh, US 
credit, um, it seems that the barriers are lower, when it comes to an e-commerce transaction. 
For instance, 
uh, we believe that a firm will be available to every Shopify merchant at the product level, as opposed to just the checkout level, 
um, on those websites, 
so maybe you can discuss for a minute how 
you're thinking about those products, perhaps leaping in front of Amex's ability to lend to its customer because of the placement. Yeah. 
Well, I think you know, the good thing about, 
um, about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale, knowing it's available to them. And it introduces zero friction in checkout, right? Because on the back end, on their app, they can opt into a plan of three, six, 12 months in duration, with very transparent fees associated with it. 
Um, so I think, as opposed to having eng, to engage in the purchase that… but I think there are a lot of things a firm and Shopify, 
others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight, reduced friction there. 
Um, but you can't get less friction than we have in that, um, purchase experience. 
I also think it's a platform that's, um, has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with our partners, right? So if you think about our airline and hotel partners, and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it, 
um, you know, uh, on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that, 
but also to drive card acquisition saying a Delta purchase path, we think it has powerful potential. 
Okay. All right. 
Um, on the card portfolios, 
Amex has done, um, since Steve took over, Amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles, 
which has had a profound impact on the rate of growth in net card fees. Yeah. 
And so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical new customer account acquisition you expect off of a refresh, that might cause, um, a slowdown in those fees, and then a re-acceleration at some point? Yeah. 
So I think we have done a really good job of that, you know, we exited ' 19 with north of 20% card fee, uh, growth. 
Um, and you know, this year, right before the pandemic hit, 
we actually refreshed our entire Delta, uh, co-brand portfolio and priced for the value in that. 
Um, so I would say the, the pandemic has affected a couple areas. 
Um, you know, I think it's affected our acquisition bonds as I said, in Q2, we decided to focus on existing customers. 
We pulled back on acquisition, that definitely slows the flow of new fee paying, uh, customers. 
I think there may be examples where we refresh products and have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh, or whether we defer that fee increase for 
12 months. I think we're gonna have to be sensitive to the environment, but in terms of 
the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh, adding value and pricing for that value, both on the back and the front book. 
We remain committed to that. And I think you should expect that, um, regardless of the environment, 
that 2021 will feature some large scale refreshes as well. Okay. Um, 
I wanna ask you about all the work you've done to support your co-brand partners, especially in TNT. 
And do you have concern around, you know, you see some of these announcements that 
I'm not sure if they're threats, or if they're real, when a United goes out and says We're getting ready to lay off 50% of our domestic staff. Um, 
Delta has clearly not said anything like that. But 
point is, how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed? And how's Amex thinking about that? 
Yeah. Well, I mean I… fundamentally, I view them as, as under stress, as we all are, but since I do believe in the return, especially of leisure travel, 
um, on the back of a vaccine, 
I believe in the long term, uh, of those partners as well. I also happen to think we have, 
we have great partners. We have a really premium set of partners, whether it's Delta, whether it's Hilton, whether it's British Airways, who we just react with, 
um, uh, and, you know, my, my view as it was in, you 
know, the great financial crisis was, these are great times to, to lean in build partnership, 
and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base. And that's what we've done right? If you look at 
the value injections, we've done with Delta that we've done with Marriott that we've done with Hilton, and these are partners that as you say, 
they're under a fair amount of stress, and they have come to the table, uh, innovated with us co-invested to, to make those products appealing even in a travel challenge time. 
And I think you'll see, you'll see more of that in, uh, in ' 21. 
I feel, um, I feel great about the long term health of those portfolios, and I feel really good about the partners. 
Okay. We've got a minute and I really wanted to give you a chance to answer, um, 
Amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up. 
Razzie, Mezi, cake, pocket concierge, uh, lounge buddy, you know, to name a bunch, 
how is that all coming together to support your customers? Are we gonna see significant changes to the American Express 
mobile app, which I think is the best in the industry as it is, to bring those capabilities to bear? Yeah. 
It's a great, it's a great question. And it's one that's live on our minds as well. 
Um, and, you know, I mean, the most recent capability based acquisition would have been cabbage on the small business side, 
right? mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and, you know, we have been on the journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences, 
uh, like dining has always been top passionate for our customers, right? 
Um, it's, you know, we have a billion dining transactions, it's the number one request into our concierge and travel. 
And so digitizing and adding content there, um, was sort of a no brainer to us. 
But your, your point is, right. 
We have seen through the digitization of our products and servicing, a material drop in offline service. 
A large shift to online, 
and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of 35, 80% of our acquisitions happen in digital channels. 
And so that trend, plus the content we're adding, right, so you add dining, 
you add installment type capabilities, you add, you know, new SME product sets, 
you know, our mobile product and web product are gonna have to flex to make that expanded range of content easier to navigate for folks. 
There's no question but to your point, I think we feel like we started a really, uh, strong place, right in terms of, uh, our own internal assessment, as well as external recognition of, of our mobile product. mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
Well, I'm gonna have to wrap it there. Doug, I really appreciate you joining us. I really want to do this in person next time 
<laugh>. And- Next do that. E, en, en, enjoy the last fleeting days of summer. All right. 
You too Craig. Great to see you. Thank you. Thanks. Take care Doug. All right. Bye.
