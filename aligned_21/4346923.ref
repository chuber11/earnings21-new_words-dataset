It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Calle. Uh, thank you Indira, and good morning everyone. 
Uh, given the current market situation, I would like to start by giving you an update of the status of all operations today. 
The U.S region that represented last year 39% of our segment volumes 
and close to 55% of our consolidated editor, 
continues to operate under regular standards. 
Market demand behaved normally until recently when 
we started to experience a slow down in the region. So segment mainly are related to instrument dispatches from our <unk> work plant. 
On the Caribbean and Central America, we are dispatching cement from all of our facilities, except from Panama, 
that is still closed by governmental instructions. 
In most of these countries through the month continues to be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, 
with the exception of Haiti, which exceeded a satisfactory market performance. 
The Colombian quarantine was lifted on April 13th 
for the infrastructure, on April the 27th for the residential and commercial formal sector, 
allowing us to restart our operations ever since. 
At the end of April the retail segment had experienced a record of 50% on its daily volumes. 
The industrial segment on the other hand started much slower, even the highest complexity of your starting its operations. 
In light of this challenging market conditions, we have restructured and launched Preset, 
a comprehensive action plan to operate the company during the next month. Presets, 
which stands for restart safe and healthy to boost the economy, bring hope and transform lives, 
is a program that represent the company to face the pandemic and the later gradual market recovery. 
Preset tackles three dimensions, health and safety, liquidity, and operational excellence. 
The health and safety dimension was built on our I Promise 
Program to design and put in place all the health and safety protocols 
that are being implemented to protect our employees, clients, surrounding communities, and suppliers, 
to be able to operate under COVID-19 outbreaks. 
We are ready to safely restart operations in those facilities that are still closed, or that are gradually going back to regular production standards, 
while maintaining and improving the current safety protocols in countries such as the U.S and Haiti, where we have not experienced any health in production. 
The liquidity I mentioned includes, cash preservation and the construction of a new operational model, 
built with a zero-based budgeting methodology for the rest of 2020. 
To improve our cash position, Argos is based $160 million 
in short-term trade lines and consolidated all payments related decisions from its local operations to have a more efficient use of liquidity. 
As a result of these measures, 
the consolidated cash position of the company stood up at approximately 615 billion Pesos as of April the 30th. 
An amount significantly higher than the amount we held at the start of the year. 
Our neutral base budget captures efficiencies that amount between 75 to $90 million on 2020 of which 84% will be obtained from fixed costs and 16% from the GMA. 
On top of that, the company has decided to reduce $40 million in CapEx from the quarter of the year on projects that are not necessarily to operate under the existing market conditions. 
The initiatives related to operational excellence and ensuring the optimum mix of assets, products, services, manpower and logistics to redeploy according to the evolution of demand in our different markets. 
In this context, we expect a further migration towards technological tools in the future, such as Argos ONE, 
that enables our clients book contractors and ready mix dispatches through a digital platform. 
During March, Argos ONE accounted for 70%, 41% and 23% of cement dispatches of Columbia, 
the U.S and Panama respectively. 
And for 49%, 3% and 33% of the remix dispatches in these countries. 
In relation to the divestitures announced to the market on our last earnings call, 
for the $400 million, we would like to mention that after careful analysis 
the transaction has been postponed based on the uncertainty surrounding the short-term impact of COVID-19 
on the worldwide economy. 
But maintaining our commitment to carry them out as soon as the market returns to better conditions. 
We are aware of the impact that these decisions has on meritus, ratings of the company, 
and in that sense, we have been in constant discussions with both our rating agency, our 
vendors, to make sure that they fully understand and support our decisions. 
Even the strong cash position of the company, the various initiatives within reset, user 
report from our stakeholders and the passionate commitment of our more than 10,000 employees. 
We firmly believe that Argos is fully prepared to face the current market conditions to continue building dreams that promote development and transform lives. 
Now, moving to our consolidated results, I would like to start by mentioning that 
all comparison on this call will be made on the results, including IFRS-16, as 
we now have comparable figures for the present year. 
Percentage changes in ready mix, dispatches and EBITDA are calculated based on the performance numbers of 2019, 
which exclude the operations from the remix divestitures carried out in the US region between 2019 as well as the land appraisals registered in Columbia last year. 
Cement dispatches reached 3.6 million tons during the first quarter of 2020, 
decreasing 6.1% when compared to the same quarter of 2019. 
And remix dispatches reached 2.1 million cubic meters posting a 10.7% decrease on a like for like basis. 
These results were affected mainly by the lockdown measures in Colombia and some coast of Carrianas into America and to our latest expense 
to the adverse weather conditions experienced in some regions of the U.S. 
Revenues closed in 2.2 trillion Pesos with an inclusion 0.2% on a year to 
year basis, but even mainly the devaluation of the Colombian peso. 
The EBITDA, on the other hand, it is 1% on a like for like basis in line with the declining volumes experienced in both segments 
during the quarter as a result of the slow down of operation in Colombia and most of the foreign markets, in total America and the Caribbean. 
Now to start with our results in each region, I would like to invite Bill to explain the performance of the business in the U.S and our view for the market. 
Thank you, Juan, and good morning everyone. I would like to start by providing some color on our volume performance. 
Cement dispatch has posted a slight decrease of 1.2% for the quarter, 
with low single digit growth in our deep South and Florida cement districts of around 3% and 1% respectively. 
The Northeast reflected positive dynamics too, but started to face some deterioration in volumes during March due to the health crisis situation, 
mainly in our Mid-east markets. 
For the ready mix business, we experienced a 5.5% decrease on a like for 
like basis, when excluding the volume from the plants divested in December of 2019. 
This decrease is mainly due to adverse weather conditions in major markets during the quarter 
where when compared to the first quarter of 2019, 
Georgia, Dallas and Houston experienced 13, 10, and seven less operational days respectively. 
On prices, based on healthy market dynamics during the first few months of the year, we achieved an improvement in our ready-mix segment of 1.8% 
when compared to the same quarter of 2019. 
Cement prices on the other hand, stayed on similar levels to the ones observed in the same quarter of last year. 
These results are aligned with our strategy to continue improving in terms of profitability, 
always monitoring market conditions, which is going to be key during the rest of the year due to the current challenging circumstances for the construction industry and the economy as a whole. 
EBITDA on a like for like basis, decreased by 6.1%, 
affected in part by lower rating mix volumes, but mostly by higher maintenance expenses of $8.1 million for our Martinsburg and Newbury plants. 
In terms of the market, I'd like to highlight the resilience of the U.S demand during the first quarter of the year, 
despite the COVID-19 outbreaks presented throughout the country. 
Even though construction has remained an essential activity, in the near future we envision a slowdown of the residential and commercial segments, 
based on weak readings of some indicators such as unemployment, housing starts, housing permits and the architectural billings index among the others. 
On the civil and infrastructure front we foresee a short term impact due to financial constraints at a state and local governments level, which based on construction spending readings since mid 
2018 for supporting the positive dynamics theme for this segment until February 2020. 
On the midterm though, we expect a rebound based on potential stimulus measures from the government related to infrastructure, 
which would positively impact the construction sector due to its influence on employment and the multiplier effect on the economy as a whole. 
Thank you Bill, to conclude the U.S region, I would like to emphasize the fact 
that we are confident about the role that infrastructure will play on the record of the American economy. And in that sense, we expect the coordinate initiatives to be developed around that sector. 
Moving on to Columbia, I want to highlight the price improvement achieved during the first quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in the <inaudible> captures in the second half of last year, 
which led to an increase in EBITDA margin even in the scenario of lower volumes as a result of the quarantine. 
Tom will now provide additional color on this region. Thank you Juan, and good morning. 
During the quarter, we continued implementing our strategy to recover volume, which led to an increase in service of nearly 13.5% 
versus the same quarter of last year with a temporary loss of volume. 
Volumes were also affected by the quarantine including Colombia from March 25th on which cost a reduction equivalent to 8% of the business working days in the first quarter. 
Through the quarantine, we were able to continue dispatches to some essential infrastructure service such as Tunel de la Linea, <unk>, and a few mining projects, 
as well as some exports from our Cartagena plant. 
Cement from ready mix dispatches decreased 13.9% and 19.5% respectively on a yearly basis. 
In line with the price improvement our EBITDA posted a 15% growth during the quarter resulting also from lower maintenance expenses, as well as for my continued effort to renegotiate supply contracts from <inaudible> which led to an increase in the cost of energetic of 8.8% versus the same period of 2019. 
I would also like to emphasize on the EBITDA margin improvement of 4.3%, which is an important achievement in the scenario of lower volumes. 
In relation to the restarting of our operation, to the date of these call, we haven't started our mills of Cartagena, Rio Claro, Tolu and Yumbo 
as we roll out 17 of our ready mix plants across the country. 
We will adjust our operations network as required by the growth of demand always focused on implementing all the safety protocols to ensure the health of our employees, 
contractors, clients, and suppliers. 
On the demand side, we expect further improvement of the industrial segment during the month of May as construction projects will be able to fully restart their operations and have their stores, you know, become available in line with demand for construction materials. 
Our clients from the industrial segment have been able to endure the quarantine measures by implementing a strict control on their cost and therefore are ready to restart their projects. 
To the date of these report, important projects such as Tunel del Toyo, 
Pacifico one, two and three, and Ruta del Sol one, two, have already successfully restarted their cement and ready mix consumption. 
In terms of competition, during the first quarter, the market experienced a decrease in clinical and cement inputs of 45 and 56% respectively when compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Additionally, between March and April, the input price has increased 17%, due to the devaluation of the Colombian peso, which adds more space for continuing our volume recovery strategy once the market goes back to 
more normal standards. 
Thank you, Tom. I would also like to highlight the early actions taken by the Colombian government in preventing the increasing the contagion curve within the country, 
which for our French, our belief of our prompt recovery on the local economy. 
Moving on to the Caribbean and Central America, 
I would like to highlight the improvements that we saw on EBITDA margin when compared to the last quarter of last year, 
despite the fact that our two biggest operations, Panama and Honduras, were closed in the last week of the quarter due to the Corona crisis. 
Camilo will provide more information on the performance of the region. Thank you Juan, and good morning everyone. 
The first quarter of 2020 was positive in terms of market dynamics with countries like Honduras and Dominican Republic during January, February, and mid March. 
From the second week of March on, we had several affectations in demand in both countries due to the lock downs declared by local governments. 
These lock downs have been partially lifted to the date of this call. On April, we saw volumes in Honduras and Dominican Republic of around 40% of our regular month. 
Panama continued to have challenging market dynamics during the first two months of the year, that worsened on March with COVID impact on the demand and the later quarantine measures implemented by the government. 
We expect a lockdown measure for the construction sector to be lifted before mid May in accordance with public statements made by the government and in that sense, a reopening from our facility around that date. 
Haiti on the other side, continued its positive trend, improving prices in 7.1% in volumes and 11.1% versus the first quarter of 2019. 
Overall, we experienced increases in both the EBITDA 
and the EBITDA margin when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 of 5.9% and 1.2% respectively. 
Unfortunately these results were still lower than the first quarter of 2019, in part due to the quarantine measures, but mostly due to the overall market conditions. 
In Panama, and the fact that prices in Honduras continue to be lower than the average price of 2019. 
As a result, cement volumes decreased 4.1% and ready-mix volumes decreased 34.1% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. 
This lower volumes led to a decrease of 16.9% in the revenues and 33.5% on EBITDA. 
During this quarter, we continued to work on obtaining further efficiencies on energetics on our local operations. 
I. Honduras, for instance, we inaugurated a solid fuel storage in the North of the country that will allow us to receive bigger amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price. 
We also supplied, during the first quarter of the year, 11.6% of the energy from our Piedras Azules plant with the solar farm operated by Cellcio 
with lower cost together with environmental benefits. 
This initiative lowered the CO2 emissions from our energy supply in around 1500 tones during the first quarter of 2020, 
reinforcing our commitment towards sustainability. 
We believe that the second trimester of this year will continue to be challenging for the regional 
but maintain our cautious optimism on the second half of the year, due to the fact that economies such as Panama, Honduras and Puerto Rico 
took early actions on lock 
downs and quarantine measures and in that sense, we expect an early recovery in those economies. 
Thank you Camilo. I will also like to highlight the effort of the Panamanian government to protect the local economy 
by imposing a 30% tariff to the inputs of cement to the country, 
which will have a positive impact on the competitive scenario of the country. 
We expect similar other strategies to be implemented from all the governments in the Caribbean and in American regions. 
I would like to refer now to our balance statement. 
We closed the first quarter with our net debt with a ratio of four times, which is lower to the ratio of the last quarter of 2019. 
These results was driven by the fact that our dollar denominated EBITDA was proportionately higher than our dollar denominated debt. 
Improving our laborers ratio in a scenario of similar indebtedness and EBITDA. 
Regarding the commitment that we have previously made from leveraging the company and reducing our net debt toward the ratio, 
I want to reassure you that even though the current market conditions won't allow us to do that 
as soon as we were expecting, we continue to focus on the things that we solve in the mean term. 
This temporary prizes has boosted our creativity, our innovations and our savings initiatives, 
and has reinforced the commitment and for people to add Argos to the new market conditions. 
We're current to reviewing the guidance provided on our last earnings call, 
taking into account the impression and the market conditions that we are currently going through. 
We expect to have our review on our next earnings call. 
Finally, I would like to close the call by asking you all to stay safe, 
to take care of yourself and your loved ones, and to comply with all the recommendations from your local authorities on matters of social distancing. 
Thank you all for your attention. Operator, we can proceed now with the QA section. Thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to ask a question over the telephone, just press star, then one. 
Again, if you have a question, press star then one. To remove yourself from the queue, just press the pound or hash key. 
Our first question comes from Juliana Aguilar with Bancolombia. Please go ahead. 
Hi. Good morning everyone, and thanks for the call. 
I have two questions. My first one is regarding the resumption of activities in Columbia, how you're seeing this resumption 
in scenario of lower demand. Are you going to concentrate operations, operations in just a few plants? 
Uh, maybe planning on building new inventory and then shutting down the kiln? 
Any additional color you could give us will be very helpful. 
And my second question is regarding your divestment plans that you have decided to perform given market conditions. 
I feel, uh, seeing this… I just feel 
this section needs to be carried out, 
uh, this year, or you see them, you see it, uh, being executed, uh, more 2020, 2021. Thank you very much. Uh, good morning, Juliana, and thank you for, for your questions there. 
In Columbia, we have gradually start, you 
know, the operations and the reality is that not only in Colombia but in all the markets that are, you 
know, starting. We have seen better than one scenario that we were expecting. 
We have inventories of, of 17 multiple plants, um, so we're starting the supply even more inventory. 
We will then proceed with, uh, restarting our uh, grinding 
mills. Um, initially, in all of our plants will 
be having these inventories and going forward, we have foreseen that for the first two or three months maybe we will only <unk> in <unk> and Cartagena. 
But the reality is that, the project in demand we estimated is, um, way better than we expected when we restarted operations so 
we are ready to move on and start the other plants as soon as we can. 
In the second question about the divestment plans, I mean the reality that we have a levels interest for the divestment 
or administering in Texas, we have more than, uh, 12, uh, parties interested in progress and 
<unk> ways that we can <unk> so that we have more visibility on the impact, on the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. 
economy. 
Uh, <unk> it was really the third 
quarter of, of the year. 
But we are really interested in committing to executing our divestment plan to prepare the rest of 
the company to get us where we want. Okay, thank you very much. Our next question is from Paul Shaban with <unk> Investments. 
Thanks, and good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I hope that you're all safe. 
Uh, first of all I would like try to say a couple of points. Uh, I think you mentioned, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, <inaudible> of 40 million this year. 
I, I, just would like to understand is it 40 million less than last year or 40 million less than the… than the guidance that you had given in February? 
Uh, and the second point I would like to try say is on the pricing. In Colombia, I think you mentioned an increase- Paul, hi. <inaudible>. Yeah. Paul, co- 
could you, could you please speak loudly? <inaudible> everyone around here, thank you. 
Okay. So, so what I would like, uh, clarify is a couple of points, the, the first, the first point I'd like to clarify 
is on the CapEx, you mention a reduction of 40 million of CapEx in 2020. Uh, is it 
40 million less than last year or is 40 million, uh, less than the guidance that you gave in February? 
And the second point is on the pricing 
unit, in Colombia, I think you mentioned an increase, uh, of 13.5% of prices Q1 but, 
uh, you are mentioning FOB pricing. Uh, uh, are we 
I would just like to understand, are these own selling prices or are we talking about import pricing? 
Thank you for, thank you the, for the question. I mean, the CapEx result of $40 million 
is, uh, is, um, you know, with respect to our guidance not 
to last year. It's $40 million with respect to our guidance not to 
the beginning of the year. And, uh, 
I'm sorry but I didn't hear your second part of the, of your question. 
The second part of the question was about the pricing in Colombia. You mentioned an increase of 13% of FOB prices in Colombia, 
but, uh, just would like to understand, uh, whether we are talking about import prices or your own selling prices? 
If I understand you well those around pricing things in Columbia, uh, the pricing <unk> end of March, um 
the reality is that we are forseeing the possibility to continue with that pricing starting going forward starting in the third quarter of, of this 
year. Once the with <unk> a little bit it would be the 
devaulation of the colombian peso with that of the internal pricing <unk> prices has widened. So the reality 
is that, uh, <unk> opportunity to, um, to move forward this strategy 
for as we call in Colombia. 
Now <unk> in terms <unk> in Colombia <unk> prices are below $80 and the reality 
is that import prices in Colombia are closer to $110 if you take 
into 
account 
all the other markets. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our 
next question is from Gordon Lee, with BTG. Thanks. 
Hi, good morning. Uh, thank you very much for the call. I hope everybody, uh, on the call is doing well and, and, and your families as well. 
Just, uh, very quickly two questions. First on the balance sheet, 
I wa- was wondering what, uh, what the plans are for the, the refinancing or the kicking back of maturities that are on the balance sheet for 2020? 
And I guess similarly, how conversations with creditors are going on, on waiting covenants? 
And then just on the operating side, you mentioned in the release and in your remarks on the qualifying set on 
that, uh, that you were expecting other countries in the Caribbean and Central America region to, to follow Panama's lead on imposing import tariffs for cement. 
I was wondering whether that's sort of an expectation based on your reading of the markets or whether there's actual tangible comments for progress made by, by some of these markets already on this front? Thank you. 
Um, thank you Gordon. I will start by answering your difficult 
question and then I will, um, ask kindly for your comments on your our communication strategy <unk>. I mean the reality is 
that, uh, with this pandemic, we are working to increase the awareness of local governments to, 
uh, incentivize the <unk> 
in the local markets, and that means that they will pay these workers <unk>. 
We have seen that over in Panama, with <unk> and you have seeing trend in <unk> just to give you another example. Uh, so 
we have high expectations based on the trends we have seen in the region. 
Um, for the second question I would like, uh, Camilo to give you more color. 
Thanks Juan. Hi Gordon, uh, I, 
I think, everybody is sort of <inaudible> to find to start in saying that we were in… This crisis it started for us in, in March 20th 
and we have about $330 million of maturity for the rest of 2020. 
So far, 
we, we have rolled over about $115 million 
with different tenures, uh, up to, three years, uh, in some, in, in other cases, two or three months of maturity. 
We have rolled over to 100% of the, of the lots of the facilities that, that we have to enroll. Uh, 
in the And really as Juan mentioned in the, in 
the, in, in the conference regarding permanent contract with the different banks, the <unk> the support have been great of, of, of all of, of all of them. 
In the second part of the question, about the waiver, we're starting the conversations with the creditors, 
uh, on, with the creditors because we, we are requesting 
a waiver for the first, for some next quarters, 
um, really in these things… 
This is not just our, 
this is not <inaudible> that's a situation of Cementos Argos, 
this is, I believe are general situations in the market by now. 
The good thing is that, remember that in the presentation, that really we were in a very good <unk> 
net EBITDA. 
We ended March with 
very close to four times, the net EBITDA. 
Because of this prices. We are expecting to increase this level of ratio, of the ratio, 
uh, but we are very optimistic about the negotiation with our creditors. 
That's very clear. Thank you both very much and keep up. 
Okay. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. Our next question is from Adrian Puerta with JP Morgan. 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Um, I had, uh, one question on, on, uh, on the cost savings. 
If you can just provide us with more, 
um, uh, comments on, on where this fixed costs, uh that you're claiming, uh, to cut, uh, to come from? 
And, uh, and then, and then the second question that I had was, if you can just, 
uh, tell us what, uh, what happened to the price increases that you had planned, uh, in the U.S, uh, for April and, uh, and which pri- pricing rise you have executed already and, 
and, and which ones you're planning to do, um, for the rest of the year. 
Um, good morning, Adrian and, and thank you for the, for the questions. 
Um, the reality is that we have, uh, become really good at, uh, you know, of the margin at financials for the last few years. 
And with the challenges that we're facing from COVID-19 in, in our operations 
we still needs to continue, uh, accelerating saving of our operations. 
Uh, the savings will come from savings and maintenance, and services and the GMA, 
totalling, uh, close to 75 and $100 million. 
We are fully confident that we'll be able to achieve that, that target for the, the <inaudible> scenario that we are foreseeing going forward. 
Those savings will come from the U.S and from Central America, the Caribbean and, and Colombia. 
In terms of, uh, prices scenario in the U.S, I would like, uh, Bill Wagner to give you more color about that, uh, what we are seeing in the market. Yeah, 
Adrian, hey good morning. Um, yeah, as far as prices, you suggested we were looking for a price increase, uh, April. 
The reality is, that we had some good success early in a couple of markets, mainly Florida and Dallas. 
Um, you know, unfortunately given the situation rolling into the spring, we pushed out the increase that was gonna be a strong move in April, 
and we're monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see, you know, what actually we're going down with, with what's happening with the virus and the impact. 
Um, but right now we're looking at something in the, in the late second quarter maybe to, to push another price 
<inaudible>. Perfect. Thank you on that, and, <inaudible>, if I can just, uh, um, on, on, on the cost savings, 
this, uh, the, the lower cost on, on, for maintenance, are those just for, for this year 
or are those ones we see great volume would have to be, 
will have to be expense? 
You know, Adrian, this will depend on the, uh, the scenario that in, in that change. 
But, uh, we're surely confident that we will be able to earn significant savings for this year and 
for the following year, it will depend on the number of clients that we will have in operations according to the record of the month. Understood. Thank you so much. 
Thank you. And our next question is from Alexandra <unk> with Morgan Stanley. 
Hi, good morning. Thank you for the call and for taking my question. 
Uh, it's really related to, um, to what you're seeing on the ground. So you did mention that volumes in Central America and the Caribbean are about 40% of volumes of a regular month. 
So just wondering if you could add some commentary there for Columbia and the U.S of what you're seeing for April and May. 
Uh, Alexandra, thank you for, for the question. I would like Tomas Restrepo to review on our behalf. Uh, how are things evolving in Colombia 
first. Hello Alexandra, this is Tomas Restrepo. 
So in April, we, we had, uh… The, the first half of the month was, you know, pretty much a full stop, 
only, you know, a few dispatches for, uh, infrastructure projects that were, um, you know, able to continue operating. 
But by, by the end of the month we were already, uh, reaching the, the 40% of our daily dispatches. 
So April, April turned out, um, better than we thought. 
Um, basically, you know, we have dropped as much volume as we, as we expected, uh, during the quarantine. 
In the month of May, we are seeing, um, our volumes around the 50% of what they used to be, 
uh, it could be, uh, a little more, uh, and, uh, you know, to give you some 
more color about it. 
We are, we're seeing, um, you know, surprisingly, uh, a great deal of, uh, 
activity, you know, compared to what we were expecting in the retail business, 
uh, which has, you know, become so far, uh, the majority, you know, largely than even the industrial dispatches we're doing right now. 
So as, as of, uh, May the 11th when, you know, the dispatches in Bogota and many other cities and, and the whole retail stores around the country should become available and online, 
we, we are seeing, uh, you know, volumes growing. 
Um, as, I, I said, up to a little bit more than half of what we were dispatching, I think, uh, in the previous, previous months. 
And now Bill, could you provide us some color about the volumes <unk> in April which we are very pleased. Juan, thank 
you, and Alexandra, thank you for the question. 
Um, actually April was much stronger than we anticipated. Um, 
I think initially there was some forecast there we may have weakening demand towards the latter half, 
but we were certainly pleased our volumes ended very strong. 
Um, as from May, so far this month, 
uh, we're seeing another sign optimism at least for the first week. Um, our volumes are tracking pretty close to plan 
and, you know, we do see in the future that there's going to be some level of slow down, um, in the residential segment. 
I think probably to begin with, and then maybe the commercial backlog as it works off a quick slow, but at this point it's kind of hard to predict when that might occur because, you know, at this point thought we may see some slow down already, but we have not. 
Um, the impact that we've had so far has been, you know, weather related so, again, we were encouraged at, at this point 
and looking forward to see what's gonna happen the rest of this month. 
Thank you, Bill. <inaudible>. 
Camilo, can you provide us with some color about what's going on in our markets in Central America and the, the Caribbean? 
Sure Juan. Um, Alexandra, so, be, before we go into our, estimates in, in more detail, uh, Honduras, 
in 15 days of opening during April, we were able to dispatch, uh, uh, around 50% of our budget. Um, 
Panama, as we said is still close and we had some dispatches but we heard some news that the, that the economy will reopen on next week, starting with construction as one, as one of the sectors 
that reopens. 
So that's a positive, uh, new. Haiti 
is at 100% of budget and has been for, uh, for the first, uh, four months of the year and <inaudible> is still strong. 
For Dominican Republic, we did about 40% of our, of our normal dispatches 
and this was construction, um, out of a halt. 
And, uh, this was mainly between dispatches to, um, uh, people that were doing, uh, inventories for projects and other small, um, small construction. So that's part of, uh, uh, for the country. 
Puerto Rico we had, well, had a very long closure but development has a different point in time 
reopened the, um, some, uh, areas, for example small hardware stores, the initial dispatches are two days a week. 
And, uh, that's long along with exports represented about 25% of our, of the budget. 
So, uh, it was obvious that Puerto Rico will reopen the construction sector, also starting next week. 
Um, the, um, <inaudible> which had also closures in most of the islands, the budget was around 40% as well. 
And then we have <inaudible> in 84, 85% of budgets and just at 50% decline. Uh, 
French Guiana was at 105% of their budget so even though that there were measures taken by the government we did not see, uh, a decrease in demand. 
And, uh, the rest of the export markets were about, uh, 70%. 
So, uh, we assume a May now that we, that we had before April, so that's, uh, uh, encouraging news. Thanks, Juan. 
Thank you very much. This was very clear and just a quick follow up on your savings 
there, is it fair to assume that it will be proportionally split in all the countries? I mean, the $75 to $90 million, it, would it be proportional all across the U.S, Columbia and the Caribbean? Uh, yeah. 
We are expecting the, the highest savings in Columbia, followed by the U.S and then by the C.C.A, Alexandra. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from, <unk>, with Coffee Colombiana. 
Hi, everybody. The first one is related to the cement prices in Columbia, I want to know the connection <inaudible>. Hi Roberto, 
I'm sorry, but we can't listen to you. 
Can you speak louder please? Can you listen now? Can you listen now? Can you speak louder? 
Can, can you listen to me now? Yeah, its better. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you, I am sorry for that. Yes, 
I have just a few questions. The first one, can you tell me the quarterly cement price variations in Colombia? 
The second is about any market share loss that we could have in Colombia in the quarter 
due to the entrance of a new competitor? And the last one, 
uh, the 4G projects estimations in Columbia. Thank you. 
Uh, thank you, Roberto. The quarterly cement price variation in Columbia is five, 5%. 
We continue deploying, uh, with another successful strategy of leading the price recovery in the market. 
Uh, we may have lost, uh, you know, very slightly a market share in the cement business in Columbia. 
It was growing in excess of 7% during months through the end of February. And we were basically flat, 
but we were, we were very pleased with the success of our strategy of price recovery. 
Um, we will have to wait until we have, uh, more visibility in the second quarter but we are very pleased with our market position in, in Columbia. 
I don't know, Tom, would you like to add a little bit more color to the, to the answer? 
Um, well about the, the 4G project estimation, um, we're 
seeing, um, you know, all of the projects, uh, going strong, 
uh, financially solid still and, and, um, and, and we see our, you know, most of our customers very busy. 
Uh, taking care of, of their employees with, uh, with all these, you know, very demanding protocols, you know, health and safety, 
and, um, you know, we, we feel, we are still seeing, uh, 4G as a, a main driver of demand. 
Um, that's pretty much what I wanted to say about that. Perfect. 
Roberto, does that answer your question? Yes. Yes. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. In our next question, is Juan Diaz <inaudible>. 
Hi, good morning. And thank you for the presentation. I, I have two questions. 
My first question is, um, could you spend more on the construction of the net debt EBITDA plus dividends ratio, uh, in dollars? 
And what would, what would this indicator be including IFRS-16 and using adjusted to be then? What are the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year with regard to rating agencies? 
And my second question is, um, what is the medium term, uh, liquidity strategy and outlook considering that the dividend payments that should happen in the, in the second half of the year, 
were to be suppo- supported by the postponed, uh, divestitures? Uh, thank you. 
All right, thank you, Juan Carlos, would you like to answer the first one, about the debt-to- EBITDA ratio? 
Uh, thanks, Juan. But, so what, what exactly is the question? What 
I would like to know is for example in, what, 
what, what I understood in the, in the, that, uh, report from the rating agencies, they don't, uh, uh, make decision on IFRs-16 or, or, 
um… 
And, and one for that side and the other thing was on- 
Oh, thanks. No, I got it. I got it. Okay, okay. The <unk> the rating agency <unk> existing assets <unk> 
the fully IFRS 16 is really similar. 
It's pretty similar because our ratio, just taking into account the 
debt related to assets per use between us, 
divided by the depreciation, plus amortizations, plus the interest because of 
these, these leases, is right now 4 times. For the reason, including the IFRS 16, 
the ratio is really close to 4 times. 
That was the question, isn't it? Yes. And, and, and what were the strategies to lower these indicators throughout the year? 
<inaudible> now through the year 
we 
see the idea we mention 
its overly the predictability of the second quarter of the overly very complex. For that reason we are taking all these measures, like CapEx, the CapEx cut 
and the cost savings, uh, 
a lot of… All the measures in terms of the liquidity. You ask, 
well, what are we doing? 
Our current position in liquidity is about 500 and 
550, uh, 
trillion pesos, uh, you know, trillion pesos. No, no, no billion pesos. Uh, really the idea, the idea is to end 
the second quarter with about, in a, in a very special scenario, 
uh, with, uh, with about 300 trillion pesos <inaudible>. 
But it's 
very important to highlight what Juan Esteban and Tomas, Bill and Camilo mentioned that 
comparing that very speculate scenario with, 
in the reality, April was by far very nice than our initial scenarios. 
And May 
is going better by, by far as well, for the region we're expecting that we are heading to 
a better position in ter- in terms of liquidity. 
And when we, when we monitor the, the cash position of the company 
week by week going forward, uh, depending on how things work, you know, play out. We are confident that, 
as Carlos is saying, that, uh, we will be able to end the quarter with a very good cash position. Okay. 
Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Our next question is from Rodrigo Sanchez with Davivienda Corredores. Yes, 
good morning and thank you for the presentation. I, I just have two questions. 
Uh, in addition to the funds already secured out of April, Carlos covered, on what we expect on the liquidity levels, 
uh, are you expecting receive further debts increases throughout the rest of the year? 
Um, also, could you please mention the amount you too have available to secure credit lines? 
Um, my second question is, uh, I understand that the shares you own in Grupo SURA uh, are used as collateral for the credit lines you, you have in place. 
Would you be restrained to sell them or at least part of it if you, if you need it to do so? Thank you. 
For the first 
part of the, of the, for the first part the question, Rodrigo, we are, we are, we are high level of capability. 
We are disbursing tomorrow another extra $15 million. Now, <inaudible> not now but that will 
operate as, uh, insurance 
of liquidity <inaudible>. Now we don't need this extra 
liquidity but really if we start to have this extra liquidity in hands, um, we are disbursing in these extra amounts. 
This is not contemplated in the figures that we were mentioning. 
And with this new credit 
line, we really will be in a very good position of liquidity for, fo very, for, for many months. 
And Grupo SURA is a collateral on credit line? No, no, no. We, we don't have any, any collateralized 
earnings shares… Okay our next question is from Alejandro Chavela with Credit Suisse. 
Hello guys. Thanks for taking my question and uh, stay safe. 
Uh, just on competitive dynamics in Columbia, I know you already mentioned a little bit, but if you could comment a little bit with regards to the, 
to the improvement that you are seeing in import parity pricing and the sliced market share that you had in the quarter. 
Uh, could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share, or what are you seeing from, 
from the market as a whole, with, with the pricing increase that you made in the first quarter? Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Alejandro. 
Uh, the market in Columbia was behaving in a, in a very good way until the, uh, first half of, of March. 
Uh, with the, um, increase in demand of last year close to 500,000 tons plus the 
7% increase in demand through February. 
The reality is that the competitive landscape was, in my opinion, a positive… 
Um, nobody was really competing on price 
because of the huge gap 
in pricing that we have vis-a-vis import parity prices and 
the intention 
of, uh, uh, of uh, everybody to reward the cost of capital of the assets that we have in, in Colombia. Um, 
I would expect that scenario to, um, continue the same way going forward once the market start to, to recover. 
So we are extremely pleased with the, 
the rising of the market in April and in May, 
and in our opinion our competitive position has strength, uh, in this restart of the, of the economy. 
Because of the, those relationships that align with our clients on the technical, um, assistance that we provide to them, 
in our opinion, have a superior value proposition for the industrial segment of the market, 
and we're, uh, in my opinion the only cement player in Colombia 
who access directly a wider range of hybrid storage in the countries. We 
are going <unk> for more than 5,000 hybrid storage. 
So in our opinion, our value proposition will be an important asset for us going forward. 
Uh, we don't foreseen any valid continued prices no matter what scenario of the month plays out going forward. This was to 
be an 
significant gap in prices vis-a-vis import parity prices. 
Juan, I wanted to add that, uh, during this quarter, 
we gained market share with the investor business where we suffered, uh, the most by the end of, of last year. 
Uh, particularly in the ready-mix business. 
So, uh, we are, we are, uh, as strong as, as we've always been in the industrial part of the, of the market. 
Uh, the loss of market share has been, uh, mostly focused on, on the retail business, 
that is where we have seen, uh, you know, recovering prices faster, 
and we have gone, uh, as usual, faster than our competitors in, in that market. 
Um, and, uh, and I, and I think, you know, it's pretty much a, a very good move to have done it before this crisis, 
uh, because otherwise, you know, our competitors will be, uh, as Juan was saying, uh forced or, 
or, um, 
incentivized, you know, to, to, to recover, uh, value as well for their, for, for their companies in a, in a, you know, more stressful, uh, market. 
So we are, we are trying, you know, to, to recover the markets share, 
uh, with, uh, healthier prices, 
you know, as we are seeing today and, 
and, um, you know, import parity prices have been, uh, uh, a very good indicator of, 
of, uh, of, you know, the, the direction where, where national prices should go 
and in this case, uh, this is going in the, 
you know, in, in, in the, in the right direction. Understood, thank you very much. Very clear. 
Thank you. Our next question is from Stephanie <unk> with CrediCorp Capital. Good morning. 
Thank you very much for the presentation. 
I have two questions. 
Um, my first question is regarding the distribution of your taskforce. Uh, 
what proportion would you say is fixed, and what proportion would you say is variable? 
And then my second question is, uh, regarding the competitive dynamic in Honduras. 
You mentioned in the presentation that you had price decreases, so I would like to have a 
little bit more of detail in that front. Thank you, Stephanie <inaudible> for your 
question there. There is little for variable and fixed because it's more at 50 -50. 
Um, and regarding, Honduras, the reality is that we have started to see various dynamics in the market. Um, in 2020, 
January and February were very good months in terms of the month. Some things were going way better than in Honduras. 
And with the recovery of and the market, as Camilo mentioned, we may 
still, uh, we may still don't have enough visibility, um, and we need more weeks to really know what it's going to be like, uh, the normal demand in Honduras again. 
Uh, up to now we're at peace with the dynamics, 
if the market continues recording, 
uh, we foresee a scenario in which we can't start, um, uh, practical strategizing in Honduras similar to one that we are executing in, in Colombia. 
I don't know Camilo, if could react to that. Some color. 
Just to mention that, 
um, this, this was previously addressed as well, that um, the tariff is something we've been, you know, 
have discussed so that could potentially, um, benefit as well the direction of the prices in the market, 
um, and 
uh, again, starting on December following through to the, the middle of, uh, March we had a very strong, uh, 
in the country, which, which I think is, uh, is very funny. 
Because you'll see how the recovery goes and, um, what, uh, programs that the, um, the government recover to the economy, 
uh, 
but, um, definitely construction sector for a country like Honduras is, uh, is a pretty core sector to, to, uh, this part and to, uh, 
secure as part of their jobs for the country. Great. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question, its Andres Soto with Santander. 
Good morning everybody, and thank you for the presentation. 
I, I found very interesting your comments about, um, uh, significant decline of, uh, cement and clinker imports in Columbia 
this year and also the potential, the tariffs that were implemented in Panama and potentially implemented in Honduras as well. 
So I'd like to understand, uh, how much, uh, imports represents from each of those markets? 
I mean, how much, uh, importers, either cement or clinker was percentage of the Columbia in the market as of 2019? 
And if can show the same number, uh, for Panama and Honduras it will be very helpful. 
Thank you. Thank 
you, um, Andreas. Uh, importing into Colombia, uh, mainly clean care last year was up to 600,000 pounds. 
Uh, importing to Honduras and Panama, close to 8% of the market in each of those markets. 
Uh, Panama cement and, and Honduras as well on the, the cement. 
Uh, in our opinion, uh, the recent trends in our economy towards, 
uh, you know, supporting local industries, is to protect employment, 
uh, and especially in places such as Colombia, where the prices are way below import prices. 
It doesn't make any sense for the country to, uh, use foreign reserves to input clean care 
where we have, uh, enough local capacity, uh, to supply the, the industry, local integrated producers. So in our opinion, 
that is a change that will prevail going forward, Andreas. That's very helpful. 
Thank you, Juan Esteban. Thank you. Our next question is from Francisco Suarez with Scotia 
Bank. Hi, thank you for the call this morning. Um, I hope you're all do well and healthy and you loved ones. 
Uh, congrats on the nice performance on margins 
in Colombia despite the, the huge drop in volumes that tells you, uh, a little bit about what you're doing progressing there. The 
first that I have on, are on the United States first, 
what can we take commercially to be ready to be better positioned to sell more, uh, uh, cement to, and ready mix to infrastructure, uh, projects? 
And secondly, 
uh, do you think that the overall, uh, performance in densely populated regions in the United States 
might affects us more compared to all the regions within the United States? Thank you so much. 
Thank you, Franco, and thank you for your questions. 
I'm very, as well very pleased with the performance of our business in Colombia. Just to give you an idea what EBITDA margin per 
ton: in January and February it was an excess of $30 per ton of EBITDA. 
Um, the reality is that, once the months start picking up we're, um, very confident that the profits 
will increase for our business in Colombia as we continue improving in a, in a significant way. 
To answer your question about the U.S, U.S and market I would like to give to, uh, Bill the question. 
Yeah, Fransisco, thank you and good morning. 
To answer your question regarding the infrastructure, we feel like, we feel like we are very well positioned to take on more of that, uh, opportunity as it presents itself. 
Uh, we think it's gonna be much bigger going forward. 
But the, the reality is as of now, in Q1-19, we had about 5% net, represented about 5% of our volume. 
And in Q1- 2020 is representing about 8% of our volume. 
So, you know, we have been focusing on that. So we feel like we're pretty, in a pretty good situation and, and we did see some increased demand there 
to be able to take advantage of it. Okay. 
Thank you. 
Uh, so <unk>. 
Given, and given the differences in, in demand from COVID-19 from densely populated regions compared to others that are not as densely populated regions? Bill, that, that one is for you. 
I don't think that we are seeing increase 
in demand from the large metropolitan 
and densely populated regions than the more rural areas in the U.S, right? Yes, that's right. 
I think that will be a difference, uh, Juan, I think, you know, we're monitoring that as we go because the local and the state governments, you know, they kind of 
make some of their own decisions and where we are have, you know, revenue some tools and we have, 
uh, uh, things that, that help fund the highway, the gas tax and things like that, wherever, wherever there's differences there, there could be differences in demand as well. 
But we keep an eye on that by state. Yeah, thanks. Got you. 
Thank you so much. Take care. Thank you. 
And our next question is from Mike Deck with Database Analysis. 
Um, thank you very much. Um, my question is on energy costs, please. Um, they were down, I think, in Colombia 8.8% in Q1. 
What is the outlook for energy costs in Colombia, please, for the rest of the year? 
Um, secondly, in the U.S, were there any savings in energy or diesel costs of significance in Q1 
and again, what's the outlook for the rest of the year if you could? 
And then finally, on your reset initiative, 
does it include the benefits of lower energy costs expected this year, or would they be on top of the reset initiative cost savings? Thank you. 
Thank you Mark, Mike. The reality is that in Colombia, 
uh, energy price is not decreasing is not decreasing a significant way from last year. 
From the beginning of the year we are seeing them on the same level as we have the first quarter of, of the year. 
In the U.S we have seen significant, uh, savings in diesel, from, from our ready mix, uh, 
significant, um, very good, very good performance because of the, the lower part of oil. 
So in general, we are foreseeing now much better scenario in terms of energy prices in all of our regions. 
Similarly, in Central America and the Caribbean, the, all of the countries are 
oil, um, importers and pet 
coke, so the reality is, in terms of energy costs, I mean, they will be 
very favorable going forward in all of the three regions. 
If Tomas, Camilo or Bill would like to comment just a little bit more on the specifics of each region, more than welcome. 
Juan, uh, from my part, this is Tomas Restrepo, um, 
I would just like to add the impact of this, uh, energy cost reduction in, on our variable 
costs in Colombia are very significant. Today, uh, our variable costs 
per ton, including plants artificial at Cartagena and others, sealing, wet process at Yumbo. 
So our, our average, uh, variable cost in Colombia is $20. 
And it goes very, very much lower, uh, you know, it sounds like Cartagena, for example. 
So that is, that is a, a, a great effect of the, of, of the these prices 
in Colombia, we are using mostly coal, uh, today. Our, our gas is denominated in dollars, 
uh, so but, but there is a very good availability of, of coal, uh, at this moment, 
and, uh, are slightly to diversify, 
uh, our few materials with the, 
uh, the alternative fuels, it is also, also paying back as we are using, uh, cheap tires and, uh, you know, biomass and other different types of fuels 
and we're 
seeing you know, good opportunities, uh, to, to start using carbon, uh, residues converting into fuels for the, for the future. 
So, so, we are seeing a good, uh, you know, a good outlook in terms of fuels for, for this year in Columbia. 
Thank you, Tom. Juan, 
I can complement on, uh, on Honduras and Puerto Rico. 
We have, uh, <inaudible> implemented the solar, 
uh, generation field in, in Honduras, which has a significantly 
lower cost or lower <inaudible> prices of energy to the, to the local, um, energy that's available. 
So they receive significant saving, 
um, we're also, um, installing or, or putting in operation a, a solid fuel storage in the northern part of the country. 
Uh, we were, before we were buying, um, um, coke from a local supplier. 
And now we're able to bring in, 
uh, um, our ships of 30 to 40,000 tons which, uh, gives it a very good handle on negotiating prices. We're seeing prices reduced, uh, by 10, 10 to $15 per ton 
so that's gonna have also a positive, uh, impact on the cost of the operation. 
And in Puerto Rico, we had negotiated, uh, coal last year, which was much directly with the prices that we, we, had before, 
but we expect to, to have, of course, better pricing due to the, uh, fields, uh, on the commodity prices decline in the future for the operation. 
Uh, and we're also looking at, uh, uh, implementing or, 
or looking at different solutions for, for energy in countries which we still have high costs, such as Honduras and Puerto 
Rico. Because other, other countries such as, uh, Panama and Dominican Republic, we have a very competitive, 
um, construction negotiated with local energy suppliers. Thank you, 
Juan. Thank 
you, Mike. Thank you, Camilo. Juan, just a compliment on what you said for the US standpoint, with, with respect to diesel. I mean, we have seen some movements, um, at the competition in our ready mix business. 
But again, I think you're correct, we feel like we're gonna see more of that as the year goes on, because of what's happening 
with the, the whole situation in general. 
Thank you, Bill. Thank you for that. Can I just then follow up, if all those savings, uh, from all those fuel savings you've talked about, are they in the reset numbers? Or are they on top of the reset numbers? 
They will be on top of the reset, uh, numbers. 
Okay. Uh, this was also variable cost and we are basically, um, addressing fixed costs and topics. 
Excellent. Thank you very much and stay safe. Thank you. 
And our last question is Juan <inaudible> with <unk>. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning. Thank you. And could you provide, uh, could you provide us with an overview for the working capital requirements of the business? 
We saw an increase in, in inventories and, and receivables. So, can you tell us how these, these accounts are, are behaving? Thank you. 
Thank you, Juan. Thank you for your question. 
Carlos, uh, can you, uh, give 
us some clue about the working capital management? Hi, Juan. 
The working capital… The behavior of the working capital 
so far from the beginning of the cycle has been very good. We are controlling 
almost a big level of of the organization, 
the 
excom, we are controlling almost every, every one of the <unk> of the, of the purchase orders. 
I think that that's necessary in a situation like this one, 
um, but jus- jus- just to give you a little bit more color: 
in the case of the Colombia, like Tomas has said very well, 
uh, we had stopped the operations from the, from the last 10 days of March. 
That, we had collected about 90 million pesos, 
more than 90 million pesos during April, not, not selling, 
but we are, we are, we are collecting the receivables. 
And we are as well foreseeing to rise a plan in order to reduce the level of the inventory, you know, roughly three, three regions 
and that is going well as well. Uh for 
that reason, the idea is to have a, a real effect and strict control in the, in all of the three lines of the working capital. 
And we consider that we have the, we have, we have structured a very good plans in all of the three regions, yes. Okay, thank you. Welcome. 
Thank you, and I'm not showing any further questions in the queue 
sir. So once again, thanks a lot 
for, uh, connecting to our conference call today, and stay safe. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in our next conference call. 
Have a great day. 
And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our program for today. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.
