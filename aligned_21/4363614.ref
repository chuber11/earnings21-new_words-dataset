Uh, thank you, Hector. Good morning, everyone and good afternoon to those in Europe. 
Thank you for joining our earnings call today. I hope, uh, you and your families are healthy and safe. 
As we discussed last quarter, mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the health and the well-being of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority. 
Before giving you an update on the measures that we implemented in this regard, let me begin a review by providing context. 
<inaudible> this quarter 
has been uh, quite challenging, as we are <inaudible> the impact of the pandemic on the Mexican economy, on our business, and of course, on our results. 
Despite the impact, let me assure you that our bank remains a strong and focused. 
First, our capital <inaudible> levels are solid and well above the minimum <inaudible> levels. 
Second, we have a clear study, which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact on the pandemic 
on the finances. And, third, we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution. 
Business volumes closed the second quarter with high single digit <inaudible> 
growth, for we experienced an adverse shift in our portfolio mixed cohorts, lower in <inaudible> segments. 
Consumer and <inaudible> loans started to contract in line with market trends, where the commercial and <inaudible> loans were resilient and continued to raise their <inaudible>. 
The <inaudible> measures implemented by Bank of Mexico and the CMPP 
how allow us to maintain <inaudible> levels of <inaudible> enabling 
us to for our customers support mechanisms to temporarily alleviate their cash flow and the financial distress caused by economic fallout of the pandemic. 
Although it is quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter, we made preemptive loan <inaudible> contributions 
of 3.9 billion pesos in addition to the normal quarterly provisions 
in preparation for our future losses. 
We would revise this amount every, in the future, as more information becomes available on the performance of our loan for portfolio to <inaudible> in the coming quarters. 
As we normally do, we will provide a loan review of our business environment <inaudible> our convictions that <inaudible> Mexico is very well positioned again according to <inaudible> economy impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
In slide four, we'll present select economic indicators that show the magnitude of impact of the pandemic and starting economic activity and <inaudible> unemployment. 
As you might recall, 2020 <inaudible> growth expectations for the Mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic, mainly due to weak <inaudible> profits. We 
<inaudible> indicators showing a contraction of more than 20% <inaudible> during economic activity and 37% 
on year end year and dropping fix investment. 
Market <inaudible> expectation have been revised down to a line, 9% under decrease in GDP during 
220, 2000 and 20. 
For <inaudible> this will be an economic contraction not seen in many decades. 
This significant fall in economic activity was resulted in the loss of more than one million former jobs from the second quarter. 
According to social security data, not as many as 20 million jobs lost <inaudible> employment. 
Following the past <inaudible> year economic crisis back in 95 and 2000 
and 9, it took seven quarters for the Mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity. 
However, in the current one, you can see that it is unlikely that economy could recover in within a similar period of time 
given the depth and the magnitude of the global economic shock and the absence of any meaning, meaningful fiscal problem to avoid distribute contraction in, in its employment. 
With external demand <inaudible> only <inaudible> and without any mechanism to <inaudible> rate households' income loss 
and not an economy like Mexico <inaudible> is long path to recover <inaudible> to previous activity levels. 
With 2021 growth profits being forecasted at only 3% it 
could take three to four years to recover 2019's levels of activity. 
Under these conditions, inflation pressures should remain low. We expect 3.6 for 2020, 
allowing Bank of Mexico to quote interest rates <inaudible> further. 
We expect another 100 <inaudible> of <inaudible> through the year, throughout the year, which would take the reference rate around 4% by year end. 
In summary, in this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for Mexico's commercial <inaudible> and consumer environments and for our business. 
If you turn to slide to slide five, you will notice that despite a severe shock to economic activity and employment, 
the system's loans and deposit values is to show a significant year over years expansion of 8% and 14% respectively. 
This is mainly explained 
by large and medium size companies along with entities that have drawn on the credit lines to <inaudible> ignore <inaudible> continue operating during the months of which 
the stay-at-home guidelines have been in effect. 
On the other hand, consumer loans… 
Sold a relative contraction, reflecting the in, initial impact of the pandemic on consumer behavior and is starting to <inaudible> practice as seen and maintained by <inaudible> institutions. 
It is worth noting that system <inaudible> demand deposits were made strong, up 18 in, up 18% year and year, likely reflecting high <inaudible> needs for equality among households and companies for the stay-at-home guidance remaining in effect. 
Please turn to slide six. Oh, we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months. 
Our health and business continue to, continuing to protocols remain in place, 
such as suspending non-essential travel, limiting the number of people are gathering and group events, and enhanced sanititate, sanit, sanitization measures at branches, corporate offices, ATMs, 
and contact centers. 
Essentially, most corporate employees continue working from home, while <inaudible> essential personnel are working on site. 
Approximately 80% of the bank branches are open and 92% of our ATM locations are functioning normally. 
The bank <inaudible> channels and contact centers have also been operating normally. 
Our <inaudible> transactions increase 
64% year and year, while our <inaudible> sales represented 40% of total sales. 
<inaudible> as it did last year, as we continue promoting customer's use of <inaudible> channels, which continues to drive adoption values. 
Further, more active resources have been channeled into implementing additional remote operating tools with <inaudible> security being a priority. 
During this critical time, we have been supporting our customers through our active relief program, offering deferred payments for individuals and <inaudible> and case by case <inaudible> to our corporate customers. 
I will allow <inaudible> this program being in a moment. 
As part of our commitment to our communities, we have made numerous donations and supported initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations. 
We also donated a map to the Mexico City government which allows a population to self diagnose dates of 
symptoms, locate medical facilities with <inaudible> capacity near them, and obtain information on the pandemic. 
On slide seven, you will find a snapshot of our <inaudible> support program that I mentioned before. 
Currently, 19% of our <inaudible> loan portfolio is under the payment holiday program for individual and SMEs. 
With more than 600 thousand customers benefiting from it. 
Through this program, we are helping customers who have encountered <inaudible> programs 
by permitting them to escape loan payment, both interest and principal, for four months without any penalty or cost. 
Because of this, this feature under the program, it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic's impact on our asset quality. 
However, we have been proactive in addressing asset quality over the past two months by contacting the customers to better understand their financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay. 
More than 55% of our branch network personal <inaudible> recoveries, calling customers <inaudible>. 
Likewise, the collections of commercial and <inaudible> departments <inaudible> portfolio by level of concern, 
identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality. 
Through this more granular process, we are <inaudible> each typ of client within 36 different cluster, 
which have also been analyzing our customer behavioral patterns using our <inaudible> capabilities. 
I know that more of 95% of our payroll customers continue to receive their salaries. 
For those payroll customers who are not longer receiving their salary, we are collecting for unemployment insurance. 
With current information, we estimate that close to 40% of our customers should be able to continue honor in fully the condition of their loans. 
Seen it, s, since, uh, since it is for, uh, still unclear 
if the rest will be able to remain current, we're are offering, offering loan restructurings to many of them in order to speed up the recovery process. 
It will not be until the third and fourth quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio. 
With regard to our commercial book, we are taking a case by case approach to manage our exposure. 
As we've been doing the past critical periods, we have remained very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment. 
For those companies that face difficulties, we have been offering multiple opportunities to support them. 
Our current portfolio of commercial restructure loans is close to 50 billion pesos 
and accounts for 16% of our loan portfolio with million of large sized corpa, corporates. 
In addition to actively managing our portfolio, know that 76% of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with mortgages and SMEs, which both have warranties. 
Within out total listing <inaudible> book, 67% of the portfolio is backed up by warranties issued by <inaudible>, part of Mexico development banks, 
which allow those to share the risk with them. Specifically, for those that <inaudible> during the Rivera program, 75% of them have warranties. 
Furthermore, payrolls and outer loans, 9% of <inaudible> portfolio are semi-secured, even <inaudible> percented by each customer salary and card. 
Please turn to slide eight, for 
I would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our remote support, emergent portfolio, which is giving us relative comfort to, to its defensive nature. 
Our organic port, eh, m, mortgage portfolio accounts for 86% of all our mortgages. 
<inaudible> portfolio has a loan to value ratio of 44%. 
<inaudible> has an LTB of 70% providing <inaudible> warranty coverage. 
The MPL ratio of this portfolio is 3.6% and has been quite stable for some time. 
For the past two years, our <inaudible> mortgage has allow us to attract higher income customers which are more defensive in the current environment. 
To respond to this point, our average ticket has been increasing since our lunch, 
since our launch of problem and is currently not only the highest among our peers, but 30, 37% higher than the average <inaudible> of our peers. 
In addition, <inaudible> up close customers are loyal, as they also have their payroll and their credit cards with us. 
Having a low loan-to-value ratios as well as being the main bank of our customers lowers the probability of nonpayment, 
as this type of customer tends to prioritize their home mortgages in economic downturns. 
<inaudible>, considering 
the level of warranties we have, the structure for our portfolio and the proactive measures we are taking, 
we can see that we are on the right path to mitigate the <inaudible> impact of the pandemic and the quality of a loan portfolio. 
On a slide nine, let me comment on our <inaudible> dynamics and the <inaudible> we have seen during the past few months. Commercial loans continue to support <inaudible>. 
Therefore, their contribution within local loan <inaudible> increase from 78% from the second quarter of 19 
to 82% in the second quarter in 2020. 
In <inaudible>, commercial loans now represent 64% of our total loans. 
These changes makes have had an impact on our NII, as will be explained later in the call. 
In terms of organization dynamics, we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that are worth noting here. 
In the mortgage and commercial segments, there's loan <inaudible> right <inaudible> relevance sequentially proven compared to May, surpassing January's 2020 level. 
In consumer loans, June loan renigation remains 25% below the first quarter in 20, monthly average, 
however it expanded 33% upon the 2020 minimum rates <inaudible> April. 
As you can see on slide 10, our capital <inaudible> positions are very strong. 
At the end of June, our common equity peer one, CEP1, ratio, is <inaudible> 11.6%. 
58 basis points above March and as significantly in excess of the 8.2 minimum requirement established for the bank's <inaudible>. 
<inaudible> during April shareholder's meeting to postpone the dividend payment for 2019 have allow us to further strength our capital position. 
In terms of liquidity, our 
second quarter in 2020 liquidity to coverage ratio reached 211%, 
well above the bank's, the bank <unk> requirement, and supported by senior notes, we should back in April. 
Before turning the call over to <inaudible>, I would like to finish my remarks by reiterating that we have been acting safely and decidedly to further strengthen our bank. 
In order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations, in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and customers. 
We have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and the <inaudible> channels. 
Again, we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support the customers as they recover from this unprecedented crisis. 
Now, let me pass hold, uh, the call over to <inaudible> who will review the quarter's most important trends and metrics. Thank you. 
Thank you Hector. Good day, everybody. Please turn to slide eleven for an overview for recent loan performance. 
Total loans expanded 7% year to year, but contracting, contracted 3% sequentially. Given strong corporate loan demand at the end of the first state quarter. 
Loan margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments. 
<inaudible> and current <inaudible> contracted 9% and 6% year to year, respectively. Due to economics, eh, to the economy's weak performance. 
By contrast, mortgage loans increased a solid 9% year to year and expanded 13 per, percent, when excluding the runoff effect of uh, GE and ING portfolio, which was well above market growth. 
High margin segments have reduced their contribution to <inaudible> income by almost 100 basis points. 
Individual loans on slide 12 show a slow down, growing 4% on a year to year basis, mainly supported by mortgages. 
As mentioned previously, mortgages have proved to be the <inaudible> segment within the Mexican market during the past periods of economic instability. 
With this in mind, we decided to lower even more the rate of our <inaudible> plus product to 7.75%, targeting loyal customers. 
As of June, close to 60% of our mortgage <inaudible> was coming from the <inaudible> plus, which allows to increase cross selling of other products. 
In July, we launched a new product, a new mortgage product called <inaudible> which is the first commission free mortgage product in Mexico. 
Unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee, monthly commission for a home appraisal, 
nor are life and unemployment insurance required, 
leaving only notary fees to be paid by the customer when incurring this product. 
As you can see, even during this challenging times, we haven't stopped innovating. 
There continues to be a downward trending credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment. 
In addition to matching a customer's credit limits, credit card usage declined 30% year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home. 
This drop had a negative impact on balances, of course. 
After usage, rates reach a very low level in April. They recover in May and June of the remaining slide <inaudible> below first quarter levels. 
<inaudible> our consumer loans have been concentrated in payroll loans, growing 2.5% year to year and are still above the market for <inaudible> data as of the end of May. 
Personal loans continue to contract, consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as Hector noted. 
Finally, our other loan production in June more than doubled compared to previous quarter's average, boosted by our new commercial alliance with NASDAQ. 
Turning to slide 13, closing our base of loyalty, <inaudible> customers continues demonstrating important progress. 
With year and year increases of almost 17% and 31% respectively despite a challenging business environment. 
Loyalty penetration, that is loyal to active customers to stands at 35%, 400 points higher than a year ago. 
We have seen continuous growth in the use for digital channels as customers have stayed home during the pandemic. 
This quarter, product sales on digital channels accounted for 44% of the total, almost doubling year ago levels. 
Digital monetary transactions also spiked, reaching almost one third of the total, 
while mobile transactions represented 93% of total deed of transactions versus 84% in 2019. 
While our customers also kept growing at a solid 38% year and year rate, reaching 4.3 million at the end of the quarter. 
As you can see on slide 14, commercial loans grew 9% year and year but decrease sequentially as some corporates started prepaying some lines withdrawn 
in the first quarter of the year. 
Government and middle market segments continue to register double digits year and year expansion, although their sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively. 
<inaudible> loans register up towards sequential quarterly contraction, and <inaudible> segment showed a weakening trend even for the pandemic. 
Outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the fourth quarter of 2017, ten quarters ago. 
The downward trend is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in <inaudible> segment. 
Given that more than 50% of our SME loan <inaudible> during the payment holiday <inaudible> program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program. 
Loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have ore visibility on the performance of the economy. 
Moving on total deposits on the slide 15, this increased 10% year and year while quarter and quarter we saw a 3% contraction. 
<inaudible> there was a shift between demand and time to process favor by lower interest rates. 
As of the, the, second quarter of this year, demand deposits represented 64% of total deposits and were up 11% year and year. 
Deposit grows from individual stance eh, turns out at 23% year and year, 
supported by a promotion campaign to attract these types of deposits. 
After an untypical first quarter of this year, deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits, in line with out strategy to further increase our expose to retail deposits. 
Retail deposit now represents 30, 33% of total deposits, almost 400 basis points higher than its contribution in the first quarter of 2018. 
Turning to slide 16, we have a very strong capital and liquidity positions as Hector has highlighted. 
We maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to the <inaudible> of 91.85, one of the strongest levels since becoming a listed company. 
Our liquidity rates are increased 89 percentage points relative to the first quarter of this 
year, and now spans a 211%, well above the regulatory threshold of 100%. 
We also remain very comfortable with our debt profile, with manageable debt maturities. 
Regarding capitalization, our ratio increased 46 basis points sequentially to 16.7% 
reflecting the postponement of the dividend payments as recommended by the banking commission. 
Well, our core tier one ratio was up 58 basis points to 11.6% 
and, and our tier one ratio stood at 13.03%. 
As you can see on a slide 17, net interest income decreased 4% year on year and 6% quarter on quarter. 
As a result, net interest margin contract at 128 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. 
Our margin decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances 
within the high yielding segments coupled with higher average assets as a consequence of significant increase in our security's portfolio. 
Without this last effect, eh, our NIM would have contracted only 54 basis points. 
As Hector explained earlier, we're expecting net interest income to continue contracting dur- during the remainder, eh, remainder of the year. 
Due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix, 
where growth would likely come from low yielding segments and with unlikely contraction with high yielding segments. 
However, this downward pressure will be partially mitigated by our expanded investment and security portfolio. 
Please move on to slide 18. Net commissions and fees decreased 2.1% year on year, affected by the double digit decline in credit card transactions. 
Credit card usage decreased 42% in April, 34% in May, and 14% in June on a year on year basis. 
Insurances register only a slight contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for software insurance demand. 
Insurance represents almost 30% of our total fees and have proven to be a defensive segment, even considering the, the, the pandemic. 
With health and life insurance growing, while retail insurance is slightly decreasing. 
Our investment banking team have been very active mainly in financial advisory services, which translated into strong fee growth of 31% in this line, eh, of our business, 
which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas, mainly credit card fees. 
Turning to slide 19, gross operating income grew 9% year 
on year driven by a solid performance in market related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between 
600 to 800 million pesos per quarter. 
The current interest rates, um, the FX market volatility, especially during A- April and May supported market-making income. 
In addition, we sold investment in securities in order to, for the strengthening our liquidity position generating non-recurring gains that boosted this quarter's result. 
All this contributed for market-related income that accounted for 13.8% of gross of, uh, revenue, 
3.5 times higher than historical average of 4%. 
Moving on to provisions on slide 20, in light of the deterioration of Mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of our loan portfolio, 
both due to the pandemic, 
in June we register a special charge of low loans provisions on top of those normally require. 
The 3.9 billion pesos charge raised total provisions to 8.35 billion pesos in the quarter, 
up 88% year on year and 62% sequentially. 
We have made this estimate of preemptive provisions with information currently at hand. 
However, this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available. 
Cost of risk for the quarter stood at 3.1%, a 44 basis point year on year increase, and 49 basis points sequentially. 
Our total NPL ratio showed a slight 28 basis points year over year increase to 2.5% mainly due to the SME segment 
together with our mortgage and credit card portfolios. 
As explained earlier, these ratios only reflect the performance of 81% of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program. 
We consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in, in economic activity and employment. 
However, it will not be until the third and fourth quarter of this years, of this year that the debtors pro- program will end. 
It will be at that time when NPL ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic. 
Now, please turn to slide 21. 
Administrative and promotional expenses increase 1.2% year on year reflecting the e- the effort to control personal costs, 
mainly reserves for viable compensation and amortization expenses related to the strategic and IT investments that we made over the past thr- three years. 
As we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and in technology operates, 
we're targeting grading operating efficiencies in the common quarters, such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips, 
viable compensation, as well as limiting base salary increases among other improvements. 
Less business travel and salary caps would greatly led to a sequential 1.9% decrease in our total expenses during the second quarter of this year. 
Such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our 
three-year investment plan contributed to a 358 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio, 
which decreased to 40.7%. 
On a six months, eh, basis, the ratio improved 227 basis points year on year to 42.3%. 
Turning to profitability on the slide 22, you will note that our earnings were mainly impacted by special loaners provisions that we discussed earlier. 
Profit before taxes was down 24% year on year for the quarter, and 11% for the first half of the year. 
Net income decreased 25% year on year to 4.2 billion pesos 
while our effective tax rate increase 38 basis points year on year to 25.3%. 
This resulted in an 11.5% decrease in net income for the first six months, six months of 2020 
which was 9.6 billion pesos. 
Return on, on equity was 11.9%, 543 basis points below the year ago 
level, and down 362 basis points sequentially. 
Year to date ROE contracted 328 basis points to 13.5%. 
Let me now turn the call back to Hector Grisi for some final remarks. Hector, please go ahead. 
Thank you, Didier. Okay, please, uh, turn to slide 23. 
Let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead. 
Given the unprecedented nature of these health crisis and uncertainty surrounding this duration and magnitude, we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of the economy 
which has obvious implications with regard to our operating environment. 
We expect our loan portfolio will likely be driven by commercial loans, mainly medium and large corporates, government loans as well as mortgages. 
The consumer board recover very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the rental turnaround in employment, economic activity, as well as business and consumer confidence. 
Although visibility and asset quality is limited, 
due to the payment holiday program which have been talking, um, and taking rapid and decisive action 
in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book. 
Our recoveries plan which includes a very detailed and in deep analysis of each customer's situation 
is allowing us to preemptively and swiftly, uh, prepare the bank for complicated quarters ahead. 
In particular, we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out the recovery strategy. 
We will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and on cross-selling non-credit products to support non-interest income. 
We also remain committed in, to making additional investments in the bank transformation 
mainly in IT and digitalization, but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines 
with the strict cost control in order to support the bottom line. 
And finally, rest assured 
that our banks is operating from a position of strength with robust capital, and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated, but what we believe are temporary circumstances. 
We are now ready to tackle questions. Please operator, let's go ahead. 
Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. 
If you're using a speaker phone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. 
Again, press star one to ask a question, please ask one question and a follow-up. If you have further questions, please re-enter the queue. 
We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. Thank you. 
Our first question is from the line of Jason Mollin from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. 
Hi, thank you very much. 
Uh, my question is on the operating outlook. Um, the disclosure is excellent. It's, it's always been. I like the way you presented it. 
Um, on slide 19, we, 
we can look at the, the main, um, the main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you, 
you talked about market related revenue was very strong, well above, uh, historical levels, about 14% of the total operating income compared to, let's say, three or 4% in the past. 
Uh, these are different times, but how should we think about efficiency going forward? You talked about cost control, we saw that. 
Um, if you can just give us, um, a general sense, you, you mention, uh, you, there are certain costs your, you can control and you are controlling, 
can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure? Is there a- an opportunity to rationalize physical branch network, 
um, after the investments you, you made? 
Um, what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward? 
The, the dynamic is, is quite skewed from all of these moving parts. The very high trading, um, and, and the low, the low revenues given what's going on. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Look I mean, I did not set, I mean, uh, and if you take a look at our numbers basically, we have, uh, decreased, uh, the operation cost of the bank quite significantly. 
I mean first of all, I mean not traveling and not, uh, doing many things basically have reduced naturally 
the cost. But we have also been very strict in the, in new projects and new situations. 
I mean, we are basically focusing all our expenses in IT to support the backbone and to be ready for what's coming. 
Um, so in that sense, that's one of your priority. 
Secondly, we are taking a look, uh, uh, 
and we're doing a deep dive in terms of, uh, all our infrastructure and, um, we're not gonna get, take, I mean, um, wrong decisions in terms of closing down a big number of, 
uh, of, um, branches or anything like that. I think, we're going to be rationally looking at each of the micro-markets that we have divided the country into, 
and we will decide, um, with evolution of the economy, what should happen there. 
So, uh, but we're going to be very strict. 
If you have seen the growth of the past, uh, four or five years in terms of branches, we actually have decreased the number of total branches. 
We have just, uh, we have been very intelligent in the way we have managed that. What we have done is upgraded, uh, the current and the most important branches, 
which we are going to basically 
be, uh, taking a little bit more time than the time that we, uh, were thinking of, of, um, upgrading all the branches that are not up to the standard. 
So, this is actually what we're doing. We're going to basically rationalize all, uh, all, uh, all expending 
and do it on where the most important thing is, that is basically the IT platform and the digitalization of the bank. 
So, in that sense we're going to be very concentrated on that. 
Uh, we also believe that, I mean, given that we have been able to operate 
the bank under these circumstances, we have a huge amount of people basically working from home, 
uh, you basically get to understand just actually how really, how much people do you need? Uh, what can you rationalize, et 
cetera? So, what you're going to see from us is that we're going to be very, uh, responsible in the way we manage that and, uh, concentrate on those points. We are working currently on that plan. 
We are working on our three-year plan, and, uh, and, uh, we're basically including all these, uh, inward solution. Maybe, uh, 
as a follow up. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Just some comments on what you'd seen, uh, throughout your peers and the Santander group in, in the region or elsewhere, 
are there other things you think that could be applied to Mexico that could help, 
um, perhaps on the side of the banking system? Perhaps, in terms operationally or IT, or, or any factors at all? 
Thank you. Wh- what we're doing basically is, for example, I mean in terms of developing, uh, these, the platforms, et cetera, but we're doing it, 
we're doing it, uh, now instead of each country basically developing the platforms, we are doing it, uh, together. 
So, that basically is going to help out quite a lot. 
So, uh, it's not Mexico, for example, right now in Mexico we're developing the new super app 
and the new super app is going to be used in the, in, in, in, in all the other countries, you know. 
For example, the onboarding, uh, for SMEs, we are using the one that is being developed at the, in Europe. 
So, all those type, type of things are going to help us out 
basically in reducing our cost, uh, for the, the infrastructure that we're developing and we're working together much more within the group in order to do that. 
So, you're going to see that, I mean, in the cost 
of, uh, basically developing things and it's going to come down due to the fact that we're doing it together with the rest of our, uh, um, sister banks, 
so… So, so those t- Great. Thank you very much. <crosstalk> implementing at this ti- at this point. 
Thank you. I appreciate it. You're welcome too. 
The next question comes from the line of Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning everyone. Um, I, 
I wondered what's about net interest margin. Um, you, you, you pointed out that you expect further, 
um, complications in the next couple of quarters given, uh, falling grades and weak, uh, loan demands, and, um, mixed deterioration. 
Um, as, as you look at 2021, uh, in the context of what you said on n- not a strong economic recovery next year, 
and with average rates next year being m- m- much lower than 2020, if, if indeed rates end up at 4%. And w- 
what is the expectation for the net interest margin next year, and for NII? 
I- i- is it possible that we're likely to see another year of, um, NII compression? 
And, and, to, to what extent that can be offset, uh, elsewhere in the PML? 
And, and my second question is on, um, the, on the coverage ratio. And I, and I know that banks, 
you, you know, the, the banks normally don't target a coverage ratio, I get it. 
Um, but, but evidently the, the, the size of your reserves, 
uh, have a relationship to the size of your logbook, the size of your MPLs, and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring. 
Um, and so when I look at your CapEX ratio at 100, 138%, 
it looks low relative to where Banorte ended up at 201%, and <unk> 185%. 
So I, I wonder, you know, why, why, w- w- why not just, you know, take a much bigger charge on provisions this quarter? 
Um, you know, evidently there is, there's, there's a lot of uncertainty ahead and, um, the more the better, 
a- and, and so is this piecemeal just going to, you know, potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather just, you know, take a really big one 
swoop and, you know, 
r- raise your coverage to north of 200%. 
Um, and, and is that likely maybe something you will do in the third quarter? Thank you. Um, look, Jorge. 
I will ask, um, this is Hector. I will ask, um, I will answer the first part, and then I will ask Didier to complete on the, on the basic numbers of NII, okay? Um, 
I mean, first of all, I mean, if, if you saw the presentation, we are basically changing the mix of, um, of the credit loan portfolio, okay? 
First of all, I mean, um, if you have seen, 
I mean, uh, we have decreased quite a lot our exposure, unfortunately, to SMEs given the lack of, uh, warranties from the government, from Nafinsa, 
okay? So, uh, the portfolio has dropped almost 10%. 
So, in that sense, 
uh, that basically is a high-yield portfolio, which, 
um, is going to continue to shrink unless we, we see some warranties from the government. And you, if you see our portfolio, which is quite important, 
we have like 62% of it already warranted by Nafinsa, okay? 
The corresponding volume. 
This basically goes to answer your second part of the question in terms of, uh, the amount of, uh, the amount of reserves that we have done. 
Uh, then you see that, 
uh, also, we see that, for example, consumer credit and, uh, consumer loans are going to decrease as 
well. So, the mix is completely changing. That we're going, 
the… I mean, we're going basically back to where we were, wh- where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporates 
and to medium-sized companies than to consumer loans. Remember that we have that different mix, okay? 
So, that's why NII is shrinking. 
On the other side, what we've also been doing, it was with pricing, and we are very s- strict on pricing risk, 
okay? So, um, we've been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact, 
you know, that we are basically looking at the, the risk that we are taking 
and, uh, we are looking very closely at the ratings of those companies, and we are pricing risk accordingly, 
okay? This is not a situation in which we want to spend the port- credit portfolio just to expand it. 
We are basically doing it 
just to the companies that we believe that have a future, and that will be there in the next few years, and both we're pricing the risk accordingly. 
So, in that sense, you're going to see us going towards that. 
Also, the other concentration is mortgages, 
which we, uh, which we believe, I mean, there is a sector still, uh, of growth. I mean, as you know, there is a lack of 
a, or, or a big deficit in terms of homes in Mexico. So, we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford a mortgage. 
Uh, mortgages penetration in Mexico was quite low versus the rest 
and also loan penetration is quite low. So, we believe there is a chance to, to, to continue to penetrate 
that sector. And maybe on payrolls, on some situations, we will basically be, uh, also lending in that, in the, in that part. 
I mean, and auto loans also, we have seen some interesting, uh, development there with very cautious approach to it. 
So, in that sense, the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably Didier can let you know exactly how do we see NII evolving. 
In terms of what you were asking in terms of, um, the reserves, 
uh, 
we, maybe, we've actually been doing reserves accordingly wh- to what we believe we are doing, uh, in terms of, uh, uh, how the portfolio is, 
uh, is, uh, behaving at this point. 
What I can tell you is that the portfolio not on payments holidays is behaving much, much better than we believed 
that it was going to t- that it was going to turn. 
Actually, I'm quite surprised about it. Hopefully, uh, it continues that way. 
But in that sense, we are basically being- in my opinion, uh, being very responsible in the amount of, 
uh, of reserves that we are making at this point. 
Also, we have done a tremendous job, uh, with the data, 
uh, hopes that we have in reviewing, um, the portfolio on holidays. 
And that portfolio is being divided, as we said, in 36 clusters, okay? 
These clusters have been divided upon ri- upon the amount of risk that we have on each particular situation. 
And in some of these portfolios, uh, even before the payment holiday ends, we are already talking to clients 
and discussing the way, uh, uh, that, that we could get paid on those particular situations 
because what we believe is that whoever gets paid first is the one that, is the one that is going to get paid. 
So, we are basically being very aggressive on that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that and to recover the portfolio. 
As you have seen, 55% of our branches have been turned into, uh, collecting branches. 
I mean, uh, to basically this, uh, uh, we're dedicating our executives to collect. 
We have divided them up in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are, the ones that are going to be much more important 
in that, or that are going to be hit the most in the economy. 
So, in that sense, I believe we're very well prepared. 
Although, I mean, or nevertheless, 
uh, is always, I mean, a lot of uncertainty in what's happening, and we didn't want to go overboard and we believe it's the right, uh, the right approach is the one that we have made. 
But we will continue to see over the next few months evolution. What I can tell you is that we're going to be very conservative in the way we manage that, okay? Um, Didier, 
I don't know if you want to complete. Absolutely, eh, absolutely, Hector. I would like to, to complement on what you mentioned. Eh, eh, great talking to you, Jorge. Long time, no speak. 
Um, eh, in terms of, uh, eh, NIMs, you know, eh, definitely, you know, as we laid out in the presentation, 
we see significant, uh, pressures. And let me just give you some background information that I think it's, it's, eh, it's quite relevant. 
Um, the, the speed at which interest rates have come down in Mexico is, is, is, is significant. 
You know, just in this quarter, eh, the average of the reference, uh, reference rate came down 123 basis points. 
That's the, the, the fastest decline that, eh, we've seen, eh, in the recent history. 
We, we didn't saw a, a, an increase of those, eh, you know, of that magnitude when, eh, when interest rates were, were coming up, okay. 
So that's one thing to have in mind, 
the, the, the impact that you see in this quarter, I think is, is probably most 
<inaudible> that we're going to see in a relative basis, relative to the first quarter of this 
year and relative to the second quarter of last year, 
okay. Um, also, bear in mind that when interest rates were close to 4% as we probably 
agree with you that that's where we're headed, 
you know, are close to 5%, you know, and this was, the second and third quarter of 2016. Uh, 
I think that, eh, the, the number that, that we reported, the 448% in this quarter, 
you know have to do with, with what I was referring to, you know, the speed at which interest rates, eh, eh came down, 
and also on top of that, you have the, the, the change in mix on our loan side 
and also, the fact that in order to protect the, eh, the income from eh, interest rates coming down, 
we, we increased our pay, interest securities portfolio significantly, 
you know, and those are, you know, lower margin, uh, eh, assets relative to the, the the loan portfolio. 
Just to, you know, share with you, 
uh, we've bought, in this account, you know, both divestment and maturities. 
The overall growth in our pay investment and securities portfolio is 96 billion over the last 12 months. 
So, um, 
what we expect coming down the road, you know, pay for, the rest of 2020 and, eh, for next year, I think that, 
uh, you know, having said that, there's still a lot of uncertainty, 
you know. I think that probably the, the most severe numbers in terms of name are the ones that we saw this quarter, 
you know, there's probably, you know, 10 to 15 basis points, eh, probably further adjustment or slight, eh, 
improvement for the rest of the year. 
Okay? 
And next year, I think that, eh, we'll, we'll probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing, eh, eh, in this quarter. 
Now, in regarding to the current ratio, 
you're totally right in the sense that we don't target <inaudible>. That, that's, uh, resulting number. 
And, also, you know, when you, eh, make reference to, 
you know, our number 138% looks low relative to <inaudible>, the first quarter this year, they had 140%, 
uh, in this, in the second quarter, they did, as we did also, <inaudible> increase the provisions 
for different to us, they made a significant charge off, 4.6 billion pesos. 
So that's why, you know, they're, their increased to 200%. Uh, 
I'm probably just elaborating, elaborating, eh, the more on what information, you 
know, uh, the letter of provisions that we have, are in line with the expected losses that we, we estimate. 
Um, you know, you might have a, or you might question whether we, you know, this is enough or not, 
you know and let me share with you that, 
you know, under current circumstances, we, we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis, okay? 
So, if <inaudible> recovery in the Mexican economy, 
you know, we have, with these quarters, eh, provisions, we are, you know, more than covered, you know, for the rest of the year. 
Now, do we think that there's going to be a type recovery in the Mexican economy? 
I don't think so. You know, it's very, you know low probability, you know. 
Now, we have a <inaudible>, you know, the, the our leave of provisions, according to other types of <inaudible> more a U type 
or an adverse scenario having agility contraction of 12.5%, 
you know, and under those circumstances, these quarters provisions are not enough for the entire year. 
There could be close to 60 to 75%, depending on the magnitude of the <inaudible> eh, contraction that that you assume, 
okay? 
Eh, eh, so, so there should be, uh, direct correlation between expected losses and provisions 
and the provisions that we are putting forward, we think that with information that we have, 
uh, are quite strong to cover, 
you know, expected losses if the, the, the economy ends up contracting more than we are expecting right now, 
definitely we will need to provide a provision of provisions. 
Something that I, I encourage you to look at if you haven't done so, eh, 
yet, you know, the, the <inaudible> bank <inaudible>, um, they released in the stability, financial stability report, published a few weeks ago, 
an analysis regarding NPL for the entire system. 
And they, what they did is look at information from the entire banking system from the last 20 years 
and they pay, you know, using an econometric model, 
they, they estimated, you know, where are the critical variables that determine NPLs. 
And they break down the, the, the portfolio in consumer loans, in mortgage loans, and in 
corporates. So, once they determine, you know, these econometric model, 
then they provided a, you know, a shock with the variables that we're seeing, uh, lately, and they estimated 
how much, uh, NPL ratios, rate for the entire banking system. 
Um, for consumer loans, that would imply a 32% increase for mortgages 19% and for corporates, also 32%. 
So, when you do that math and you break down, you know, by types of loans, by type of bank, 
you get to see, you know, this is obviously a ballpark estimate because obviously every single bank has different 
practices in origination practices and recoveries and so on, 
but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of using this model, you know, how much you, you will expect at each bank with, with provision, okay? 
Thank you. 
Thank, Hector, for the, uh, detailed responses. We will take the next question. It comes from the line of Ernesto <inaudible> from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, Hector. Thanks for the opportunity. 
Uh, my first question is a follow up on the preventive provisions of 349 pesos. 
So, you think this level of provisions will be enough for the rest of the year? 
Or are you going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments up to the relief program. 
And then my second question is, uh, a different one. Because we would like to know if you have exposure to either Mexico on the 
chapter 11 or <inaudible> that has restructured loans with the banks for about a year. 
But I understand that you can not disclose your exposure 
so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how much to food and beverage 
and if there is a sector that is concerning you. 
And finally, uh, my, my last question is, um, competition in mortgage loans, 
uh, we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates, uh, of mortgages in light of the lower rates, 
so how has been your strategy to attract more, more mortgage clients and how, uh, competitive is your interest rate? Thank you. 
Thank you, Ernesto. Uh, let me, let me start and then maybe I will complement. 
First of all on the <inaudible> of provision, like, um, I have spoken many times to my CRO 
and he basically tells me that, uh, when I ask you and ask him the same question that you're asking me at this point, 
and he says, look, I don't have my crystal ball. Um, so clear and it is quite impossible, 
not impossible, but it is difficult to assess what we're doing, I mean, what I can tell you is that we're doing our best job in, in basically reviewing the portfolio. 
We do like that we see the rate that we review the, the behavior and we're basically trying to 
be as conservative as we can in order to manage it, 
so, um, and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate it's much more complicated. We're going to find out, 
I mean, the payment shock comes in the first week of August. We're preparing for next week actually, when the first loans that went into the holiday start, 
um, to, to mature and we, we see that, we see how the performance of the portfolio 
is and then we'll take, you're going to see our numbers, uh, right as, uh, 
I mean, we're going to take the provisions as soon as they come if, uh, needed, okay? 
And the second point, in Mexico, yes, and, and <inaudible>, we do have, uh, exposure to them. 
Nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank. 
I mean, our top exposure to airlines, 
um, is not big. 
I mean, compared to the top of the heights of the portfolio, I would say, 
eh, probably <inaudible> it's not big. 
It's not very significant versus the size of the bank. 
And, uh, we have loans or provisions already on some <inaudible> to Mexico 
so we can tell you that in, in the provisions that we make, some of them are made to, for the exposure which is not relevant. 
In terms of <inaudible>, 
yes, we do have exposure to them. Also not, I mean, not significant 
and we are basically in those structure and process as of now and, uh, we see that the company can recover, 
uh, fairly, I mean, 
I don't see that <inaudible> in that particular situation <inaudible>. Unfortunately, in front of me and we can back to you on that one, <inaudible> 
In terms of the competition of mortgage loans, um, it's quite important what we do, 
uh, uh, we cannot, important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus our competition. 
If you take a look at what <inaudible> fees, it's a completely different prototype nobody has replicated in the Mexican market. 
I mean, some of the other banks basically have tried to do <inaudible> what we are doing <inaudible>. The 
best rate available in the market. 
But in order to get the rate, uh, rate available in the market, which is seven points, 75% for a 15 year 
mortgage, you have to basically turn into, turn first into your most important bank, to your number bank, number one bank. 
But in order to be able to get that rate, you have to have different products with us 
that basically you have to have your payroll, you have to direct maybe, you, you <inaudible>, you have to have your insurance, 
you have to, Something that you have to do in order to access the rate. 
In that regard, what happens is even if the loan is at 7.75 and we're also very cautious in the loan value that we're doing that, that loan, 
that's why precisely I was explaining in the presentation 
that that's why our <inaudible> for mortgage is 37% larger than the rest. 
So we go directly to the mort- to the wealthy people, 
okay? To the people that are in the best situation right now. 
So we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in this particular situations. 
And also that, um, we get the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve these, 
and have these characteristics to act in this type of role. 
So that's why the, the, the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well 
and is going to be managed, um, or is going be, um, behave in a nice, in a nice way due to that fact, 
okay? And we have seen the way the portfolio has performed 
and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances. 
Okay? So in that regard, 
I mean, there is competition, I mean, there are some banks, I mean, a couple of banks have tried to come in and, and, basically compete with us head to head in this type of situations 
and they have not been able to have the same type of problems that we send to the market. 
Then we came out with another prototype, <inaudible>. 
The <inaudible> basically has a particular and has everything included in the rate. 
You don't have any fees, any commissions. You don't have to pay for any ancillary costs or anything like that. 
So that particular thing is for people that, I mean, that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and that we're not completely clear, it's completely transparent to the client. 
And that is above 9% 
as a rate and, uh, and that's for a difficult, different type of client. So we have 
a Chinese menu for every different type of <inaudible>, uh, what we do 
and, and, for example, <inaudible> for a different sector that is mutual, that is basically clients with lower ticket. 
And, um, well, there are some of these clients are very good and, uh, have very good credit quality and, uh, that's what we decided to compete in that sector. 
I don't know if these answer your question or not. Please be a complement. 
Sure, Hector, um, eh, regarding your first, first question, Ernesto, 
uh, it was, as previously mentioned, uniting <inaudible> on the, you know, 
how severe is the contraction this year. 
You know, and how that impacts the capacity for clients to, to pay back their loans. 
We think that, eventually if there's, uh, you know a U type 
recovery and GDP contracting somewhere around 10-12 %, then 
we have made with the provisions of this quarter, more than half of what we require and that could be, you know, 60-75 % of what we require, 
you know, with information that we have right now, okay? 
But it's going to be dependent on how this evolves 
and obviously we're closely monitoring, eh, you know, how our clients are, are behaving, 
okay. Now on your second question regarding the exposure that you have to Mexican <inaudible>, eh, 
your obviously for reasons we cannot disclose those, but we can, eh, reassure you that 
these two exposures that we have are not within our top 10 exposures, 
eh. To mention, we have already provisions partially exposure 
with Mexico that's close to 45% of the exposure that we 
have that is not material, okay. 
And I don't have with me the breakdown in terms of food and beverage, the breakdown that I have right now 
it's more, uh, the one that is used more for regulatory purposes and do not have that detail. 
But, eh, for sure, we can follow up with that. This 
is super helpful. Thank you very much. 
We'll take the next question. 
It comes from Brian <unk> from Citibank. Please go ahead. 
Uh, everyone thank you for the opportunity to ask question. 
Before my question, I wanted to make a <inaudible> that <inaudible> capability do so <inaudible>, 
what was the percentage, sorry. <crosstalk> I think that's 40%, right. 40%, thank you. 
And, and, 
now for my question, 
uh, you know <inaudible> quality and you mentioned 
<inaudible> portfolio has a large degree of <inaudible>, uh, my 
question is, could you <inaudible> and the <inaudible>. 
What are you expecting in terms of NPL for <inaudible>. Thank you. 
Um, if you like, I can take that, Hector, um, the, you know, credit cards do not have collateral. 
You know, so, so laws given defaults in, in credit cards is, eh, close to 100%, 
you know, you, you basically do not, eh, eh recover that much in terms of, eh, eh, credit cards, 
you know 
and, you know, we think that that's, that's going to be one of the, eh, eh, products, eh, most impacted, you know, when you look at, 
uh, you know, the different types of loans 
that clients have, 
you know, we think that, eh, mortgages are the ones that you, eh, eh, you don't pay, you continue paying, you know, if there's just one loan that you continue paying, that's, 
that's mortgages, and, probably credit cards are, 
eh, you know, at the bottom of, eh, your pay priorities, you know. When you have, eh, eh, trouble. 
The NPLs that, that we see in, in credit cards have been increasingly likely, 
but I think is, you know, probably stable when you compare it historically. 
So we don't expect, you know, a significant, eh, 
deterioration, eh, 
you know, cost of risk by way of, eh, eh, the provisions that, eh we're taking. 
It's close to 11%, 
so, I don't know, Hector if you would like to, if perchance you would like to, to further complement on this. 
This is the operator. Mr. Chavez' line has gone idle. I will try to reconnect him at this time. Would we like to take the next question? 
Eh, sure. The next question comes from Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs. 
Hi. Good morning. Uh, thank you for the call and taking the questions. 
Um, one question on the, the market related income. I know you talked, you know, the big spike in the quarter, but, 
do, do you think that goes back to normal already in the third quarter or do you think that can remain elevated, 
elevated for some period of time, just to get, I know it's hard to predict, but <inaudible> market related income going forward. 
And if I can ask just one follow up on, on the provision, um, you know 
I understand given this <inaudible>, you kind of feel comfortable with where you are, but, you know, if you look at the cost of risk, 
before this quarter had been around 2.6, 2.7, you know. Barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now, 
is that 2.6, 2.7 what we should expect sort of going forward as well. 
Again, barring any significant changes in, in the current scenario? Okay. 
Thank you, I mean, what I can tell you is, 
um, yes we have had a good running in terms of market related income. I think that, that the banks position to lose hope. The, the important point is <inaudible>. 
And, in <inaudible>, it continues to be the way that it is, then you can expect that we can, um, that we can basically have 
good numbers there. 
I don't think that we're going to have, in the, in the, in the third quarter, numbers as good as they were in the, in the, in this quarter, 
both, I mean, it also depends on what's happening in, in the next few days, in the next few months. 
In terms of the provisions and the cost of risk, <inaudible> you want to comment on that? 
Absolutely, eh, you know, 
I think that, eh, once you take out the provisions that we did this quarter, I think that cost of risk 
should be slightly higher than the numbers that, eh, we were having over the last, say, five quarters. 
Eh, but not to levels that we've reported this quarter. 
So some require, eh, eh, 300 pesos point, that, that would be my, my, eh, my take. 
And obviously as you mentioned, you know, with information that we currently have, okay? 
Okay, thank you. I'll take the next question. It comes from the line of Carlos Gomez from HSBC, please go ahead. Hello, good morning. Um, 
I have a question about credit risk but not to your corporate, but to the virtual financial system. 
We already saw one company got, has liquidated, has been put in liquidation, but, eh, by the national banking commission, 
uh, <inaudible> crisis, <inaudible> being unable to operate, so eventually, one would imagine <inaudible> might get into trouble. 
Uh, are you taking special precautions, 
uh, in regard to any sectors of the financial system and do- do you think we- you'll encounter much trouble? Or most of them will be able to go through this okay? 
Thank you. Thank you, Carlos. 
I mean, um, I mean, in all these particular situations, and depend how long the crisis is gonna take. I mean, it's probably gonna take down some financial players. 
I mean, that since we are- yes, we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what, uh, their position is. And their situation. 
Um, and we're gonna basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to- to- to evolve. 
So in that sense, uh, we are very close in, uh, to that particular sector. 
We don't have- I mean, we are not a big lender to the sector. 
I mean, uh, uh, I can tell you that, 
um, if you, uh, they're not in the <inaudible> ten most important clients, they're not financial players. So in that sense, we are not worried about the <inaudible> that we have out to them. 
But we are very concern taking a look and monitoring, uh, them all the time. 
Okay? Hopefully, the crisis is shorter and nobody else goes down. But, um, we'll see what happens. 
Any particular <inaudible> that using money <inaudible> special monitoring? 
You know, market-related or consumer-related or payroll? 
I think microfinance is a sector that we need to be, uh, very close monitoring. We don't have to- we don't have to s- a lot. Big <inaudible> to them. 
But that's a sector that covering would be complicated as always in these type of situations. 
The people that suffer the most are the ones that, uh, are on the- 
are on the base of the pyramid. So, unfortunately that's the case, and we are monitoring that quite closely. Thank you so much. 
take the next question. It comes from <unk> from <inaudible>. Please go ahead. 
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. 
My question is regarding liquidity. Um, 
I mean your liquidity <inaudible> improved nicely in the quarter. 
In part it was all be- to the $1.8 billion, that issuance <inaudible>. 
But also given a very strong increase in funding with banks in this quarter. So could you please provide some <inaudible> to the nature of this funding source. 
And what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters? Thank you very much. 
Eh, hi, Alonzo. Um, you know, there are p- several factors, uh, regarding liquidity. Pay- pay- 
I think that the- the most, um, uh, relevant is our, you know, how we fund a- a, you know, the- let's say the loan to the <inaudible> 
that as mentioned was one of the strongest, uh, numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company. Close to 92%. 
So that's- that's in my opinion, that's the most <inaudible> and fundamental way of, uh, looking at it. 
Then, um, as you rightly mentioned, the, 
um, the debt issuance is, uh, you know, contributed significantly to the increase of our, uh, uh, liquidity coverage 
ratio. 
And we are monitoring, you know, any p- p- potential use of, uh, the committed lines of credit 
that we have with our clients that 
if you look at it, it's probably the one, uh, uh, let's say risk that could materialize in- in- in the short term. 
We have ample of liquidity to honor or pay, you know, every single committed line of credit that, uh, 
that we have. But that- that's the one- 
the most relevant, uh, driver in terms of consumption of, uh, liquidity. 
The other types of, uh, you know, events that could impact our liquidity, 
you know, are, you know, are more gradual. 
You know, and those could be, you know, uh, a contraction in deposits that we're not seeing that. 
Um, and I think that the bank has, uh, 
managed, um, quite practically, you know, per liquidity to be prepared for, 
you know, any potential p- p- you know, really worst case, uh, scenario further down the- the road. 
Thank you. And regarding the line of, uh, your balance sheet, the line of bank and other loans, 
uh, which increased 81% in quarter one quarter. Do you- do you- do you think 
these line would- will remain as close to those levels, or do you think you could substitute these source of funding with 
probably other debt issuances in coming quarters? What your strategy there? 
Uh, you know, we- we monitor constantly the different, uh, type of, uh, funding sources. And depending on the- 
the specific, 
uh, 
uh, 
you know, 10-year cost, you know, we end up, you know, we drawing or take advantage of, uh, the- the different funding sources. 
So, you know, I would say that not only that particular line item, but every single line item is- is- is reviewed, you know. 
And under current market circumstances, we, you know, it's- it's our p- 
obligation to look at better ways of, uh, uh, you know, not only funding the bank, but you know, keeping, uh, structures in place 
so that the bank, you know, can continue supporting, uh, you know, long growth. 
So that's something that we continuously monitor, Alonzo. 
So, so yes, you know, it could be that we keep it at those levels. Or that we reduce it if there's an opportunity to find, you know, 
a- a more effective, uh, funding source. <inaudible>. 
Thank you very much. 
We'll take the next question. It comes from Yuri Fernandes from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Uh, thank you <inaudible>. I have a question regarding the <inaudible> on NPL ratio. Uh, it was not <inaudible> quarter over quarter. 
Uh, and I understood that some peers, they had higher-tier jobs and that may explain a little bit of difference. 
Uh, but given how the players, uh, where the <inaudible> was not as high, uh, we kind of saw more flattish, uh, <unk> behavior. 
Uh, because of the special accounting, because of the <inaudible>. 
So what drove the iterations quarter for- for you? 
And my second qua- uh, question is regarding a special accounting criteria. 
Um, when we look to those numbers, um, the- the balance of NATL, they are much higher than- than they once- the old accounting versus the current special accounting. 
And I would like some kind of difference here, like, uh, a 
very negative outlook would be to see, you know, like those numbers materializing as losses. 
So if you can explain, uh, for me the differences on the special accounting versus the old accounting. 
And if the balance of NATLs there, um, may- may become losses, I would appreciate. Thank you. 
Um, hi Yuri. Uh, in terms of, uh, the NPL ratio, you know, this- this quarter what drove this likely deterioration 
was basically a credit card that went up from 4.14% to 4.82%. 
And the- and it's a miss. Basically going from 2.61% to 3.37%. 
Um, as- as we discuss, uh, during the quarter- 
during the call, um, uh, you know, the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not, uh, enrolled in the- in the support programs. 
So but, uh, we're seeing, you know, this slight deterioration has to do more with what's happening with 
the- the portfolio of the clients that did not- did not enroll in the program. 
And it's not a significant deterioration in our view given, you know, the- the, you know, what's going on in the economy. 
It was just a, you know, a slight deterioration. 
Now, on your second question, 
uh, could you elaborate on that? You know, I- I don't- I don't know exactly what you're comparing. You know, the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria. 
So, uh, the previous accounting, um, before <inaudible> the new regulation for- for COVID, 
um, you have like a table, uh, on your release, uh, comparing, uh, the special accounting criteria versus the former, I think like D6 accounting criteria. 
And when we look to the balance of non-performing loans, I believe the balance you have to date, something like 18 billion pes- 19 billion pesos. 
That im- that implies the 2.5% internal ratio. 
But if you look to the old accounting criteria, the- the D6 accounting, uh, 
I think the balance of NPLs, they are closer to 40, 44 billion pesos. So the NPL ratio, they would be much higher. Uh, 
I understand that maybe a lot of loans that will not really become an NPL, that they are there. 
But my concern is that, uh, as soon as these accounting criteria go- go- goes back to normal, 
if we could see, you know, like a- a- a- a higher need of provisions working on NPLs 
so that's why I ask. The difference, and if it- if- and if it makes sense, you know, to- to expect them worsening, um, on that. You know, 
I think that that, uh, you know, it- it's thoroughly dependent on the level of- or- or the type of assumptions that, uh, we make. 
Because, uh, the- the system that accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of, 
a- a- let's say a <inaudible> and percentage of, uh, you know, how much you- you- the client have paid back. 
So I think that it's- it's a- in my opinion, it's- it's somehow, uh, extreme comparison. 
Okay? So it- it has to do 
with, you know, um, with the, um, uh, special accounting criteria. 
You basically, uh, allow clients not to pay, uh, uh, you know, or every client that's not paying 
their interest and capital, stays current. 
You know, and, uh, under the old, or the prevailing accounting criteria, 
you know, you have to take into account just the- you know, 
when you're 90 days past due, and depending on if you are, you know, let's say, uh, uh, 
corporate client, 
you know. Depending on how much you have already paid back, whether you're 20% or more, or how, you know, the time that has elapsed. 
You know, it- it- it's very, I would say, the precaut- I would say that the presumptions are critical. 
And I think that, uh, 
uh, probably what it's- what's important is to understand that in the following two quarters, we'll get to know the- the hard data. 
You know, we, you know, rather than, uh, you know, comparing those numbers with big assumptions, 
I think that, uh, uh, as soon as clients start paying back or not, we'll get to know, you know, how, you know, the magnitude of the impact. Okay? 
Rather than just making, you know, some assumptions that, you know, could materialize or not. As mentioned during the call, I think that, 
uh, we have make- we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has. You know, the relationship that we have with them. 
And we have also asked them, you know, you know, how they're doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back. 
So taking all that into account, 
that's how we- we come up with this, uh, provisions associated with expected losses that we assume. 
So I would encourage you, Yuri, just to wait 
a couple of quarters 
and with- with the hard data, you know, just analyze, you know, if we, uh, uh, on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures that the banking commission provided. 
And on the other hand, you know, the- the- the true impact that it has had, you know, <inaudible>. 
No, no. Spectacular. Thank you- thank you very much. 
We will take the next question. It comes from Nicolas Riva from Bank of America. 
Yes, thank you very much, um, for taking my question. I have one- one question. I apologize if you already mentioned it. 
Um, uh, so you mentioned that 19% of the- of the loan portfolio, um, has been subject to some kind of relief measure. <inaudible> Um, have 
these measures ended already for any clients, and if so, if you can tell us, 
um, what percentage of these clients, uh, that have resumed, um, payments already since it's been already about, um, four months since the full outbreak of the pandemic. 
And- and if this has not been the case, if the payment holiday hasn't ended for- for any significant amount of clients, 
if you can tell us when you make these- these provision charts, the 3.9 billion pesos in this quarter. 
Um, did you incorporate any assumptions, um, in terms of what will be the percentage of these 19% of these clients under the debt relief program 
that will pay you back once the payment holidays, um, end? Thank you. 
You know, first, the payment holidays, uh, uh, payment holiday period ends, uh, uh, tomorrow. 
So we'll start, the- the- you know, seeing, uh, whether clients, uh, pay back or not, uh, starting next week. 
So we don't have that information yet, 
you know. Now, regarding, you know, how we, uh, uh, made provisions for, uh, for this quarter, you know, and as mentioned, uh, uh, throughout the call, 
you know, we classified, um, the clients depending on the risk that, uh, they have. Um, the exposure that they have with us. 
The relationship that we have- they have with us. 
So we- we classified the, you know, retail clients in 25 clusters. And <inaudible> in 11 clusters. 
So depending on the level of, uh, uh, of cluster that each, uh, client falls in, 
you know, there's either a high risk or high exposure, <inaudible> you know, for clients. 
And we assume certain probability of those clusters 
either paying back their loans or not. 
Okay? So that's how we came up with- with the- with the provisions that, uh, we- we- we made this quarter. 
So yes, there is. But it depends- you know, there are 36 responses in terms of, you know, whether b- 
we expect a high number or number of clients to pay back their loans. 
It's- it's- it, you know, it's- it's because of these analysis that we've done 
that we feel, uh, relatively confident that with the information that we have, what we have provided is- is- is good, uh, is a good provision for <inaudible> deterioration for the rest of the year. Okay. Thank you very much. 
The next question comes from <unk> from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Okay. Thank you very much for taking my question. It is just one. Uh, 
I just wanted to understand the dynamic, uh, of the credit relief program held by the bank. And <inaudible> on NPLs 2.5%. 
And according to my calculation, uh, if their loans reach at almost 15% of total loans, if I'm not wrong. 
Uh, roughly a similar level to the other banks. But different from other players and even considering the Brazilians, the Chileans, <inaudible>. 
Uh, they have a <inaudible>. NPLs 
decreased in the second Q. 
Uh, uh, you mentioned that this deterioration, uh, is coming from the SME and the credit card <inaudible>. 
So I just wanted to understand if this high <inaudible> NPLs behaved worse than expected by the banks, 
considering the amount of loans that were postponed. 
And what does the bank, 
uh, sees for this semester in terms of fostering the credit relief program in case of regulators, uh, extend <inaudible> and change the rules for it. 
So thank you very much. 
I think that, you know, uh, the… First of all, you know the NPLs that, uh, increased that we see in the second quarter 
are also seeded with those clients that do not enter into the, uh, uh, relief program. Okay? 
So you have to do with that 81% of clients that decided not to enter into- into the program. 
And obviously, those clients are also exposed to the- the deterioration of economic activity. You know, uh, 
Hector mentioned, you know, the- the- the, uh, losses that, you know, the employee losses that we've seen. 
Uh, so it's- it has to do more with that. Okay? With the- let's say with the clients that do not enroll in the program. 
Okay? Whether we were expecting, uh, you know, that type of deterioration, 
you know, I think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic deterioration, I think that they're lying, you know. I think that, uh, 
uh, we've, uh, we were not expecting this type of, uh, uh, contraction. 
You know, the magnitude that we are seeing. 
You know, if you look at how every single, uh, uh, analyst updates his forecast for the Mexican economy, every 
week you get to see the downward adjustments. 
So- so I think that it do not surprises us. 
You know, we mentioned that given this- this deterioration of, uh, economic activity, we think it's just a slight deterioration. 
Okay? Um, the- but as mentioned, 
we will get to see the final impact, uh, or the final numbers probably in the next two to three quarters. 
You know, it's not only what happens the rest of the year. 
I think that, uh, uh, this- the impact of the pandemic, at least for Mexico, 
has a possibility of, you know, going further than just 2020. 
So, so we'll get to see that. Okay, 
I think it's- it's a quite early to- to have a definitive view on a complete impact on- on other quality. Okay. Okay. 
Thank you very much. 
The last question comes from <inaudible> from BTT <inaudible>. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. My questions were already answered. Thank you very much. 
There are no further questions in the queue, and I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Hector Chavez for any closing remarks. 
Thank you, operator. And thanks everyone once again for joining Santander Mexico on this call. 
As always, we wish to maintain an open dialog with all of you in the international community. 
So if you have additional- additional questions, please don't hesitate to call or e-mail us directly. Until our next call, please stay safe. Good afternoon. 
This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.
