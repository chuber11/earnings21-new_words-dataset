Thanks, Collin. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis: 
maximizing revenue, offsetting the virus' impact through rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement, 
and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long-term success. 
To those ends, we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter, with September finishing 35% higher than June. 
We executed on our expense-reduction plan, realizing over 25 million affixed-cost savings in the quarter 
with the expectation of delivering more than 85 million in 2020. 
We generated positive EBITDA and cash from operations for the quarter, 
bringing year-to-date free cash flow, excluding M&A and the ABL draw to over 45 million. 
But we strengthened our balance sheet significantly, completing the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, finishing 
the quarter with over 350 million of cash, a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and/or additional <inaudible> debt pay down. 
While the environment remains uncertain, we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption 
and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet. 
On virtually all metrics, our third-quarter results represented a significant improvement from Q 
<inaudible> 2. Same-station revenue finished down 29% year-over-year, but as I mentioned, improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars. 
In the spot market, which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business, 
we saw year-over-year improvement each month, both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars. 
Like last quarter, our diary markets, which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns, outperformed our PPM markets. 
Political, as you might expect, was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swing states. 
We had 5.8 million of political revenue in the quarter, which was a new high-water mark for a third quarter, and have benefited from that spending pace through the election. 
Government spending also contributed positively in the quarter. And, while still negative versus last year, financial, general services, and professional services also outperformed other categories. 
Digital, as a whole, posted another quarter of growth. 
While streaming and local digital marketing services remain pressured in the difficult macroclimate, podcasting more than offset those declines. 
Up nearly 50% in the quarter, podcasts, or casting, delivered record quarterly revenue, 
reflecting our particularly strong news-talk portfolio and our highest ever download count, 
over 102 million in September, up 47% year-over-year. 
Also in the quarter, we launched the new Marketplace Minute, 
a short-form three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, economy. 
Developed in partnership with American Public Media, the Marketplace Minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting. 
Marking the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach, 
the Min- Marketplace Minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcasts' audiences. 
On the expense front, we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately 85 million afis- fixed-cost reductions for the year, 
including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of 36 million. 
More than 25 million of these fixed-cost savings were achieved in Q3, and we anticipate realizing more than 15 million in Q4. 
Many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic-induced revenue declines. 
However, others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future, 
informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and/or developed to meet our evolving business needs. 
For example, we've consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing, research, 
and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization 
as opposed to the more fragmented ad-channel configuration that was previously in place. 
Lastly, we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in non-revenue producing functions. 
With the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management, we delivered positive free cash for the second straight quarter during the pandemic. 
We further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, which 
brought our quarterly, uh, y- qu- quarter end cash balance to more than 350 million. 
These significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead, 
but also the capability and flexibility to act on a creative opportunities that may come our way. 
Looking ahead, as we move into the fourth quarter, 
we continue to see positive momentum in bookings, driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams. 
Current pacing is down in the mid-teens versus last year, with political providing about a 450 basis-point benefit. 
We remain guarded about the finish to the year, given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country, 
pol- potential shutdown measures and reaction to that, and the generally uncertain macro environment. 
So, for the remainder of the fourth quarter and likely well into 2021, 
while we hope for continued improvement, our performance will remain highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events. 
However, it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused 
on continuing to re-engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our cost. 
That said, given our liquidity position, 
more ex- efficient expense profile, and growth initiative, we feel comfortable 
about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when it occurs. 
And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank. 
Thank you, Mary. I, I will start by providing some more detail on the third quarter, speaking on a same-station basis and follow that with some additional color on non-operating items. 
In Q3, total revenue was 196.4 million, down 29.4% from Q3 
2019 but an increase of 34.5% over Q2 total revenue. 
As Mary noted, on a month basis, we saw total revenue improvement as the quarter progressed, with September revenue 35% higher than June. 
Spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter, down in the low 30s versus 2019, 
with digital slightly offsetting those results up 2%, 
driven by our podcasting business, which was up nearly 50% on an entirely organic basis. 
Digital dollars represented over 10% of revenue in the quarter. 
Political spend accelerated as the quarter went on, finishing at 5.8 million 
versus 1.7 million in Q3 2019 and 3.6 million in Q3 2018. 
Of note, this was a record quarter for political, and we're on track for another record quarter in Q4. 
Moving down to P&L, 
expenses declined by 42 million, or 19%, driven by both reductions and bearable cost related to the revenue declines 
and active fixed-cost reductions. 
As Mary mentioned, we continue to expect to rea- realize more than 85 million in benefits in total this year from our fixed-cost actions to date. 
Of these, more than 25 million were achieved in Q3 and more than 15 million will be achieved in Q4. 
Broken down between temporary and permanent effects, 
about 19 million of the 85 million relate to permanent actions, which have an annual <inaudible> expense benefit of approximately 36 million. 
The amount of the temporary cost that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in 2021. 
Putting revenues and expense together for the quarter, EBITDA finished at 20.4 million. 
Normalizing for M&A activity, we once again grew our cash balance by 3.5 million in the 
quarter, bringing total free cashflow generation year-to-date, 
excluding M&A and the ABL draw, to more than 45 million. 
Achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is the result of positive EBITDA generation, rigorous management of working capital, and reduced cap-backs. 
As we said on our last call, we cut our 2000 and tw- 2020 cap-back spend projection to 17 million, 
and with 4 million spent in Q3, we are on track to deliver that. 
Our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced from the combination of lower operating performance and CARES Act benefits. 
So, in Q3, we received approximately 2.5 million of tax refunds related to taxes paid in 2019. 
I would also note that in Q4, working capital requirements coming from increased revenues 
<inaudible> bond interest payment 
and, though small, an estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tower sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated year-to-date. 
We were pleased to announce, about a month ago, the initial closing of the tower transaction, which provided a cash inflow of 202.3 million. 
Under our debt agreements, 64 million, the net proceed from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt pro rata, subject to a 12-month reinvestment right. 
96 million of the proceeds from assets being sold or leased back were required to pay down debt immediately. 
As such, concurrent with the closing, we paid down 49 million of the term loan at par. And on Monday, October 5th, 
we launched a tender offer for 47.2 million of senior-secured bonds at par. 
The tender offer was successfully completed on November 3rd. 
We do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the tower transaction by the end of the first half of 2021. 
Additionally, for tax purposes, the gain in the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year. 
That debt now has been reduced by more than 330 million since the beginning of the year 
and by more than 585 million, or 46%, since the quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy. 
As a reminder, we do not have financial maintenance convenance in either our term loan or bonds, and they do not mature until 2026. 
As mentioned on previous calls, we're also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable piece of property in Nashville 
that we hope to bring to market once commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels. 
Lastly, I wanted to note some new disclosure in our 10-Q related to NCAA. 
Based on the cancellation of March Madness in 2020, we believe the rights fees 2020 season are not payable to NCAA. 
The NCAA, however, chose to terminate the contract based on nonpayment of those fees. 
On September 28th, 2020, we and the NCAA filed competing lawsuits with regard to the dispute surrounding the agreement. 
While it is always important for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable, we believe in the merits of our position. 
At this stage, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the <inaudible> litigation, but we will keep you informed as it progresses. 
With that, we can now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Thank you. 
To ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 1. 
To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
And your first question comes from Michael <unk>, Novo Capital Market. 
Thank you for taking the questions. 
Um, first of all, I am… I, I was wondering… You had mentioned that you have, obviously, now a large cash position. It was… 
And you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pare down debt, 
so I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about 
uses of cash and then, also, if there are M&A opportunities, what you may be looking at. Sure. Hi, Mike. Um, you know, I, I, 
I think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us, uh, in a fantastic s- position to be defensive about the 
uncertainty that exists but, as you point out also, opportunistic in ways that we can use, uh, cash to drive value. 
So, obviously, playing down debt remains a huge priority, 
and, uh, we know there is a great return to use our cash that way. However, you know, uh, uh, should interesting opportunities come our way, 
we're open to considering that, uh, whether in radio or otherwise. 
Uh, but we do recognize the high bar for expected return. 
And I was just wondering as you were kinda giving us some, um, thoughts about, uh, Q4 and, and the, and the pacings there. 
Can you just kinda give us a little bit about, uh, color on maybe, uh, spot versus network, um, what you're seeing in digital? 
Um, just kind of give us a little bit more color on the, um, on the individual line items, uh, in Q4. 
Um, hi, Michael. It's, uh, Frank. 
Uh, first, let me, uh, comment about Q3, then I'll give you a little bit more color on Q4. So Q3 had a, a very nice recovery in both the spot and the network markets. 
And, as you heard in my prepared remarks, they performed comparably. 
Uh, but I will say that, in the third quarter, uh, the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter as we got into a more, uh, normalized environment. 
Um, in the fourth quarter, um, both channels are progressing nicely. We're benefiting, uh, in the network, uh, from the return of the NFL, uh, which we're pleased with. 
Um, the… Uh, the national markets are, are stronger. 
Uh, if you look at the local markets, though, um, part of the benefits we're getting, uh, in the local markets, clearly political which displaces, to some extent, uh, some of the local business. 
Uh, so the trends, um, at this point, uh, we're seeing is fairly strong, but it's very <inaudible> and we're cautious, uh, 
with regard to the, the pandemic and, and the spread and, uh, it remains to be seen how that will impact the rest of the quarter. 
And how did the bookings look as you go into December, which is outside of the political realm of, you know, what you may have gotten for, in, in, um, in October and November? 
At this point, we'll really just comment on pacing, um, as of this date. Um, and you'll have more color, obviously, in our earnings call, uh, next year. 
Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you. 
As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
That is Star 1. To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
And there are no questions at this time. 
Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. Thanks. <inaudible>. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
