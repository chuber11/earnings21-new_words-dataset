Additionally, on today's call management statements include a discussion of certain non-gap financial measures, which are intended to supplement and not be substitutes for comparable gap measures. 
Reconciliations of such supplemental information to the comparable gap measures will be included as part of today's presentation and in our earnings release. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Brett Ponton. Brett. 
Thank you, Maureen, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
I'll get started today with a brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an update on the progress we've made on our Monro Forward Strategy. 
As illustrated on slide three, we reported comps down 0.9% in the third quarter as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic. 
In October and the beginning of November, we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year. 
Mild weather conditions towards the end of November and in December caused the slowdown across our core Northern markets. 
These conditions have continued into January with our comparable store sales down 4% during the month. 
We do not like talking about the weather, however, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business. 
While we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter, we are executing well against the areas within our control. 
In particular, we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and are confident we are on the right path. 
We are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances. 
Moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter, we were down 1% year over year in tire comparable store sales, 
as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline in tire volume. 
We experienced more normalized retail price in this quarter and are focused on further refining our entire strategy to drive strength in our largest category. 
Importantly, we are on track to roll out our tire category management and pricing system beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, 
which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real-time pricing, 
I'll provide more details on this shortly. 
Turning to our service and repair categories, we saw a 3% decline in brakes year over year, falling short of a difficult comparison in third quarter last year. 
In maintenance, we were flat while front-end shocks were down 1% and alignments declined 3% year over year. 
Overall, our Southern markets outperformed our Northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region. 
New stores added 22.7 million in revenue during the quarter, including 20.7 million from recent acquisitions. 
Regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter, 
we saw a decline of 20 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales, 
which resulted in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales. 
Our variable margin, on the other hand, expanded due to lower year over year material costs as a percentage of sales 
while slightly higher than the prior year quarter, technician labor as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially from last quarter. 
This is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control. 
We identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective action to drive improved results. 
We will have additional opportunities to continue to improve results in this area 
as we implement our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year, 
which will be critical for us to seamlessly adjust to changes in demand, demand dynamics without sacrificing sales. 
I'd now like to turn to the progress we've made on our Monro Forward Strategy, beginning with our store rebrand and re-image initiative on slide four. 
This initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while 
also implementing standardized in-store operating procedures, 
which we call our Monro playbook. Additionally, we are rebranding select stores to a tire oriented banner 
where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues. 
During the first half of fiscal 2020, we finalized the transformations of our first group of stores, which includes 44 locations in Rochester, New York, 
and the Mid-Atlantic as well as the second group, which includes 43 stores in our Southern markets. 
During the third quarter, we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward 
with the transformation of 74 stores in four markets, and 42 of our recently acquired California stores. 
We have completed the transformation in the 74 stores 
and have substantially completed our California stores, which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner to drive higher awareness for tires. 
Turning to slide five, I'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base. 
As many of you know, we operate in two store 
formats, our service brand stores, which generate approximately $600,000 per store in annualized sales 
and our tire brands stores, which generate approximately 1.2 million per store in annualized sales. 
Prior to any rebrand activity, we operated 555 service brand stores, and 734 tire brand stores. 
And as we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores, we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brands. 
Throughout this process, we will be consolidating our regional brands, focusing on shifting our service brands over to tire brands. 
The lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity. 
When we speak to re-imaging stores, this primarily means modernizing the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change. 
As we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus re-imaging stores, we are leveraging our analytical model 
as well as taking into account our brand equity in that market. 
Looking at the bottom left of the slide, you can see here, the progress we have made so far. 
We are very much in the early innings of this transformation with 203 stores substantially completed out of our portfolio. 
We've separated these stores out between comp stores and non-comp stores, which helps us to evaluate their performance post-refresh. 
Of our approximately 900 comp stores that we set out to transform, 
we've completed 134 stores and of our approximately 150 non-comp stores, we have substantially completed 69. 
As we move forward with expanding this program across our base, we will continue to prioritize markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit 
to our sales performance and our approach will be measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum. 
Through the end of this fiscal year, we're focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired California stores 
while starting the transformation of approximately 80 more stores that will be completed in Q1 
of FY21. 
Moving on to the performance of the stores we've completed so far, to help provide some additional granularity, 
we separated out how rebranded stores have performed versus the stores that have just been re-imaged. 
Importantly, this data only includes comp stores that had a full quarter of performance following the completion of their transformation. 
This is how we will speak to this performance, excuse me, of our transformed stores moving forward. 
As you can see, and in line with our expectations, we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand stores. 
This shift optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sales without sacrificing our service revenues. 
The stores that have been re-imaged were slightly down as these are located in our Northern markets, which were impacted by the mild weather conditions I mentioned earlier. 
We believe this performance clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits to come with a streamlined brand portfolio. 
The 74 stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation, given they have not had a full quarter post transformation 
yet, but we are still, we are seeing early signs of strength at these stores and are pleased with the results. 
While we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base, 
to sustain performance. we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation to, date, underscores the impact of this important initiative. 
Turning to slide six and the remainder of our Monro Forward Initiatives, I'd like to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority, 
which we believe will be critical to supporting our broader strategy. 
In the third quarter, we began modernizing our store IT infrastructure at all of our approximately 1300 locations. 
This new infrastructure enables 
state-of-the-art technology, including our new digital phone and texting system, which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience. 
This system will allow us to better track customer execution, driving a more consistent phone strategy and improve conversion. 
Our store infrastructure monetization will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, 
allowing us to leverage our new phone system, which will be critical to driving traffic to our stores. 
Another priority for us is the optimization of our tire category management. 
We are on track and by the end of this fiscal year, we expect our new pricing software will be operational. 
We believe this will be critical to driving long-term margin expansion 
by providing improved visibility into demand dynamics, allowing us to better refine our assortments 
and execute our strategy to become the number one destination for tires at any price point. 
Finally, we are right on track to roll out our cloud-based store scheduling model pilot by year end, 
gaining real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales 
or overstaffed when there is a lack of demand. 
Regarding our other teammate initiatives, we have rolled out the Monro University program to all of our teammates and are continuing to expand and enhance the course content. 
We've also implemented mandatory onboard training to ensure that everyone who joins our team is trained on our Monro playbook operating procedures 
in order to provide a quality five-star experience to our customers. 
Moving on to slide seven, while we are very focused on the rollout of Monro Forward, acquisitions remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy. 
During the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisition of three companies, 
one with 14 locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and four in Boise, Idaho, as well as two companies that include nine stores in Northern California, 
further solidifying our brilliant position in the Western United States. 
Our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts, as well as benefit from the high concentration of vehicles in this market 
and the potential long-term consumership <inaudible>. 
The acquisition in Nevada and Idaho, which are new States to Monro is expected to add approximately 20 million in annualized sales, 
representative sales make for 75% service and 25% tires. 
The acquisitions in California expects to add approximately 25 million in annualized sales, 
representatives sales makes a 55% service and 45% tires. 
These ac- acquisitions are expected to be diluted, to delude earnings per share in fiscal 2020. 
Overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected 120 million in annualized sales. 
We operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation. 
And we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive M&A targets. 
We currently have over 10 NDA signed with opportunities ranging from five to 40 stores, 
which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint 
into attractive and underserved regions. 
Further by continuing to execute our Monro Forward Initiatives, including our new brand standards and operating procedures, 
we expect it integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently. 
Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during third quarter, bringing our total Greenfield store openings to seven in fiscal 2020. 
In conclusion, we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our business. 
We are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable longterm growth. 
We are not there yet, nor do we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation, 
but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, making the appropriate course corrections when necessary 
and executing well against the areas within our control. 
I'd like to thank the entire team at Monro for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy, as well as our customers and shareholders for their continued support. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Brian D'Ambrosia, 
who'll provide additional detail on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook. 
Thank you, Brett, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter. 
Sells increased 6.2% year over year to $329.3 million 
driven by sales from new stores of $22.7 million, including $20.7 million from recent acquisitions. 
Partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately $0.8 million. 
Same sales in the quarter were down 0.9% year over year. 
The third quarter of fiscal 2020 had 89 selling days in line with the previous year period. 
Those margins decreased 20 basis points to 37.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from 38% in the prior year period. 
This decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs 
as a percentage of sale as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales. 
However, as Brett mentioned, we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales. 
Operating expenses for the quarter increased $5.5 million to $92.8 million or 28.2% of sales 
as compared with $87.3 million or 28.1% of sales for the prior year period. 
The year over year dollar increase includes expenses from 103 net new stores. 
Our operating income for the third quarter was $31.6 million, 
which increased by 2.8% as compared to operating income of $30.7 million 
for the same quarter last year, and decreased as a percentage of sales from 9.9% to 9.6%. 
That interest expense for the third quarter increased $0.2 million to $7 million as compared to $6.8 million in the same period last year. 
The weighted average outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by approximately $112 million as compared to the prior year period. 
The increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease that recorded in connection with our fiscal 2020 acquisitions in Greenfield expansion, 
as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisition. 
The weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased 
by approximately 140.2 basis year over year, due to lower LIBOR and prime interest rates, as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases. 
Our effective tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter, compared to 15.3% for the same period last year. 
The year over your, year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment we realized in the prior year 
related to a retroactive accounting method change, 
which was related to certain deductions that the IRS accepted during an examination of our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 tax returns. 
That income for the third quarter was $18.9 million compared to $20.5 million in the prior year period. 
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 cents compared to diluted earnings per share of 61 
cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-gap measure for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 60 
cents, which excludes from diluted earnings per share 3 cents of costs related to Monro Forward Initiatives, and 1 cent of cost related to acquisition due diligence and integration. 
This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 57 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, 
which excluded 1 cent of costs related to Monro Forward Initiatives, 1 cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs, 
and 6 cents benefits from the one-time income tax adjustment. 
For more information on this non-gap measure, please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release. 
Lastly, we opened one Greenfield location during the third quarter, as a reminder, Greenfield stores include new construction 
as well the acquisition of one to four store operations. 
Greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately $1 million each annual sales. 
As of December 28th, 2019, the company had 1,289 company operated stores and 99 franchise location 
as compared with 1,186 company operated stores and 99 franchise locations as of December 29, 2018. 
During the third quarter, we had a 27 company operated stores and closed none. 
Turning to slide nine. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy. 
Our capital expenditures were $42.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 
of which approximately $18 million was related to investments in our Monro Forward Initiative. 
We are pleased with the progress of our Monro Forward Strategy, 
and we continue to expect an incremental $75 million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate 
over five years to support investments in story image and technology. 
Additionally, a creative acquisition support our, our growth strategy. 
During the first nine months of the year, we spent approximately $104 million on acquisitions, 
including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our Greenfield expansion strategy. 
As Brett mentioned, acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 collectively represent an expected $120 million in annualized sales. 
I'd like to provide some additional clarity here. 
The $120 million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated, 
which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post- it's acquisition. 
During years one and two, following the acquisition, we typically see a step-down in sales, given the process of onboarding new stores to our model. 
Moving on, we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program 
and paid approximately $22 million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. 
Finally, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiatives. 
We entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenant. 
We generated approximately $125 million of cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 
and debt under our revolving credit facility increased by approximately $59 million. 
Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2020 on slide 10. 
We have updated our fiscal 2020 comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of 1% to flat to reflect the impact of our year to day performance. 
Based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisition, 
we now anticipate fiscal 2020 sales to be in the range of $1 billion $275 million to 1 
billion $290 million, an increase of 6.2% to 7.5% as compared to fiscal 2019 sales. 
This compares to the previous sales guidance range of $1 billion $295 million to $1 billion $315 million. 
Our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal 2020. 
Given the impact of our year to day performance, we expect fiscal 2020 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.25 cents to $2.35 
cents representing a decline of 5.1% to 0.8% year 
over year, compared to $2.37 cents in fiscal 2019. 
This compares to the previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 cents. 
On an adjusted basis, which is a non-gap measure, 
the company when he expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 cents to $2.45 
cents, representing a decline of 1.7% to growth of 2.5%, 
which excludes from diluted earnings per share Monro Forward Initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration costs. 
This compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.39 cents in fiscal 2019, 
which excluded Monro Forward Initiative costs, non-recurring corporate and field management realignment cost, 
acquisition due diligence and integration costs and the benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment. 
Acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal 2020 are expected to be diluted to earnings per diluted share during the year. 
At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect an operating margin of approximately 10.2%, 
interest expense to be approximately $29 million, depreciation and amortization to be approximately $65 million 
and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million. 
We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $60 million this year. 
This guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and is based on 34 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
As always, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or Greenfield store openings. 
I'll now turn the call over to Brett, to provide some closing remarks before we move to Q and A. Thanks, Brian. 
We are making strong strides in the execution of our Monro Forward strategy in particular, our store rebrand and re-imaging initiative. 
The strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative. 
The store rebrand and re-emerge program is further supported by our technological investments, which we believe will help drive long-term margin expansion. 
In summary, we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business, 
making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control. 
We are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.

Our first question is coming from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. 
Good morning. Morning, Brian. So I wanna foc- and I, I apologize for, 
uh, focusing on the weather here, but I do, I do just wanna dive a little deeper into, uh, sales trends in the quarter. 
So Brett, you mentioned, I think Brian, you did too on in your prepared comments, just, you made some comment, commentary suggesting that, you know, to the degree to which weather impacted the business. 
I was wondering if you could drill down a little further and say, you know, what that negative 0.9 comp, you know, would have been had the weather cooperated 
and some of the other, the other metrics you're seeing that really suggest the underlying businesses is trending better than what we saw, uh, in the, in the weather affected, uh, fiscal Q3? Yeah, 
I'll take the first part and I'll let Brian take the second part of the question, 
Brian. Uh, when we look at the performance in the quarter, 
as we've talked about, our Northern markets certainly underperformed than Southern markets and I'll give you a little more granularity on that. Uh, certainly our stores up in the Northeast, 
um, and the Midwest were where you would expect to have more exposure to weather conditions, uh, like you have in the Northeast, certainly under perform. 
I think it's difficult to say what we would have done, 
um, you know, certainly I think we were expecting, you know, positive comps in the quarter. 
Uh, our internal, uh, expectations would have been closer to plus one or plus one and a half, uh, assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past. 
Uh, we felt really good coming out of October, November, given the strength of last year's performance that we were competing against. 
And, and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in December that we were certainly expecting. 
Uh, as I made the, the comments in my prepared remarks, we certainly don't like talking about the weather, 
Brian, but we can't ignore the fact that when 50% of our business is tires and 
we have a high concentration of stores in the Northeast and Midwest, we are going to have outsized exposure to, uh, 
our account performance. 
Brian, would you mind maybe taking, restating the second part of your question? 
Well, I think, look, I think you've covered. 
Right, maybe I'll just bounce, right, I have a follow-up question if I, if I could. So the guide, the, the adjusted guidance and you, you mentioned, so in January you were, did, uh, I think a negative four. 
Now, if I'm doing the math, it looks as though that the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pickup then in business in, in February, March. I, 
I guess the first question is, is that assumption correct? 
And then the following question is, and I know we've seen this before with your business, 
but you know, at what point does, because we still have a long, we 
have potentially a long time in the winter, the weather could still come, but is there a point at which in, in, in the quarter where the, the weather just comes too late? 
Yeah. So, so Brian, your assumption is correct, um, regarding the, uh, regarding the implied comps. So if you think about Q4 at the mid 
point, uh, of let's say down 0.5, for the full year down 0.5, 
that implies Q4 of down two, 
which would, uh, be about February and March being down one in order to get to that down two. 
So that, that's the dynamic at the midpoint. So there is an expectation of, uh, of a pickup in February and March. And, and 
Brian, maybe just to comment on the second part, um- Yeah. You know, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter, 
our fourth quarter and the second half of the quarter in particular, 
I think we've become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of the pure winter conditions into, uh, spring. 
Um, certainly I think, you know, that later in the 
quarter you get snow falls, certainly doesn't 
have the same impact on tire demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in October or November. 
Uh, consumers are pretty, uh, thrifty with their money and I believe if you get snowfall late in the season, 
they have a tendency to forgo that first purchase and push it out until next season in particular. 
The other thing to call out, uh, as well as, if you look at our store performance at the company, uh, 
December and January have always been the most volatile, volatile months that we had to contend with. And 
I think what we've seen in past performance here, 
um, friends coming out of December, January don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring. Uh, 
so, um, given the, the mild December, January heading into, um, the balance of the quarter, we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided, 
as Brian said, our midpoint assumes that. On the low end of our comp sales guidance that assumes run rate coming out of January, which we certainly believe we're gonna be better than that 
as we roll into FY21. I, 
I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Lamers of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Thanks. Um, Brett, looking at your slide on the store rebranding, uh, you know, the 18% performance of the rebranded stores. Um, I think it's good. Uh, I'm, 
I'm curious from your analytic model, how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales? 
Well, if you look at, look at the top quadrant of that slide, Jonathan, 
um, we've shared, you know, with investors, the fact that our service stores do roughly $600,000 in revenue and our tire stores do a million too. 
So in a case where we're rebranding a service store, your, you're working off a base on average of 600,000, 
and if we've seen, I'll call it a double digit comp improvement 
off of that base, you can get to implied 
number certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to, uh, the full maturity equally, and the average sales, uh, 
performance of our tire branded stores. And 
that's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us, so it's not that it's just a one-time step up in sales. 
This creates the opportunity to create multiple years of, 
uh, sustainable 
growth as our brand and our positioning, uh, our brand related to tires starts to mature. 
Uh, keep in mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years, 
so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires, uh, we won't be relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out. 
So, uh, so to put that on a timeline that you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales performance of a tire brand store. Okay. 
So just to circle up on that, for the stores where you're rebranding, there's nothing about their market, 
um, like you, you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores of the 1.2 million. Is that correct? Yeah. 
As a general statement, that's correct. I think certainly you're gonna have markets that will exceed 
the average and you'll have some markets that will be lower than that. 
And that's part of the choices that we, that we make using the analytic model. 
But, but on average, as we look across our, 
I'll say the opportunity stores at the end of 555, 
I think we feel very comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the 1.2 over time as they mature. 
Thanks. Uh, switching gears, Brian, how much of a headwind, 
um, to that, uh, revenue from acquisition were the conversions of the 42 California stores this quarter? Yeah, 
I mean, we, we had, uh, you know, some disruption there. Um, I would say, you know, 
uh, we, we haven't really quantified that, um, from a, from a sales standpoint. But, you know, that's a great point, Jonathan, and that 
we have, uh, immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the Monro playbook, 
uh, and then shortly thereafter, and in this case about six months, 
uh, get the re-image, uh, in store brand standards in place. 
Uh, so those, uh, in Q3, uh, the 42 California stores went through that. Um, and there were substantially through that, uh, uh, as of the end of Q3. 
Um, so we're, we haven't quantified it, but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter. 
Okay. And that 1.8 million charge for Monro Forward Initiative, uh, this quarter, what was that for? 
Yeah, it was all related to the store rebrand and re-image, um, and it falls into three primary buckets, uh, related to that. 
Uh, the first is non-capital, uh, items that we send to the stores. So as we think about, uh, updated, uh, safety chains, updated bay banners, updated point of sale marketing materials, 
all of these things to get the store initially to, uh, the standard, 
uh, that are not capital, uh, in terms of the actual, uh, work and construction done on the store. 
That's the first bucket. 
The second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done. 
We get into these stores and we identify non-capital repairs, uh, 
demolition, uh, as well as, um, some of the fixed verse replaced items, 
for example, stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor. 
Those are things that, uh, make sense economically, but you get different treatment from expense versus capital for, 
so that's the second bucket. 
And the third is just right off of existing leaseholds in the stores. 
Uh, anything from counters to, uh, maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a Monro brand. 
Um, those are the three primary buckets that, uh, that the, the Monro Forward Initiative costs, uh, consist of. Okay. Thanks for your comments. Thank you. Excuse me. 
Our next question is coming from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Hey, good morning guys. Morning, Bret. Morning, Bret. Hey, uh, back to slide five, I guess if we look at the 18% growth in rebranded stores, 
if were to look at the comparable growth there, you know, X the new product lines you're adding, how's the service, um, comp against the service comp in those stores? Are you saying, 
you know, a pickup as you change the brand? 
Yeah. Maybe just to clarify though, Bret, I think we're actually not adding any new products to the service menu. Uh, <crosstalk>. Right, <crosstalk>, right? 
Yeah, it's just a mix, right, so we, even our service stores, they sell tires, it's only 15% of their mix. 
So we're certainly seeing growth, more outsized growth in other tire sales. 
And we've had success in maintaining, uh, the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side, 
which has been part of our thesis is, 
uh, hold 
on, uh, to the service business that enjoyed it's high margin, 
uh, and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the, the tire category 
<crosstalk> on both sides. 
Okay. And I guess when we look at the re-image, 
how does that compare to, you know, comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged? I guess sort of looking at it again, sort of apples to apples, you know, against the old stores? Yeah, 
I think if, uh, if you can figure out what stores we're talking about there, the 30 stores are Rochester, I think- Yeah. The 
Rochester store, certainly if, they have been performing quite well, uh, relative to what our expectations were on re-image. 
We certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of the re-imaged store we set out to do this initiative. 
Uh, but we were seeing a more positive growth out of the stores up until the last quarter, 
uh, given the exposure that we've had to, uh, the weather in the North. 
But compared to other stores, uh, we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view, relative to their peers, 
uh, facing similar, I would say market backdrop from a weather point of view. Okay. 
Could you give us, I guess, sort of the, the, the spread between the Southern store comp and the Northern store comp, you know, how big a Delta was it? 
I mean, it was, it was, uh, a couple of hundred basis points of performance. Okay. And I guess for housekeeping, could you give us the monthly? 
Uh, yeah, so, uh, we were, uh, one second here, Bret, 
we were down, uh, 1.2 in October, down 1.7 in November and now 0.4 in December. Okay. 
And then one, just, this is the… Sorry, add the questions. 
On the supply chain side, I mean, just to throw the virus into it, since that's popular these days, 
you guys do a lot of direct sourcing, um, you know, the, the white box product out of China. Do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on? 
Uh, we haven't seen any, uh, to this point, Bret, 
uh, we're obviously working through contingency plans, which we've 
had to develop actually related to the, the tariff issues. 
So we feel pretty confident that through the network of, you know, the multiple supply points, that we'll be able to, 
uh, overcome any particular issues coming from the virus. 
<crosstalk>. Yeah, I'm sorry, Bret, go ahead. I said, no, I was joking, but I had to get mt first virus question in there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right, thanks a lot guys. Okay, thanks Bret. Thanks, Bret. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rick Nelson 
of Stevens. Please go ahead. All right, thanks. Good morning. 
Like 
to- Good morning. follow up on whether, uh, last year, I think December, January, you also pointed to 
mild winter weather. 
Do you think this year, uh, was incrementally worse, uh, than than the prior year? 
I think if you look at, uh, you know, analyst reports that we've seen, 
uh, talking about, I guess the impact of the mild winter has had on not only our category, but I think other retail, 
I think the data would indicate that this has been more mild, uh, certainly versus last year. And I think we look at precipitation, 
uh, which was very important for us, the form of snow with our entire business. 
Certainly it's been, uh, a much, I think, more mild, uh, winter this year relative to last year. 
Okay, 
thanks. And Brett, any update on your partnership 
with Amazon, 
uh, what you're saying there on the install side 
and how you think your tire prices compare to theirs 
in the tire category over- overall. I'm curious about what happened with units in the period and the market share. 
Yep. So, 
uh, let's start with units, well, units were down two, uh, and average selling price was up, uh, one, uh, for the, for the, uh, for the quarter. 
Uh, how that compares, we don't have a lot, you know, of syndicated data. Of course, we can look to and give you definitive on that. 
We lean on, I guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands 
and it feels like, you know, similar to other companies that have exposure to the North, in particular Northeast. But to the degree that we do, 
we feel like we are probably in line with what, you know, we picked up through suppliers and, and others. 
Um, as it relates to Amazon, I think we're still, you know, pleased with our relationship with them as well as other online tire retailers. 
Uh, we, uh, we will eventually expand on the relationship in FY21 to include all stores. 
We talked about last quarter, our priority has been, uh, what I mentioned on today's call, uh, completing the entire category management 
pricing tool, as well as the labor scheduling tool that are just for our organization, 
I think, a higher priority at this stage than expanding. Uh, but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward. 
Uh, related to tire pricing, 
uh, as you know, Rick, the tire category is very complicated, you have, you know over 30,000 skews that, uh, that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets. 
And one of the reasons why we've invested in the tire category management tool is that, 
to do a couple of things. One is, 
give us much better visibility into demand dynamics defined by elasticity, 
uh, down to a skew level. 
And by having that visibility, it's gonna create a much more granular approach that we're gonna use for pricing. Uh, it'll allows us to price that, the skew level, 
uh, in our industry, uh, with the intent theme, strike that right balance between driving the right price to drive unit volume 
while preserving and expanding our entire margins through a right mix at right price. 
Uh, I'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now, uh, we will be operational by Q1 of next year, 
uh, fully operational. Uh, the rollout of that it's pretty small in scale because we control our pricing centrally. So a small team of people will be trained up on using that system. 
So between now and Q1, we'll be testing in parallel to make certain we're confident with, uh, the results that we're seeing from the setup. 
That, uh, that makes sense. Thanks for the color, and good luck. Thanks, Rick. Be safe. 
Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press * 1 on your telephone keypad. 
Our next question is coming from Stephanie Benjamin's of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. Morning. Um, 
I wanted to go back, I know in the prior quarters, when you started rolling out some of these story freshers, you called out, uh, 
a hit or headwind to comps during that quarter, really just from distraction. 
You know, it sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping the stores, 
I believe you said it was about a 70 basis point hit last quarter. 
Did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or to whether, um, overshadow that? Yeah, 
I think we said last quarter, uh, Stephanie, that we, I mean, we walked everyone kind of through the, the seven step process and, and talked about how we were 
retooling it to take, take, um, a lot of that work or almost all that work off of the store team. 
So we were able to effectively do that in, in Q3. 
We didn't expect that we were gonna have to talk about a headwind, uh, and we really don't have to, in terms of, it, from disruption related to the story image. Um, 
I think, I think, uh, the California stores on the West Coast, uh, maybe saw a little bit more in disruption just because we did put a little bit more on them 
based on their proximity, you know, lack of proximity to our, our core resources that are doing the re-image, 
but for the 74 comp stores, those were largely, uh, I would say undisrupted. 
Great. And then just as, uh, a followup, when we look at the tire category in general, what are you seeing from the silver and 
in the inflationary environment? I know it was inflationary earlier this year, um, kind of reviewing how, how you thought during the quarter and the expectation going forward as well. 
Uh, yes, Stephanie. When you look at, uh, go back to one of the things we commented on was just, 
we saw, uh, some inflationary pricing on, I'll say the top end of the product category with more premium brands. 
Uh, and the first part of the, the second quarter, we didn't see a lot of movement on the, on the low end brands, if you will, opening price point brands. 
We saw that change exiting Q2 and into Q3, and I think as you saw on, we made the comments in our prepared remarks. 
We certainly feel better about pricing moving up across, uh, all, all price points. 
Uh, relative to that point in Q3, I think our expectation for Q4 is pretty stable environment, 
uh, around pricing. Uh, we don't expect, you know, meaningful or material changes, uh, in the next quarter. 
Uh, you know, I think we're, we're very focused now on now optimizing, you know, our internal pricing relative to the market, leveraging, you know, the category management price into what we talked about. Great. 
And then just lastly, for me, kind of a more high level, 
as you know, we think through the strategy to expand your, your tire services at some of those, the mix changes that your service stores. 
Does that just by nature put you a little bit more susceptible to changes in weather on an annual basis, 
you know, to your point, you said on the call that, 
you know, it is the tire category that we're, if it's a more mild weather where you don't really see the, 
the, the volume during that period. 
So does this mean that, you know, these conversations going forward, whether could have a larger impact or similar to what we saw this year that maybe in prior year? So maybe your thoughts on that 
this high level would be great. Uh, thanks so much. Yeah. 
Thanks, Stephanie. I think, you know, strategically, um, I will, I will start with this, their strategy <inaudible>, we like the business model at our stores 
that has a very focused menu that's focused on tires and full service. 
I think you're not gonna see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned. 
We like diversification in the 
services, uh, we like, you know, being very relevant on frequently purchased items like scheduled maintenance for cars and, and certainly breaks another under car services. Um, 
I think as we increase our 
total business, uh, certainly we were gonna pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the North, uh, I think do that. 
However, I think our broader company strategy is diversify our store footprint 
more into the South and out West, 
and certainly in those regions of the country, you don't see, I think the level of volatility 
that comes with the tire business, like you would find in, in the Northeast and Midwestern markets. Great. That's everything for me. I appreciate it. Okay. Thanks, Stephanie. Thank you. 
Our next question is coming from Scott Stember of C.L. King. 
Please go ahead. Uh, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, Scott. Um, following up on that last question about, um, you know, high level about weather, and I know the goal here was, with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now and all these new processes, 
to get to the point where, I guess we're not talking about weather having a work… Weather does not really dwell the quarter from a comp perspective. 
Could you talk about, I mean, just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take for us 
to get to that point where weather could be a headwind, but it's not going to be a determinant, whether you're positive or negative, uh, from comp standpoint? Yeah, 
I think, you know, given our, our exposure to the Northeast 
and as long as our store concentration is heavy in the Midwest and Northeast, inherent in that is we pick up 
exposure, I think, to, to the weather. 
Um, obviously we don't like to talk about this, as you said, our strategy is to diversify the footprint. 
Um, keep continuing to grow down South and that's reflected by our 
acquisitions. We continue to build out Florida and we've expanded now into Louisiana 
and, uh, 
in Tennessee, and certainly out West is reflective of that desire to create more or less volatile, volatility in our business due to the store, store footprint. 
Now, in our Gore store markets, 
uh, we don't accept internally, you know, the volatility in our business 
and, and we're, we're invested in technology as we talked about to help us better execute 
in stores through better trained people, uh, executing better on the phones with our, our phone upgrade that we're currently doing. 
All of the initiatives under Monroe Forward are designed to drive 
performance in our stores regardless of weather, that I think will help neutralize some of the impact that we see from, from the volatility that comes with, 
uh, snow and colder temperatures. 
Got it, and just a last question. Um, 
I know that there are certain things like tires that we'll see an immediate impact from, from weather, but more on the side of mechanical parts, 
typically you 
could see an impact from, you know, uh, warmer weather or cold weather, you know, a few quarters down the road. Is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on 
the mechanical parts side in the next couple of quarters? And that's all I have. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think as we commented in the quarter, our breaks were down 3% in the quarter. 
Um, certainly we're up against strong comp from last year, but also I would say we do sell a fair share of, uh, brake services, uh, through tires. 
Because if you take the consumers tires off their vehicle, it gives you the chance to inspect their wheels, their brakes, 
and, we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires in the breaks as a result of that. 
Um, as it relates to the downstream effect, uh, I think, uh, certainly more harsh winters, uh, have a tendency to tear up things on the vehicles. 
However, I will say, uh, one benefit of having a more mild winter is usually that leads to spring coming sooner. 
Uh, that opens up a window, I think, for an extended spring selling season. 
So, uh, look 
we're, we felt, feel like we're well positioned, I think, coming out of the winter, given our strength and how we performed historically in the service categories. 
And given the, the emphasis that we've placed on good, better, best packages in store. 
I think we feel confident that we'll, uh, we'll be well-positioned going into the spring selling season. Got it. That's all I have. Thanks. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. 
At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. 
Thank you for joining us today, and for your continued interest and support in Monro. 
We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Have a great day. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event, you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.
