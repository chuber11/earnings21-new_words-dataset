During the course of the conference call, ADTRAN represents this. Expect to make forward-looking statements which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known. 
However, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the continued spread and extent of the impact of COVID-19 global pandemic, 
the ability of component supplies to align with customer demand, 
the successful development and market acceptance of our products, 
competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, 
component costs, manufacturing efficiencies, and other risks detailed in our annual report form 10K, for the year-end December 31st 2019. 
These risks and other uncertainties could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements which may be made during the call. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom Stanton, Chief Executive Officer of ADTRAN. Sir, please go ahead. 
Thank you, Ian. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter 2020 conference call. 
With me today is ADTRAN CFO, Mike Foliano. Following my opening remarks, Mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail, and then we'll take any questions that you may have. 
I'd like to begin by expressing our concerns and sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. 
The current times have changed the way we communicate, work, and learn, and I remain encouraged by our perseverance in the face of such adversity. 
With these challenges it is more critical than ever to connect people, communities, and businesses with each other. 
The results for our third quarter demonstrated solid execution against our plan. 
This included broad-based demand across our customer segments, regional and emergency service providers leading the way. 
We are also making great progress with tier one fiber access projects that we're now serving this year, 
and continue to have very strong momentum on mew customer acquisition across a broad base of market segments. 
From a top-line perspective, revenue for the quarter was 133.1 million, with 44.3% gross margins. 
Network solutions accounted for 87% of the revenue and 115.2, while global services contributed 17.9 million. 
During the quarter we had one 10% service provider customer and one 10% distribution partner, 
along with strong contributions from both our direct and distribution channel partners that serve the regional broadband service provider market. 
We added 38 new service provider customers during the quarter, bringing the totals to 99 for the first three quarters of 2020. 
We had new customers ranked from global tier one operators to electric co-ops, cooperatives, municipalities, cable MSO, and regional broadband providers. 
The new customer traction remains positive, reinforcing our belief that we are in the early stages of a generational communications infrastructure network upgrade cycle, driven by a confluence of favorable government, regulatory, technology, and competitive factors. 
The strength we saw during the quarter was fueled by our continued momentum with regional broadband operators who were at 60%, year over year, and 33% quarter-over-quarter. 
We were also helped really solid performance by our US tier two customers, who are up 18% year over year as they start to emerge from restructuring, and they are again investing in their network expansion. 
In Europe, our revenue from emerging alt net providers is up 76% year over year, and 20% quarter-over-quarter, and 
highlighting our growth in that region. 
For the third quarter, our fiber access and aggregation business grew 34% over the previous period, and increased 60 to six percent on a year over year basis. 
This continues to be our top sales category. 
Within fiber access, our PON OLT revenue grew 31% quarter-over-quarter, and a strong 77% year over year, 
which we believe is significantly outpacing the growth in the general market and will continue to step up on market share position in this key segment. 
We also saw strong revenue contribution from our US regional broadband service providers, growing 37% over the previous period, and 58% over the previous year, 
so broad-based growth above, across both direct and distribution channels. 
From a supply chain perspective, lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors, but our operations team took several proactive steps to mitigate logistics 
and component availability challenges to meet our customers' needs. 
In our efforts to address these needs we have increased our inventory levels 
and incurred increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedite fees. 
From an organizational perspective, the structural changes that we have implemented over the last 12 months continue to improve our operational efficiency. 
The company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through controlled and expense management, and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward. 
On the product side, we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers, in addition to selling fiber access OLTs. We are growing all those an essential gateway business. 
Residential gateway revenue grew 22% quarter-over-quarter, and a strong 64% year over year as we increased the number of OLT customers also buying our RGs by 17% year to date. 
In addition to RG attach rates, we have also focused on increasing attach rates for Mosaic software subscription services 
as we migrate customers to our Mosaic suite in our upcoming Mosaic One Virtual Control Center. 
On October 29th, the FCC began its 904 auctions for 16 billion of RDOF broadband subsidies. 
There are 386 qualified bidders that represent over 700 operators. 
Whereas the Connect America Fund was targeted to the large proce- price cap carriers providing a first right of refusal, the RDOS subsidies provide an opportunity for rural, local exchange carriers, and community broadband providers, 
such as rural electric co-ops, 
to receive 10 years of funding. 
We expect to see RDOF funding to begin to positively impact our revenues beginning in the mid 2021 
time frame. In Europe and around the world, the strategic components of 5G and fiber broadband infrastructures causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks 
and implementation policies, and are implementing policies to ban high-risk vendors from participating in these network builds. 
As a result, ADTRAN stands out as a safe, technically advanced alternative 
to those high-risk vendors as national operators look to limit, cap, or replace high-risk vendors in their network. 
2020 here brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have envisioned. How we have ri- risen to these challenges and are emerging as an even stronger and more resilient company. 
We have achieved much this far in 2020, with the material benefits just beginning to bear fruit, 
and as we start to begin more, to be more fully recognized next year. 
We have much to be excited about, including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build that or upgrade to networks with rapid adoption of our Mosaic platform 
and subscription services, and our SDX solutions. As tier-one operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of RDOF rewards, and begin, 
and being able to help regional service providers, utilities and municipalities, provide gigabit services to the communities that they serve. 
I am proud of our company and our employees for the suc- success we have seen thus far this year. 
We look forward to a strong finish to 2020, and have a bri- bright outlook as we look ahead into 2021. 
Michael will now provide an overview of financials, and following his remarks I will <inaudible> any questions that you may have. 
Thank you, Tom, and good morning to all. I will review our third quarterly <inaudible> and provide our view for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
During my report I will be referencing both GAAP and non- GAAP 
results, with respect to non- GAAP financial measures that are discussed on this call but are not presented in our earnings release. Reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures are published in a supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations web page at www.ADTRAN.com. 
For non- GAAP measures discussed on this call that are presented in the earnings release, reconciliations are contained within the release. 
The supplemental financial schedules on our webpage also present certain revenue information by segment and category, and other non- GAAP reconciliations which I will be discussing today. 
As Tom said, ADTRAN's third quarter revenue came in at $133.1 million compared to $128.7 million in the prior quarter, and $114.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. 
Breaking this down across our operating segments, 
our network solutions revenue for the third quarter was $115.2 million 
versus $111.3 million reported for Q2 of 2020, 
and $94 million in Q3 of 2019. 
Our services and support revenue in Q3 of this year was $17.9 million compared to $17.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2020, 
and $20.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. 
Across our revenue categories, access and aggregation revenue for quarter three of 2020 was $85.4 million compared to $82.8 million in the prior quarter, 
and $65.1 million in quarter three of 2019. 
Revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was $43.1 million for the quarter, 
versus $40.4 million in quarter two of 2020, 
and % 42.5 million in quarter three of 2019. 
Traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was $4.6 million compared to $5.5 million for quarter two of 2020, 
and $6.5 million for quarter three of 2019. 
Looking at our revenues geographically, 
domestic revenue for Q3 2020 was $92.8 million 
versus $84.5 million reported in quarter two of 2020, 
and $83.1 million in quarter three of 2019. 
Our international revenue for the quarter was $40.3 million compared to $44.3 million for quarter two of 2020, 
and $30.9 million in quarter three of 2019. 
For the third quarter, we had two 10% of revenue customers. Both of these were domestic customers. 
Our GAAP gross margins for the third quarter of this year 
was 44.3% as compared 41.5% last quarter, 
and 40.6% in the third quarter of 2019. 
Non- GAAP gross margin for quarter three was 44.5% as compared to 41.6% in the prior quarter, 
and 41% in the third quarter of 2019. 
The quarter-over-quarter increase in both GAAP and non- GAAP gross margins were driven by increases in volume, as well as favorable product and services mix, and lower freight-related charges in the current quarter. 
The increases in both GAAP and non- GAAP gross margins on a year over 
year basis were driven by increases in volume, as well as product mix, which were partially offset by higher freight-related charges and expedite premiums. 
Tele-operating expenses on a GAAP basis were $54.4 million for quarter three of 2020 
compared to $59.5 million reported in the prior quarter, and $62.7 million for quarter three of 2019. 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily related to market-driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense, 
as well as expense reductions in both R&D and SGNA as a result of our restructuring program initiated in 2019, 
and reduced travel expenses, offset by increases in some restructuring-related costs. 
The year-over-year decreases in operating expenses were a result of lower expenses in both R&D and SGNA, 
and lower travel-related expenses, 
partially offset by market-driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an increase in contract services cost. 
On a non- GAAP 
basis, our third quarter operating expenses were $49.4 million compared to $52.3 million in the prior quarter, 
and $59.4 million in quarter three of 2019. 
Both the non- GAAP quarter of a quarter and year-over-year decreases in operating expense were primarily driven as a result of our expense reduction efforts and lower travel-related expenses. 
Operating income on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2020 was $4.5 million 
compared to an operating loss of six million in the prior quarter, 
and an operating loss of 20.3 million reported in Q3 of 2019. 
Non- GAAP operating income for quarter three of 2020 was $9.9 million compared to an operating income 
of $1.3 million on Q2 of 2020, 
and an operating loss of $12.6 million in quarter three of 2019. 
The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year GAAP and non- GAAP profitability was driven by higher sales with favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses. 
Other income on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.5 million 
compared to other income of $8.4 million in the prior quarter, 
and other income of $1.9 million in quarter three of 2019. 
On non- GAAP other income for the quarter was $900,000 compared to other income of $5.7 million in Q2, 2020, 
and other income of $2.7 million for quarter three of 2019. 
The decreases in both GAAP and non- GAAP other income, as compared to quarter-over-quarter, were primarily market-driven, caused 
by changes in the valuation of our investment portfolio. 
The decrease in GAAP and non- GAAP other income 
on a year-over-year basis was primarily driven by realized foreign exchange losses offset by market-driven upsides in the valuation of our investment portfolio. 
The company's tax provision for the third quarter of 2020 was $600,000 
of expense as compared to an expense of $1.6 million in the prior quarter, 
and an expense of $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. 
The current quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by our domestic operations 
continue to be offset by changes in our valuation allowance. 
The tax expense in the third quarter of last year was the result of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets. 
GAAP net income for quarter three of 2020 was $5.5 million 
compared to a net income of $800,000 in the prior quarter, 
and a net loss of $46.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. 
Non- GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $7.9 million, 
as compared to an income of $1.6 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $2.8 million in quarter three of 2019. 
Earnings per share, assuming dilution on a GAAP basis, was 11 cents per share, 
as compared to two per- two cents per share last quarter and a loss of 96 cents per share in the third quarter of 2019. 
Non- GAAP earnings per share, assuming dilution for the third quarter, was 16 
cents compared to an income of four cents per share in the prior quarter 
and a loss of six cents per share in quarter three of 2019. 
Turning to the balance sheets, unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $132.2 million by quarter end, after paying $4.3 million in dividends during the quarter. 
For the quarter, we used $7 million of cash from operations. 
Net trade accounts receivable was $1.2 million at quarter end, resulting in a DSO of 69 days 
compared to 67 days in the prior quarter, 
and 73 days at the end of the third quarter, 2019. 
The variability in DSOs quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the quarter, and customer mix. 
Net inventories ended the quarter at $120.3 million compared to $106.1 million in Q2 of 
2020, and $104.9 million at the end of Q3 2019. 
The increase in our inventories for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp-ups, and strategic inventory buffer purchases 
made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic. 
We believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment. 
Looking ahead to the next quarter, 
the possible effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of components supplies to align with our customer demand, 
the book-and-ship nature of our business, the timing of the revenue associated with large projects, 
the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell, as well as the fluctuation and currency exchange rates in our international markets 
may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results. 
We expect that our fourth quarter 2020 revenue 
will be in the range of $122 million to $132 million dollars. 
After considering the projected sales mix, we expect that our fourth-quarter gross margin on a non- GAAP 
basis will be in the range of 41% to 42%. 
We also expect non- GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be between $50 and $51 million. 
And finally, we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 
on a non- GAAP basis will be a benefit at a mid-single-digit percentage rate resulting from the expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter. 
We believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2020 
will be component availability, a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises, 
ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the variability of mix and revenue associated with project roll-outs, 
the proportion of international real- revenue relative to our total revenue, 
professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets, 
the adoption rate of our broadband access platforms, 
potential changes in tax laws, currency exchange rate movements, and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels.

Now, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
Great. Thank you, Mike. Um, Ian, at this point we're ready to open up any questions people may have. 
This time, if you'd like to ask a question over the phone lines, please press star, then one, on your telephone keypad. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. 
Your first question comes from line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open. 
Thank you, good morning. Um, Tom, you mentioned that you… it sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier one in Q3, uh, when you talked about your new customer. 
Just wanted to clarify, is that the case, and if there, if it is, can you say anything about that, that win? Um, I, 
I did actually say that in my notes, but in reality we did announce it, a new tier one, at the end of September, 
um, which was for fiber extension, 
and we did pick up another tier one customer within the quarter where they expanded 
their programs with us to include, um, a different variation on the technology that we had been previously ordered, 
so there has been, but I didn't mention in any of my notes. 
Got it, that's helpful. 
And then, added, you also mentioned that you'd made good progress with your previously announced tier ones, and I guess, you know, those would include, among others, DT, 
Openreach, maybe, and the, you know, the unnamed US tier one. Is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and/or, you know, 
revenue expectations, initial revenue expectations? 
Yeah. So, um, one of those is a brand-new customer for us, as you're aware, 
and, um, all three of them are going well. Um, all three of them are at different stages of, uh, lab work. 
Um, we actually have received some POs from the new customer, but that's associated with, 
uh, you know, initial, uh, say, initial lab, uh work, and, you know, just kind of some of the software work that we're doing for them. 
So, we actually, um… So, that actually built in and shipped in the quarter. 
Um, but all three of them are going well. So, when we expect, um, material revenue contributions from them to really start in the first half, towards the tail end of the first half of next year. 
Got it. 
Um, and then, question on RDOF. 
Um, you've talked about it being kind of a mid-21 revenue opportunity. I think some of your competitors have… I'm guessing maybe it's more of a 2022. 
Um, a- any further, uh, clarification on, on your thoughts on timing? Is that sort of a 3Q, uh, ' 21, or 4Q? Any, any thoughts on that? 
Yeah, yeah, and I guess, I guess here again this is the dif- you know, when does it… It's one of those things that's gonna start, it will start slower. 
Um, you know, you have so many participants. Some of them have plans completely worked out, some of them don't have plans- Sure. at all, have just been focusing on the bidding process. 
So, um, I think you'll start seeing it in the, around the half, and then you'll start seeing it ramp up from there. 
Kind of, that's at least one more, um, Mike, um, modeling question on, um, OPEX levels. 
Um, if, if we're looking into next year… and I know you don't give guidance out there… but if we're trying to think about what an OPEX number looks like with kind of a normalized T&E level, 
any, any thoughts on how much that maybe adds back into this model as, uh, as T&E gets back to, 
you know, some kind of normalized level? 
Uh, we expect… You know, we've had a plan to get to about where we are right now, and we expect that we're gonna hold that into next year. So, I, 
I wouldn't try to model any increases. 
I think like a lot of companies everybody's rethinking the whole T&E going forward, so 
I think, I think your model going into next year should look a lot like what we're seeing at the end of this year. 
Very good. Thank you for that, Mike. I'll see the floor. 
Thank you. Your next question comes from Rod Hall, of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Hi. Uh, <inaudible>, this is <inaudible>. Uh, just 
to start off, could you, could you give us some color on 
what you're seeing in terms of broadband demand, and actually here in the US, 
and maybe take a handicap side across the tier one to the, uh… You 
know, so how you're thinking about the sustainability of the momentum, the <inaudible>? Um, 
uh… first of all, a lot of activity, and I tal- I, I touched on the growth rates in the tier three space, a lot of activity in the tier threes, 
um, which is, you know, just separate from what's going on with RDOF. 
So, um, a lot of network upgrades. We rolled out our combo card, which is, you know, the 10-gig solution, a good pickup on the combo card. 
Um, and so just a lot of activity, and, and I think a lot of it has got to do with just end user demand, 
you know, based off the environment that we're in, people understanding the r- you know, importance of the connectivity. 
Um, same thing in the tier twos. I think the tier twos, um, finally, um, 
gained past whatever financial issues they may have had, and some of them have started executing… One of them explicitly started executing on expansion plans, 
um, and I don't see that stopping; 
um, and I think the other one, actually, is kind of opened up and getting better. Um, and that includes not just those, but some of the MSOs, as well. 
So, I, I, I don't see a near-term end. In fact, I see people planning farther out 
than, um, and kind of figuring out how they're going to readjust to, you know, what may be a different work environment, 
um, in a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic, and 
I don't think it's all pandemic-driven, either. I mean, the, the activity that's going on in the tier twos has been part of their stated plan. It just got put off. 
The tier threes have been heating up for some period of time even prior to that, and we had solid growth in that space last year, as well. 
Um, and then, uh, the tier one, um, you know, we really, in the US, 
we're in the cable MSO space, and we're, with a, with large carriers, 
and, uh, with one of those large carriers here in the telco space, in relation to PON, 
and I would say the activity there is, um, I would say we've seen good activity. I wouldn't call it mid, you know, um, earth-shattering. 
I would say it's solid. 
Um, and there's more, a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year. So, I think a lot of that is just… 
I think it will pick up there. We'll probably be a year, you know, this time next year, maybe a little bit earlier than that. 
Um, does that answer your question? 
It, it does, it does. Thanks a lot. And, just for a quick followup on the gross margin. I know you mentioned about that, volumes and product mix. Maybe, um, could you expand on it so we could make, like, what <inaudible> you're talking about? 
What, what… So, it's product mix. I mean, at the end of the day it's, we're selling, um, without getting too deep into 
it, we, we're selling… PON, you know, one of the things, if you step back and look at what our business has done, 
um, we've really made the transition from copper to fiber, 
and some of the fiber components that we're selling, specifically when you're talking about LLPs and stuff, just have a richer mix. 
We also have, um, based off of international and domestic revenue mix, we have a, you know, a materials difference in those gross margin profiles. 
Those are probably the two biggest things that, that were driving gross margin difference. Makes sense. Thank you. Okay. 
Your next question comes form the line of Paul Silverstein, of Cowen. Your line is open. 
Tom, just a clarification, uh, first, before my question. 
So, the response of the previous question… O- obviously, or, I trust, non-US is lower margin than the US as a general proposition, 
but on the product piece of the revenue… I apologize if you just said this… 
the margin differential, it, it's more favorable for your fiber-based or less favorable? 
Is that, is that the distinction you're making in terms of the product mix influencing the gross margin profile, and, and what is the key difference there? On the product side? Yeah. I, 
I would say on the… I, I would say what's happening in the fiber space is we're selling, um… 
The mix towards LLPs is much higher. 
Got it. <crosstalk>. exactly. Sorry. Got it. So that, that is the key driver in the product 
mix. Uh, that's probably… You know, I don't have them listed. That's, that's, that's definitely in the top three. All right. 
We might- We have a very strong relationship. My, 
I apologize- Go ahead. Mike, of course I ask you every quarter, in 
terms of longterm market profile, you obviously just had a very good market quarter, driven by both volume and the shift to LLPs. 
Your guiding back to your traditional guidance in the low 40s for the, uh, December quarter, 
has there been any change in review about what return? Are you still looking at low 40s, gross margin profile, longer-term, low, with the benefit of volume? 
With shift to LLPS, can that be better than that? And I've got one followup question. 
Yeah, I think I was, I would say low to mid. So, somewhere right in, in that range. And you, you see variability here, and remember, in Q1 we were pretty hot. 
So, it jumps around a lot, so I try to project this by looking at what we see, 
but we are book-and-ship business, and what comes in during a quarter is a little bit hard to, to test. But, 
I believe that that 41-42 guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarter. Uh, <inaudible>, uh, 
I think the variability, also, like the thing to, to, um, maybe think about, Paul, 
and… You know, we don't have, you know, we don't know exactly what two or threes will do next year. 
If two or threes are strong, that typically helps us because not just the, the nature of what they buy, but also the software components associated with that. So, that tends to drive more strength. 
The thing that we're trying to factor in at this point in not changing the longer-term guidance 
is there is a si- real potential for material international revenue up-ticking next year, 
and whether or not the tier threes here in the US are going to keep pace with that 
is, is kind of the thing that, you know, we just have to look and see. 
But there's no doubt that the pressure, 
um, some of the pressure's been alleviated in places like Europe because of the, the stance on, on, you know, on some of the vendors there. 
But, you know, there's still a hangover effect on all of that, and the stronger that that, that business is, you'll tend to see a weakness in the gross margin. 
So, Tom, from the statement you just made it sounds like you made good progress in tier three. What percentage of total revenue are tier three today? 
Uh, we, manu- we really don't break that out. I tell you, it's very, you know, it's material. It's over… I think now it's over $50 million, 
but, um, we don't break that up. 
One quick final question, if I may. I, I know it's hard predicting the future, but the sooner you get the revenues you're expecting from these new tier one wins, 
um, how, like… do you all have any visibility as to what the margin profile is in total? 
Not asking for any specific customer, but on the tier ones, would that be consistent with current market structure? Would it be, or would it be accreted any sense? Um, it would… So, 
I'm gonna talk to you about the international gross margins, it would probably be a little accretive to international gross margins, but it would be diluted to total corporate gross margins. All right, 
I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Thank you. All right. 
And that's the mix I'm talking about: you know, how much does that pile in. That gets better over time, how much is that pile in versus where it, what's going on with the US market in tier three. Thank you again. All right. 
Your next question comes from line of Bill Gazelo, of Tyson Capital. Your line, your line is open. 
Um, thank you. A couple of different questions. First of all, 
the, the two, uh, tier ones, the one that you want and the one that, uh, with a new program that you specifically, uh, called out, 
uh, would you talk about the ramp 
and the timing for material revenues, and, um, is that different than your comment about wait in the first half of next year, uh, that you made it through a bigger comment? 
And then, second question is, is can you talk through just the, uh, European country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days, 
and what implications, if any, that has for you? 
Sure. My, let me start with the first one, 
of course, 
and it's, um, uh, the, the first half ramp that I was talking about was really around the previous SDX awards, the three customers that we talked about. 
Um, and, and really I'm talking about in totality. There is some different dates on all of those, but, um, we'll start seeing as a combination, 
we'll start seeing material revenue round the half of next year. 
Um, as far as the new ones, uh, one of them be fairly quick, but it's this, it's a, as far as seeing any revenue, um, 
I think it's… I, I don't have a good sense of timing as to when that picks up 
at this point. I think that they want to get started, and I have some very targeted areas; and then I kind of want to see how it, how it works. 
Um, the other one is very, uh, specific, and, Mike, I don't recall the date on that. I think it's third quarter of next year? Yes. Right. 
And that one is big. 
Um, it's a well-known customer to us. 
Um, they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it. Um, the current data is third quarter of next year. I will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit. 
Besides that, here I was talking about before was really the fiber piece. 
As far as to shut down that 
concern, other than… Yeah, 
it, it, it really hasn't, um… You know, we've been operating in a relatively shut-down environment anyways. From the end user demand, uh, really no difference. 
Um, and we haven't seen any near-term changes, 
um, in, in, in the way that they're operating. Where it really affects us is when you're, um, trying to meet with customers 
and, and really, you know, with the lab activity we have going on around the world right now 
it tends to impact that. 
Um, so far we've been able to maneuver around that. I'm not aware of any material delay because of the, um, the quarantine situation that we're in, 
and I, I don't expect it. I think, um, especially our bigger customers… 
Even our smaller customer, now I think about going on in Europe… 
um, have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab, work through issues, 
in many cases get into the systems themselves remotely 
and operate the way we need to operate. So, I'm not… every once in a while you hear about a week delay here or there, um, and, but that's, that's not that frequent. 
And the deployment, uh, is not impacted by stay-at-home orders. Oh, yeah, yeah. 
No change in that, and, and even in, you know, Europe, what we were seeing is, as far as, um, infrastructure in, especially with the new awards, we're talking about really material infrastructure builds to begin with, 
because we're really talking about building out a footprint, either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding footprints in many cases. 
There's, um, been no change in those plans. 
All right, thank you. And, if I may throw in one more question, uh, Latin America: what, uh, what are you seeing with, uh, your important customers, uh, down there? 
Um, so there, e- in the Caribbean we're actually doing well. We have some, um, strong, um… 
I don't, I don't want to overplay it at this point. We have some activity going on in places like Brazil, 
where they're also, of course… Honestly, you know, you know, the SPX… maybe you know the SPX 
is kind of the, um, architecture people I go to, and so there are large carriers… 
there's not a large carrier that isn't looking at a migration towards XGS, 10-gig, and if you're gonna do that you're gonna do that with a virtualized system like the SDX. 
So, there is activity going on there. Those tend to be longer-term. Um, 
we do have one traditional customer down there. Um, there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer, but there's not material change at this point. Right. 
Thank you for the time. Okay. 
Your next question comes from line of Vahadner Jar, of MKM Partners. Your line is open. Hello? Sorry, 
I was on mute. Um, I apologize if you've already addressed this, 
uh, but are you seeing any significant pull-in of orders, um, from your customers? 
Um, no. No, um, we, we did at the beginning of the pandemic. So, if you think about kind of the end of Q1, 
we saw a material increase in order activity. Um, 
I think at this point in time, uh, I, I would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is. 
I don't see any real, 
um… You, we do, on particular parts… I, I've talked a little bit about, you know, the fact that we're still having some supply issues, um, most predominantly with silicon, 
but, um, and in those cases we may really try to nail down a forecast with them 
and try to get them to reach farther out, but that, that, that's really not the norm. 
Okay, that's helpful. Uh, it's, it's, I look forward to next year, uh, with all these, uh, tier ones <inaudible>. 
How should we be thinking about your customer concentration? 
Is, is most of 
the, most of them come from- That is a really good question. 
Yeah, so, um, we are adding tier one customers, as well, 
so the good news is that there will be more tier ones to kind of spread the, the fluctuations, uh, around within, 
um, but having said that we're also adding more tier ones, so you know, you've got the, that issue. 
Um, we are adding tier threes… and I, and I use tier three, I'm really talking about alternate tiers of all different types. We're having municipalities 
on a very fast clip. Um, 
I mean, we usually have an internal announcement here, or something that goes out, and we have, like, we collect them here and there's always a municipality that's being added, 
uh, and we're adding tier three, the traditional tier three tiers at a very quick clip, I think I mentioned before. 
It's 30-something-odd customers. A large percentage of those were these alternate-type carriers. 
So, um, so if from that perspective… and, by the way, I mentioned our, our, we had a distribution partner who was actually a top, uh, 
a 10% customer. That is not typical. 
I do believe that that will be typical going forward 
because I do believe… And, and those are all being sold. Those are one of our conduits to that alternate carrier, that municipal space, tier three space. 
Um, so… and, and, and utilities. 
So, that base is growing. 
Um, now, when we get into this time next year, um, it'll still be kind of early in the cycle, some of these wins, 
but we get into this time next year, it's really how are those tier ones comparing to the growth rate within the tier three, that 
I have no doubt will be more diverse. Um, but we're adding tier ones that are, you know, at a nice clip, as well. 
So, um, but we will have more customers, which will help in that diversity. 
Um, and then one other thing I just want to add: I, 
I mentioned before the attach rates on our CPET and our RGs, and, uh, some of our new WiFi solutions is really going well, 
um, which will help add in that, that product diversity, as well. It is something we're focused on. 
That's really helpful. Thanks for the, uh, color on that. 
Uh, you know, I think one last question for me is more topical, uh, the big picture view. 
I think AT&T recently announced that they're gonna stop selling that copper-based DSL, uh, service. 
It, it seems like the executive shift towards fiber is ongoing, and they should, 
you know, um, the, probably the tier ones around the world just migrating towards fiber. Right. 
Can you talk a little bit about your competitors' positioning in, maybe like in, in the fiber? 
Does it seem like a copper that you enjoyed previously, or is it actually better, 
uh <crosstalk>? I would love to talk about that, I would love to talk about that. You know, one of the hangovers that we had gone to, 
when we've had a couple of program… really, one big program that kind of, that was copper-based that, that died and then, um, which, which caused us an issue… But really, it, it was the longevity of the copper, 
um, and the <inaudible> associated with that copper versus the fiber. 
And, I think this is the first quarter, and I'm, I'm getting ahead of <inaudible>, where you're really seeing fiber eclipse copper within our revenue. 
Um, and so, to us that's a big milestone. Um, um, and it really, because there's a lot of work to make that happen. 
Um, so, I'm, I'm happy with the, um, the shift within the company, 
um, and if you look at the R&D spend, R&D spend is predominantly fiber-based and has been for some time. So, I'm <inaudible> glad to be able to 
see the revenue kind of, 
um, mimic what it is that we've been doing internally here. 
Competitively, right now we're in a very good position. 
Um, we have, um, we've launched new flexibility and new capabilities in there, our Total Access 5000, 
uh, platform, product, which has been in the market for a long period of time. We've upgraded the switching capability, 
and we're the only… 
Well, I shouldn't say we're the only one. I've heard other people are working on one, but we are shipping, uh, combo, combo card, which is the XTS 10-gig and two, and you know, standard two-and-a-half gig within the, um, same card profile, 
um, which is unique in that customer base, 
um, and getting a lot of traction because people don't want to have to go out and replace infrastructure they don't have to. 
When I talk about the SDX, there's just nothing else out there. It's completely desegregated, it is the next-generation system that people have been talking about for five or six years 
that's actually now out in the market. We've actually shipped it to paying customers. 
It is what has been selected by pretty much every tier one that we have won in relation to PON, and we think it is, there is nothing else that will touch it right now. 
Um, there are people that kind of try, are, are reacting to it, um, but we think we have a good headway in the R&D that we've put into it. 
That's good, appreciate it. Thank you. 
Okay, thank you. Your next question from line of Ken Cevo, of Northland Capital Management. Your line is open. 
Good morning. Um, you answered a lot of my questions on that last one there, um, 
but I will say that, uh… Actually, Nokia made the same comment this quarter, with regard to- I, 
I can believe it. 
That's <crosstalk>, yeah. regarding, 
uh, fiber eclipsing and copper in their access statement. So, that would seem to be… Well, what comment were you talking about? Uh, 
I was talking about the SDX. I was talking about what I thought they were doing- Oh. talking about their dis-aggregated solution. 
Oh, okay. I see. 
Um, a little competitive intensity there… Yeah, but those successes and industry-wide, you know, trend toward copper going on, 
and so, thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter. 
I want to follow back up on the tier three comment. That, that 50 million, that's a quarterly number 
that you gave for the size of the tier three? Okay. So, well, you know, that's interesting, and- 
I, I said larger than 50. Like I said, we don't- I hear you. Obvi-… Okay. Yeah, and that, that would make it, you know, your, your largest segment, if you look at kind of international US tier three, tier two, and tier one, you know, by some distance, actually. 
And you're obviously seeing good growth there, and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments, 
most of which would seem to imply something on the order of kind of a, I don't know, 30% year-over-year decline 
among US tier ones or, you know, other parts of the business that are domestic-based. And, you know, 
I'm guessing that may be a function of the, you know, the copper programs that you reference, 
but, you know, is, is that about right, and what, what does it take to kind of… You know, will, will it take the, the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow, or, or how are you looking at that part of your business? 
Yeah, so I don't think it's tier ones. 
I think that, I think it's, I think in tier twos and tier threes on the year-over-year basis we've done good. 
I think the issue that we had last year was predominantly on a cop basis, was predominantly Telmex. 
And so, we have a large copper-based program going on with them that was tens of millions a quarter, and it just completely stopped. 
So, the, the hole that you're talking about in the North American market is Telmex, 
not, it's not the US carrier base. And that was very much a copper-based vectored, uh, VSO solution that they're rolling out. Um, 
I think I just answered your question. 
Is that? Uh, yeah, in part. And, last one for me is, uh, you know, as you think about your potential international growth, 
uh, next 
year… You know, ob- obviously should the tier threes continue to grow, you know, 60%, maybe they could keep up with that, um, rate of growth. I assume 
for planning purposes, you know, you model some slowing in that tier three growth rate despite, 
you know, our off-ramping up in some other positive drivers, 
um, just, just to begin with. 
And, you know, can we assume that, you know, from an international standpoint, you know, you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year. Good, good. 
That is a really good question that I, I don't have an answer for you today. 
So, it, it, it, for that, um… the thing about the tier threes is not just a, a, uh… Let me just say off-carriers, because it's broader than traditional tier three carriers. 
But, the thing about, um, these, these carriers is the growth rate through the year has been increasing, 
and I, I don't see a change in next year. So, you know, you're going to have two quarters of growth before these, you know, the, 
the, um, really that one mammoth tier one in, in Europe 
that is gonna start, that's gonna be all of 
the mental… and we're about to eclipse it. Now there are, there are other activities going on. 
There's, um, a process going on in Australia, uh, carriers like, um, Orange who we announced an award with. Um, 
Vodafone, all of these… Telefonica, 
um, which is, of course, not just in Europe, but in Brazil, all of those have got processes that are in place 
or are, uh, where they're coming towards a decision. But, those will carry, those are really… 
If you think they don't get awarded until next year, they're a year away from that. 
So, the real mammoth meeting for mental piece was, um, a new customer force that, that's, um, deploying the SDX next year. 
And, it, it'll just be starting around the half. 
So, I could absolutely envision next year where, um, the tier threes actually eclipse it on a pure growth knowledge basis, 
um, but I, but I don't know that. I don't know that for a fact. You know, we'll have to get into the year and really see. 
RDOF will start around the turn of the second half, 
but if… You know, really for it to be material that's gonna take some time, so you know, that'll just be… I, 
I don't see that as this huge kind of wave of things coming in the second half of next year. I think it just starts and starts to ramp up from there. Thanks, 
I appreciate all that color. <crosstalk> these alt carriers, yeah, these alt carriers are, are, you know, if they keep the momentum they have right now then, you know, they're, um, US could be stronger. 
Um, okay, so thank you very much for joining us today. Um, I appreciate, uh, your interest and look forward to the call on our next quarter. 
This concludes today's conference call. You made now disconnect. <silence>
