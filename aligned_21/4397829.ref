It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark. 
Thank you, Janet. And good morning and happy new year to you all. 
It's hard to believe it's been a full year since my first earnings call as CEO of Bed Bath and Beyond. And what an exceptional year of change it has been. 
At that time, I clearly stated that fiscal 2019 third quarter results were unsatisfactory and underscored the imperative to change. 
I declared that we must respond to the challenges we face as a business, 
including pressured sales and profitability and reconstruct a modern durable model for longterm profitable growth. 
Today, we stand in a very different position as a company than we did just a mere 12 months ago. 
Firstly, we continue to execute on our digital first on the always strategy and they've delivered a 
second consecutive quarter of comparable sales and EBITDA growth through strong margin management. 
Secondly, responding to our customers wherever they needed us, growing out Omni capabilities to accelerate profitable digital growth and grow our customer base. 
Thirdly, we continue to strengthen an already strong balance sheet and remain focused on ensuring liquidity, optimizing costs 
and significantly reducing debt while driving positive cash flow generation. 
And while we drive overall business results, we also completed our non-core bene monetization plan 
with the final transaction set to close in our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. 
These efforts will help fund our transformation and put us in a position to start fiscal 2021 with a more cohesive set of core businesses. 
Our favorable sales results are also starting to be reflected in market share data. 
Month by month, we have been minimizing our share differentials versus the market 
and encouragingly in the most recent MPD data for October and November, 
we achieved market share gains in the bed category, with improving trends in both bath and kitchen categories. 
We expect to see continued improvement in market share trend as our strategy continues to take hold. 
Additionally, we continue to show strong market share strength in wedding registry, 
where we believe we are very well positioned as a market leader when we get back to celebrating important life moments, such as getting married. 
All of this has been achieved this quarter, despite the significant headwinds of COVID-19. 
During our call today Gustavo, Arnal Chief Financial Officer and treasurer will review at the quarter financial results, 
and then provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2021. 
Then Rafeh Masood, Chief Digital Officer will speak about the quarter from a digital first and customer perspective. 
And then John Hartmann, Chief Operating Officer and President buybuy BABY will do the same for our operations, 
including the progress on our plans to close underperforming stores and invest in our remaining portfolio. 
We will then take questions. Gustavo? Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. 
Today, I will cover two key topics. 
First, I will provide perspective on the performance of our third quarter, as well as on December sales trends. 
And then I will provide visibility on the current fourth quarter, as well as on our outlook for fiscal year 2021. 
To begin, it is important to note that our first qua- first quarter runs through September, October, and November. 
And consistent with last year, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend was the last date of the period. 
We delivered strong results despite extensive and widely reported COVID related headwind. 
These included lower foot traffic trends, shipping capacity constraints and much higher freight costs. 
Further, during a challenging holiday period, we strengthened our commercial plans to drive significant digital demand 
while remaining focused on delivering gross margin expansion. 
Positive comp sales growth was led by our core Bed Bath and Beyond banner, which was up 5%. 
It was fueled by exponential digital growth of 94%, which more than offset stores declined of 14%. 
Growth was healthy, and broad base across five key destination categories, which grew 11% and represented two-thirds of revenue. 
Total enterprise comparable sales grew 2%, also driven by strong digital comp growth up 77%. 
As you'll hear from John in a few minutes, COVID related headwind, disproportionally impacted store sales in our baby business during the quarter, 
yet encouragingly, we saw a return to growth in December following some key interventions. 
The strength of our digital growth has been powered by the investments we have made in Omni capability, 
including BOPUS, curbside pickup and same day delivery, which are all completely new this year. 
BOPUS orders represented 16% of total digital sales in the quarter. 
These service offerings provide ease and convenience and allow us to further gain trust from our customers, 
including the approximately seven million new online customers gained this year. 
Our digital capabilities are becoming a key driver of results. 
Net sales were 2.6 billion 
an expected reduction of 5%, primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures and the continuation of our Bed Bath and Beyond store network optimization initiatives. 
This has been a holiday season like no other, 
as outlined by third party data sources, including sense or MADEC and Adobe analytics, 
market wide black Friday in-store traffic was down by over 50%. And online spending was up 22%. 
Similarly, for the six week holiday period market-wide in-store traffics fell between 34 and 36%. 
We performed strongly against this reported trends. 
During the competitive intense five day holiday sales period from Thanksgiving through cyber Monday 
overall comp sales demand for our core U.S Bed Bath and Beyond banner was up double digits versus last year, 
and delivered digital comp sales growth of approximately 69% more than outfitting store comp sales decline of 24%. 
And during the six week holiday sales period from November 16 to December 27, our total enterprise comp sales grew low single digits, 
led by significant digital growth of more than 90%, which more than offset store com sales declined more than 20%. 
I will now continue with our third quarter financial results. 
On a gap basis, including the non-cash loss from banners divested, or held for sale, we reported a net loss per diluted share of 61 cents. 
Our gaping sales include approximately $86 million from favorable impacts, which are excluded from adjusted results to provide better perspective on the underlying performance of our business. 
These include special items such as losses on the sales of businesses, including cost plus world market, 
which has helped for sale, as well on non-cash charges for the impairment of certain long lived assets. Plus restructuring and transformation expenses. 
Adjusted gross margin increased 310 basis points to 35.4%. 
This expansion was driven by 
180 basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense, including data-driven coupon optimization. 
120 basis points of favorable product mix from higher margin categories, such as bedding and bath. 
And 210 basis points of leverage from distribution and fulfillment costs. 
These benefits were partially offset by 200 basis points impact from channel mix due to the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus the prior year. 
This impact also includes around 80 basis points from higher shipping expense associated with industry-wide outbound freight rate increases, 
particularly in the latter part of the quarter. 
The significant year over year improvement and our adjusted gross margin 
reflect the management themes focus on driving the components of margin while delivering explanation growth in digital. 
SGNA expense declined $41 million versus the prior year, 
driven primarily by lower payroll related expenses, including savings from our comprehensive restructuring actions earlier in the year. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 168% to $121 million, which is almost three times higher than the prior year period. 
This was driven by digital sales growth coupled with gross margin expansion. 
Once again, this results demonstrate that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern durable business model are working. 
Turning now to some cashflow and balance sheet <inaudible> statements. We unlocked $244 million in positive cashflow generation, cashflow 
from investments was $200 million positive, that it included proceeds from non-core asset monetization, net of <inaudible>. 
Operating cash flow of $44 million was also positive, in spite of seasonal dynamics. 
We continue to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending inventories of 1.8 billion. 
On a sequential basis, inventories were 13% lower versus the second quarter and 30% lower than last year. 
This was primarily due to the impact from banner divestitures, including seasonal inventory purchases for the holiday selling period. 
We are tracking at a faster pace to deliver our previously stated 2021 goal of $1 billion in inventory reduction at retail compared to 2019. 
Our capital expenditures in the quarter were only 38 million. 
That said, we have plans to significantly ramp up our cap expanding, starting in fiscal ' 
21 in support of our digital first, <inaudible> transformation. 
During the third quarter, we also improve our gross debt balance 
with a reduction in operating lease liability of about half a billion dollars, from non-core banner divestitures and store closures. 
Taken together with a half a billion in debt reduction, we achieved in the second quarter, 
we have reduced total gross debt by about $1 billion so far this year, 
a reduction of about 25%. 
We remain in a strong net cash position with an ending cash and investment balance of 1.5 billion. 
This is in line with the balance at the end of the second quarter, even after returning cash to shareholders in the form of accelerated share repurchases. 
We have also maintained a strong liquidity of $2.2 billion, including our ABL. 
So capitalizing on this strong financial position, we launched the 225 million accelerated share repurchase in late October, 
and in December, in conjunction with the announcement of a definitive agreement to divest cost plus world market, 
we reported plans for a second ASR in the amount of 150 million. 
These two programs totaling 375 million 
are expected to be completed on or before the end of our fiscal fourth quarter next month in February. 
And will result in a reduction of our shares outstanding of approximately 15% at current stock price levels. 
Our authorized level for share repurchase at this early stage of the planning period is now up to $825 million over the next three years. 
These actions reflect our balanced capital allocation principles, strong liquidity and competency in our strategic growth plan. 
In summary, our third quarter performance shows consistent execution of our strategy, which drives sales and EBITDA growth, 
coupled with strong cash flow generation and the reinitiation of capital return to shareholders. 
Now moving on to our outlook, 
I will start with some direction of <inaudible> on our expectations for Q4 and then provide perspective from fiscal 2021. 
It has been widely reported that COVID-19 related headwinds, continue to impact the retail industry. 
In this context, we will not be providing specific sales and earnings guidance for the current fourth quarter. 
That's it. We feel positive about the parts of the business we can control and expect to deliver year, year adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in Q4. 
This, despite low stores shopping and shipping constraints, accompanied by higher freight costs. 
In terms of the top line, comp sales are expected to be approximately in line with last year, 
we expect consistent strength in digital to be tampered by COVID related headwinds, impacting stores. 
December sales show positive total enterprise comparable growth, including continued strength across key destination categories. 
Importantly, we're planning for a double digit on favorable impact on Q4 total net sales versus last year. 
Even the divested banners and the ongoing store optimization initiative. 
In terms of growth margin, 
in spite of the anticipated drag from significant freight cost increases in Q4 we're driving cost optimization actions to manage the impact of these pressures. 
So we expect gross margin to be above in line with the same period last year. 
Again, we expect to deliver a year on year adjusted EBITDA margin increase in Q4 with absolute EBITDA figures in line with the prior year. 
Now I'll turn to fiscal 2021. Our initial outlook included fiscal year 2019 as the base 
year, at the time, our portfolio banner review was still underway. 
We had already divested four banners, but we did not have a signed deal for cost plus world market yet. 
Now we do. And we expect this transaction to close imminently. 
Today we're providing additional visibility on the significant we shape of our P&L, as a result of these divestitures and the closure of under performing stores. 
Our significant portfolio transformation will lead to fewer better performing stores, and will include a healthier core revenue base 
with a larger proportion of a faster growing digital business. 
We're now tightening our projected fiscal 21 revenue range to approximately eight to 8.2 billion. 
Looking at quarters, starting with the first quarter, which will not be on a comp basis. 
We expect to recapture the lost sales opportunities from the store closures in 2020 due to COVID-19. 
During quarters two through four, which will be on a comp basis, we expect to sustain comparable sales levels in relation to the solid console space of fiscal 2020. 
Our sales forecast for financial planning purposes assumes total enterprise comparable sales to be in line with fiscal 2020. 
We are reiterating our expectation for adjusted gross margin of approximately 35%, 
which represents a more than 200 basis point improvement versus proforma 2019. 
We are enhancing adjusted fiscal year 2021 EBITDA to a range of between 500 to $525 million. 
This represents a 20% increase from the proforma 2019 EBITDA base of 425 million. 
The drivers of the adjusted EBITDA range are consistent with the ones we have previously shared, 
including cost savings from planned store closures, product sourcing, and restructuring actions, 
and the impact from re investments and channel shift and shipping costs. 
And as I said earlier, we have assumed comp sales to be in line versus fiscal 2020 for modeling purposes, 
as we're not requiring sales growth to deliver the higher EBITDA range. 
But needless to say, we will strive for continued top line growth in a highly competitive environment. 
Our performance to date gives us confidence in our longer term goal of achieving between 850 and $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA by fiscal 2023. 
Importantly, our portfolio transformation 
coupled with store closures is driving significant balance sheet improvement to <inaudible> reduction of $1 billion. 
This would resolve in a gross debt to EBITDA ratio below 3.5 times, which puts us well on our way to our midterm goal or below three times. 
We have a strategic and disciplined pathway for driving sales and margin growth, 
generating cash and investing our business plan to drive shareholder value creation. And it is working. 
I will now turn the call over to Rafeh Masood, Chief Digital Officer. Rafeh? 
Thank you, Gustavo. With COVID as a headwind to our store traffic, we have stepped up our strategy as an Omni-always retailer, and it is paying off. 
During the third quarter, we delivered digital growth of 77%, our third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 75% this year. 
Our Bed Bath and Beyond banner alone, posted digital com sales up 94%, almost doubling last year sale. 
With this momentum and based on current trends, we are on track to exceed our digital sales goal of $3 billion by the end of fiscal 2020. 
We have laid out a transformation plan to unlock the potential of our Omni-always growth strategy by elevating customer experience, 
building out our Omni capabilities and evolving to a digital first culture. 
The goal of this initiative is to meet customers wherever they are. I'm pleased to report that the company is now incredibly equipped to do that. 
The benefits are coming through not only in digital sales growth, but also in customer metrics. 
During the quarter, we gained 2.2 million new online customers of which the bed bath banner alone added 1.8 million. 
Year to date we have gained approximately seven million new online customers. 
And not only are we attracting new customers, we're seeing them return at a higher rate than ever before. 
In the third quarter, 21% of our Bed Bath and Beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about 16% versus last year. 
So what's driving the sticky customer experience for online customers. 
We believe the true hero for us is buy online pickup in store. 
Since introducing BOPUS and contact lists curbside pickup services earlier this year, we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers. 
In the third quarter, approximately 1.2 million customers placed a BOPUS order representing 16% of our total digital revenue. 
In the Bed Bath and Beyond banner, BOPUS orders represented 15% of total digital sales and 17% of total digital orders. 
And 60% of our BOPUS orders are, were ready within 30 minutes surpassing our two-hour promise. 
This fast and convenient experience has earned Bed Bath and Beyond a net promoter score of 80% for our BOPUS services. 
Up from 49% in May, when we first introduced the service. 
Our stores are now a competitive advantage of our Omni strategy, fulfilling a total of 36% of all digital sales in the third quarter. 
This muscle was not in place last year. 
Now we're connecting our stores with our online platforms and the power of Omni is enabling us to better serve our customers however they choose to shop. 
We know Omni-channel is the future of retail, and we are making the right investments that are resonating with our customers. 
The fast paced transformation of our digital offering 
and elevated customer experience has resulted in a 25% lift in our online conversion rate for the third quarter, as compared to the pre prior year. 
Key drivers of the increase include, first, the relaunch of our mobile sites and mobile apps. 
We implemented a new framework of an optimized experience that drove a 33% increase in conversion, 
and mobile sales growth of 107% versus the prior year period. 
During the five day holiday shopping period from Thanksgiving to cyber Monday, our mobile homepage loaded 74% faster than the same period last year. 
We also relaunched Bed Bath and Beyond and buybuy BABY mobile apps resulting in over 800,000 downloads this quarter. 
Our Bed Bath and Beyond mobile app was launched over 15 million times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled versus last year. 
We have also seen the rate of app uninstalls continue to improve, further underscoring the stickiness of our customer experience. 
Second, in order to ensure that we were firing on all cylinders going into the holiday season, 
we launched same day delivery on Bed Bath and Beyond.com and buybuy BABY.com to provide our customers another convenient and cost effective way to shop. 
This service was introduced in Q3 results are preliminary, but we have seen hundreds of thousands of our customers take advantage of this new convenient way to shop. 
We also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of Bed Bath and Beyond and buybuy BABY stores on shipped and Instacart, 
with both marketplaces, each reaching more than 80% of U.S households. 
Harmon Face Values was recently added to the Instacart marketplace. And we are pleased with its initial launch and continued positive response from customers on this platform. 
Third, we implemented over a hundred improvements to make our shopping experience more convenient and easier to use, 
including a faster checkout process and due payment type options. 
This includes buy now pay later options like Afterpay and PayPal's PayInfo, as well as extending Apple Pay from store only to our mobile apps. 
During the quarter, 
we also focused on optimizing our experiences and speed to place orders on our site, making it even easier, convenient, and faster for our customers to shop with us. 
Again, each of these initiatives were geared to customers with the goal of meeting them where they are and creating multiple options for payment and delivery. 
As we look at our digital program holistically, is a true revolution from where we were a year ago and has become part of the fabric of how we operate at Bed Bath and Beyond. 
The customer environment is rapidly changing and we are there to greet them at every turn, 
through our enhanced services, speed and focus on engagement, our customer perception continues to improve. 
Our Omni-always strategy is working and was a key driver of our third quarter sales performance. 
Our strength in digital has more than compensated for the headwinds of the pandemic 
and has fast track our transformation, as we moved into the important holiday season this year and sets us up for success moving forward. 
We have delivered an elevated customer experience, launched meaningful capabilities and pivoted digital from a laggard tactic to a strategic asset and a profitable growth engine that has delivered another strong quarter of growth. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hartmann, our Chief Operating Officer and President of buybuy BABY. 
John? Thank you, Rafeh. We made exceptional progress across our operations in the third quarter, 
specifically as it relates to our supply chain reformation, optimizing our real estate portfolio in advancing our technology roadmap. 
Modernizing our business remains a key focus 
and we are evolving our store formats, our distribution and fulfillment capabilities 
alongside leveraging our unique data and insights to meet the changing needs of our customers 
and deliver an exceptional shopping experience. 
I'll start with supply chain, while we remained focused on mid to long-term capability building, we made very substantial pivots in the third quarter, 
as Rafeh mentioned, our stores fulfilled 36% of total digital sales in the third quarter. 
Well, last year we didn't have BOPUS curbside pickup or same-day delivery in our offering. 
Not only do these new capabilities provide ease and convenience to our customers, 
they also help us to partially alleviate current shipping constraints and additional cost pressures in the supply chain. 
During the quarter, we also added a secondary national carrier in several regional parcel delivery carriers, 
which helped to offset an over 20% cost increase from our primary carrier FedEx. 
And importantly, we continue to focus intently on the health and safety of our associates working in our fulfillment centers 
by instituting daily COVID cleaning procedures in our facilities. 
Concurrently, we launched an evaluation of a number of potential third party logistics providers who will partner with us to establish new regional distribution centers, 
and to manage the efficient flow of domestic distribution. 
We anticipate that using third party logistics operators will also provide increased financial flexibility and reduce capital expense. 
This is the cornerstone of the transformation of our supply chain network 
and will increase our capacity for fast store replenishment while continuing to leverage the store network for Omni fulfillment. 
By making the replenishment process more efficient, our store teams will have a more predictable and faster flow of the products we sell most. 
In turn, this will allow us to meet the increased demand for BOPUS curbside and same-day delivery services. 
While also reducing the time our store team spend managing deliveries 
so they can spend more time with our customers. 
Also, core to our transformation is technology. 
And we are taking a disciplined approach to our investments in building a technology infrastructure that will enable us to personalize the service for our customers, 
improve our ability to predict and meet demand, make it easier to collaborate across teams and drive down inefficiencies in our business. 
Over the next three years, we plan to invest approximately $250 million to modernize the application and technology landscape to a cloud empowered foundation. 
Last quarter, we talked about our expanded multi-year partnership with Google and Deloitte to enhance our Omni-channel shopping experience. 
This quarter, we defined our plans for a new ERP system. 
We will also be pursuing a product life cycle management solution in support of our own brand initiative 
and an inventory management capability to improve inventory productivity. 
These plans will all start in 2021 and our foundational parts of building out our technology infrastructure. 
In other activities, we are making significant progress toward the targets we have previously highlighted regarding our real estate portfolio, 
including our store network optimization and store remodel plans. 
Let me start with our network optimization program, which is designed to not only ensure our stores remain a strategic asset for us, 
but also to ensure that we have them in the right locations to deliver more sustainable sales growth, improved margins, and greater cash generation. 
As part of this work, we are well underway in the process of closing approximately 200 under performing Bed Bath and Beyond stores by the end of fiscal 2021. 
Initially, we identified about one third of these stores to be closed by the end of the fiscal year. 
We have since accelerated the pace of targeted store closings this year from 70 to about 120 stores with certain stores closing earlier than planned due to having efficiently sold down store inventory during the closing process. 
In the third quarter, we closed four Bed Bath and Beyond stores. 
And in December we closed another 75 and we are currently liquidating an additional 42 stores. 
We are very please with our progress to date and completing the store closure program during fiscal 2021 remains a priority. 
Turning to our Bed Bath and Beyond store remodel program. We have advanced from the initial prototype phase to active iteration within 10 stores in our Houston markets. 
These proof of concept stores highlight our destination categories, bed, bath, kitchen, and storage. 
We expect to complete this phase of the remodel program by the end of February 2021. 
Additionally, we will take all the visual signage enhancements and immediately apply them to the entire fleet of stores on the same timeline. 
Next, we will take our learnings from Houston and move into our first expanded wave of renovations in 2021, which includes approximately 150 stores. 
In total, our store remodel plan involves $250 million of investment over the next three years and touches over 450 stores 
representing roughly 60% of our revenue. 
In addition, we'll utilize strategic sourcing methods to procure necessary remodel components at a lower cost and leverage economies of scale with this overall initiative. 
Instead of the legacy store by store one-off approach of the past, 
we have established a unified planning process to identify, prioritize, and sequence all aspects of the remodels. 
These store remodels and our network optimization plans are crucial steps in building an Omni-always organization that serves our digital first customers with an intuitive and modern shopping experience. 
We look forward to reporting our progress along the way. 
Before closing, let me provide some perspective on the quarterly performance of buybuy BABY, which 
represented approximately 10% of total enterprise reported sales in the third quarter. 
This included strong growth in digital of approximately 40%, which represented more than half of the sales in the quarter. 
It remains a challenging environment for our new or soon to be parents who are particularly vulnerable to the perceived challenges associated with in-store shopping due to COVID-19. 
As a result, we saw a disproportionate level of store traffic declines from our baby customers this quarter, then across our other banners. 
These COVID related headwinds have also a short-term impact on the registry component of our business, which is highly correlated to in-store activity. 
While we have seen overall growth in the registry, digital registries created online, currently tend to carry a lower average value than those created in store. 
Enhancements to the digital registry experience are addressing this opportunity to assist our customers and building more well-rounded baby wishlist. 
COVID headwinds have also constrained inventory levels in certain of our key categories, such as furniture and gear as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain. 
We have made key pivots here, including sharing improved forecasts with our vendor partners well into 2021. 
So, as consumer behavior shifted, we pivoted and leaned into digital to create an enhanced online experience with a more convenient suite of checkout options, including Afterpay, PayInfo, and Apple Pay. 
We also upgraded and relaunched our buybuy BABY app in November strengthening the choices we offer our customers who connect with us digitally. 
Year to date we have gained nearly two million U.S. online customers, an increase of 46% over the last year, 
including more than a half a million new online customers in the third quarter. 
In all, nearly two thirds of our baby customers only shopped online this quarter. 
As young parents take safety into consideration this year, our new Omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are with BOPUS 
curbside in same day delivery services. 
Digital orders fulfilled by our baby stores represented a significant portion of total orders in the quarter, 
with BOPUS orders representing approximately half of all store fulfilled orders. 
While the holiday period is traditionally not a big baby season except for gift giving or needs of families getting ready for, or just having had a baby. 
We did see strong digital demand comp growth of 49% year over year during the five day holiday period from Thanksgiving to cyber Monday. 
This growth was driven by top performing baby categories, including toys, playroom furniture, and apparel. 
These positive sales and category trends accelerated in December. 
We believe in this business and we are now ready to double down on and significantly invest in expanding sales and margin and growing our market share. 
We plan to accelerate our growth in baby over the next several years, including introducing own brands 
aging up into toddler in younger children, as well as expanding into categories like toys and educational, as well as furniture. 
Enhancing our registry and leading with new partnerships. 
We will also invest scale our footprint nationwide with about 50 new stores over the next three years. 
Fiscal 2021, will mark the true beginning of the transformation of this banner. As we execute our three-year plan and unlock the value of this brand. 
Earlier this week, we announced the appointment of Patty Wu, as Senior Vice President and General Manager for buybuy BABY. 
Patty's exceptional experience will help accelerate our plans and drive meaningful change. We look forward to sharing our progress in future conference calls. 
Mark, I'll turn it back over to you now for closing remarks. 
Thank you, John. A strong performance this quarter across several key performance metrics, 
including positive comp sales growth, gross margin expansion, 
positive cash flow generation 
and growth debt reduction is evidence of our transformation taking hold, even despite the significant headwinds of a global pandemic. 
Yet, what I saw beyond the numbers was even more impressive. Our team was planning, modifying, and executing, in an aligned and disciplined way like never before. 
They were learning and improving in real time as the customer and conditions changed showing true agility in motion. 
These newly acquired muscles extended from product and price through messaging and digital expression to south floor and distribution center. 
I'm truly grateful to all our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate that strengths and opportunities as the new Bed Bath and Beyond team. 
And what has been an exceptional year of change so far, we still continue to make bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate, and restore our company. 
Simply put we are delivering more than what we said we would do. 
In simple, we put a team in place that would have the right talent and expertise to execute our new vision and inject new ideas. 
And that we would create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision-making. And we've done that. 
We said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customer to shop with us. And we are doing that. 
We said, we reset our cost structure, modernize for growth and refine our organization. And we've done that and continue to focus on gross margin improvement. 
We said we had a clear mandate to reestablish our authority as the preferred Omni-channel home destination, 
and that we would use customer inspired and market insights to develop a new customer value proposition. And we're doing that. 
We said we would evaluate our asset base and how best to optimize its value for the business on a go-forward basis. And we have done that. 
And finally, we said our mission is to ensure the Bed Bath and Beyond is well positioned to long-term success. And we're doing just that. 
I'm proud of what our teams have achieved and I thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to the long-term success of our company. 
Our results, it's quite a setup from base from which we will continue to drive out bold transformation, 
and seek to deliver on our three-year strategic and financial goals shared at our 2020 investor day. 
We have many bold and exciting plans to fiscal 2021, such as launching your own brands that will help differentiate us in our key destination category. 
Remodeling, approximately 150 stores under our store network optimization program. 
Introducing new and unique digital services designed to enhance our Omni-always experience. 
Modernizing our technology and operation and reinventing our supply chain for the future. 
Investing to further strengthen our buybuy BABY and Harmon <inaudible>, and continuing to unlock and deliver shareholder value. 
In a year like no other, we are embracing and driving transformative change, staying curious, and bold and so much more. 
I'm proud of the commitment our team has shown and what we have achieved together. With that, we will now take your questions. 
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star then one on your touch tone phone. If you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the pound sign or the hash key. 
There'll be a delay before the first question is announced. If you're using a speaker phone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. 
Once again, if you have a question, press star, then one on your touch tone phone. 
And our first question is from Kurt O'Neal from Bank of America. Uh, good morning. Thanks very much for, for taking my questions. 
Um, yeah. So the first one is, um, you know, understand how, you know, very constrained shipping and freight was, uh, an issue for, on our holiday margins. 
But, yeah, how long do you think this pressure carries into ' 21? 
It sounds like at least for the full year, 
uh, you don't think it's an issue since you're still targeting uh, 20 I'm sorry, um, 35% gross margins in, in ' 21, and then just have a fall after that. 
Yeah, good morning too. Thanks. Look, uh, we, you know, we know that the blood pressure, you know, across retail is here to stay and we've built that into our future plans. 
Uh, so we see that our margin stability and the offset. So we've created, uh, currently in the proof of concept of those over both Q2 and Q3 of this year. 
Um, really standards in good stead to deliver that 35% margin. So we feel really comfortable around that. 
Okay. Um, so maybe just, you know, again for 
your March, um, maybe give this a quick update on some of the uh, big merchandising initiatives you guys have outlined in October, um, and <inaudible> such as, you know, lower sourcing 
vendor costs and then, you know, starting to roll out improved and, or merchandi- or more exclusive product and you know, how much of an impact that'll make 
in ' 21, or we'll just had to think about the cadence of those things 
uh, you know, in 2021. 
Yeah. I mean the good news is that we've already built a firm foundation with these results. Now, the actions and trends we add here in terms of margin bought across the board are really substantial and sustainable. 
And then we're going to add into those, the rolling benefits as you outlined, good. 
So the sourcing benefits that we've undertaken throughout 2020, uh, are really going to be evidenced in first quarter onwards in 2021. 
Uh, and then we begin in March with the rollout of our own brands and we're going to be sharing 
more clothes in the pagination of that flow throughout the year. Several brands will be launched. 
But the key news is that in the first half of 2021, 
we'll be addressing the majority of our big key categories. We're already seeing strength and growth 
in reinventing those with own brands. And also the introduction of opening price point items and are arranged there, which has been a huge missing 
part of our equation in terms of being truly competitive in the marketplace 
to build our authority. 
So the step changes, um, the, the, the consistent management of promotions, 
um, the mix management. Now we're going to lay in the incremental benefits of sourcing an own brand. 
Uh, so we're excited about that progression in 2021. 
Our next question is from <inaudible> Morgan Stanley. 
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. 
Can you talk about, um, where your expectations were a couple of months ago 
for the fourth quarter in sales and now. And, and I know the outlook for next year in bed, 
uh, flattish, um, does that change now that you're going to be lapping at something that may be potentially weaker in this year's fourth quarter? 
Yeah, I think <inaudible> again, we had robust plans for Q4 of this year. 
Um, we feel good about how we're executing on those, but there's no doubt that the COVID headwinds and the impact that that has had on foot traffic and, uh, overall consumer confidence, 
is something that we've had to factor into our plan tents while we talked about the agility about saying through Q3 and now Q4 to respond to those challenges. 
And so we think we've met those in, in, uh, you know, what has been the table on 
time, and we really look forward to the lapping those next year in a very different way. 
Okay. Thanks for that. 
And then my follow-up, can you talk about, um, Q4, uh, you mentioned the frayed headwinds and, but offset by some optimization, um, on I think the gross margin 
and in terms of promotion and pricing, 
can you talk about the promotional environment? 
Um, and then, you know, thinking about, um, how much margin opportunity there still is, I think for next year's, um, guidance revision, 
that is, it looks like it's more of a function of the margin changing as opposed to the top line, just to confirm. 
Yeah, I think that, you know, we would stress that we did not become more promotional, uh, during the quarter in Q3 
or in Q4. 
We've actually reshaped and re-engineered our promotional activity we had opportunity to do so, uh, but that's really paying dividends in terms of generating gross margin 
and helping to create that balance and exceeding equation on the, on the margin, uh, differentials from, uh, shipping and freight. 
Um, so we're less promotional, we're more focused on reg price. Um, we're winning customers and we see that progressing forward 
as Gustavo had outlined. 
Uh, we're not putting pressure on the, uh, the working sales plan 
to generate, uh, even, uh, we believe that we can do that through a number of the different initiatives we have, 
uh, through cost control and definitely margin growth in 2021, as we outlined in that three day 
plan, our three-year plan, sorry. 
Our next question is from Bobby Griffin from Raymond 
James. Morning, buddy. Um, thanks for taking my questions. 
I guess we'll start with Mark. The first thing I wanted to talk about was, you know, looking at the range for next year, it's a fairly tight range of 500 to 525 million EBITDA, 
you know, was still a lot of uncertainty out there. So can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you see in the business now that really gives you confidence and tightening that range up. 
And as a second part of that, 
um, where, what, what could be the driver that would cause that range to underperform? Is it sales? Is it margin? What, what gives you the most, uh, concern there? 
Hi, Bobby, Gustavo here. So definitely there's still a lot of uncertainties as we look forward, but we feel very confident in our plans. 
We have clarity on the drivers of gross margin expansion, which is why we are reiterating a gross margin of 35% 
next year. In spite of the reason headwinds that we're seeing on freight costs, 
as Mark mentioned, we're being more data-driven in managing our promotion and our mix. 
And with that, we will offset it. 
It is a tighter range than the why, the one we provided on investor's day, but we set that as 
we completed the portfolio work, the monetization of non-core assets, we would tighten that. 
And that's what we're coming, uh, for, to you right now. 
Uh, on your question of what can throw us off. It's not sales. We are prudently assuming for financial planning purposes that we would have 
sales, comp sales in line with prior year and <inaudible> buy with that we would deliver significant EBITDA growth. 
Yeah, Bobby, just, I would just add that. I think that the plan we're placing, is a responsible plan based on changing circumstances in the market, 
any threat or a consent would really be uh, a macro market, uh, issue, not an internally caused issue. 
And again, I think 2020 is exemplified, uh, how, you know, everyone gets affected by those things. So we are monitoring things very carefully by working by quarter, 
we feel our pla- plan is responsible and achievable. 
Uh, and we're looking forward to delivering that. All right. 
Thank you. I guess my second question would be for the December commentary, you mentioned that the enterprise did show some growth for comparable sales, 
but then I guess for the entire quarter, you're, you're kind of calling for flattish versus last year or in line of believes that we're wording. 
Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what is going in there is something popped up in the last couple weeks, has given you concern or is that just a little bit of, 
you know, a function of being conservative, given the level of uncertainty that's still out there in the world? 
Yeah. Bang on there. Um, it's definitely around, we've seen, um, positive signs in December 
remembering that our fourth quarter is December, January, February. 
We still had two, four months to complete this process. There's a lot going on on the world 
and we want to make sure that we're being responsible in our planning. And, uh, you know, we look forward to kind of sharing more in the fourth quarter. 
Thank you very much. Best of luck. Once again, if you have a question, press star, then one on your touch tone phone. 
And our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. 
Thanks. Good morning guys. Um, so my first question is a follow-up as you think about, you know, you talk about, you know, things evolving and changing, as you thought about, um, you know, your, your ' 21 plan. 
Is it fair to say that, uh, 
COVID changed in terms of the recent surge? Are you assuming that this will sort of lasts longer 
until we actually get to a vaccine? So what was the change there? And also was the other change, uh, the freight costs. 
I mean, presumably as a holiday, the volume surcharges 
should come down as you get into a more normalized sort of, uh, shipping environment here. So, uh, is there something structural within that freight that you're- that 
you're assuming sticks around? 
Yeah, I think that, I think it's prudent to, to think about an environment. I mean, we saw an acceleration of change in behavior between, um, 
you know, our, our Q2 in September, October results, and then November results based on COVID. 
And based on foot traffic to stores, uh, customers being concerned around what the future held and real uncertainty in the market really began around the election period. 
So we a big prudent in thinking through, you know, with the vaccine rollout, 
it's still underway. It's still very early. We want to be able to monitor that and its impacts. 
Uh, we haven't affected anything in terms of, uh, seamless checks and their impact on the business, because again, that's being so uncertain as only just being used. 
So just ensuring that the level of uncertainty and volatility that that has, or could bring 
is built conservatively into our plans and that we can balance out any of those headwinds. Uh, you know, 
I think it's been interesting that there's been a lot of discussion around the home category, experiencing these great tile wins 
from, uh, you know, the COVID moment, all of a sudden retail and baiting facing incredible headwinds 
and confusion and, and consent from the customer that we've had to buy. So 
I feel really positive that we're delivering positive comps, profit EBITDA in the face of that uncertainty and want to ensure that we've got a balanced plan going into 2021. 
Got it. So, uh, understood. Um, and then in terms of the fourth quarter, I mean, just relative to history for gross margin rate to be, 
you know, worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, just trying to really understand that 
you mentioned not being, you know, more promotional in December, 
um, is it, uh, you know, you get about our math about 140 bibs from the accounting shift between cost of goods and SGNA. 
So is the shipping surcharges are gonna be charged, can be much larger than the 80 basis points, 
uh, that you saw on 3Q, you lap at 180 basis points of markdown pressure. And obviously, you know, it seems like a very inventory. 
So just trying to understand that dynamic on a, 
you know, sort of a year, a year and sequential basis in gross margin, such that it would be flattened in the fourth quarter, year 
over year. Sure. Chris, um, it's right on what you said about the shipping costs. 
Uh, part of the reason in the prepared remarks, we talked about 80 basis points impact in Q3. 
That was just the latter part of the quarter. 
What we're asking maybe in Q4 is over 150 basis points impact, 
and we're committed to offsetting that again through discipline promotion management and mix, and that's what we will do. 
But the incidents on the shipping costs it's much larger in Q4. And that's why we're being 
prudent on that. <crosstalk>. Go ahead. Sorry. 'Cause I'll just also add if you're looking at Q4 versus Q4 last year, 
uh, the thing you've just got recognized in that as a consumer behavior and the impact of digital purchasing versus store purchasing. 
You know, it is not like the like, and it's definitely accelerated, 
uh, and that's brought with it, um, natural pressures to margin a mix as we've shared that we're offsetting that and mitigating that to be stable, I think is a real achievement. 
So these are, you know, it's, it is a Q4 like now are there and the consumer behavior that digital pivots, and therefore what that's meant for margin inclusive shipping 
is part of what we're balancing 
on. And again, one month into our, our three month quarter, but, uh, we want to make sure that we're being prudent. 
Understood. Thanks so much guys. And our next question is from Peter Benedict, from Baird. 
Hey guys. Thanks, uh, thanks for taking the question. Um, first I'm just curious on, um, on the adoption of BOPUS and I know it's been around six months and, and you know, the curbside. 
But I mean, how is that trending relative to expectations and, and what, um, kind of, what are your plans or goals to drive continued adoption of that, 
um, in the, in the months ahead? That's my first question. 
Yeah, Peter, great question. I, I think what we've seen, you know, we showed an overall statistics for, uh, 
Q3, but I'm packing that you see an escalation and a movement into the new muscle remembering we only introduced this in May. 
Uh, so what we're seeing now is we have an NPS score of 80, 
you know, we're able to provide about a two hour assurance on our order fulfillment store level on that. It's actually in real terms, around 30 minutes, customers are loving it. 
I think in a total industry level, both us as a muscle on it. And a new methodology is very accepted by the customer. And we're benefiting from that as well. 
We saw out right, uh, in the December period escalate week in week out, 
uh, as customers became more concerned around delivery shipping times, 
and really ensuring that I had a joyous holiday period that I could secure the President under the tree. And so we really went into, 
um, creating, uh, ease and convenience for our customer that they really responded to and we're very grateful for. 
We believe these are constants now and they muscles in the business that we want to maintain. 
And for us, we know that a BOPUS order fulfilled by store is almost equivalent to a store by <inaudible> profitability. 
So the differential helps us and has helped us through Q3 and will help us in Q4 in terms of, uh, shipping and profitability costs. 
Uh, so we think it's here to stay. It is one of the sticky outcomes, all not just the, the progression in BOPUS, but how COVID has fortified this is a new muscle for most retailers. Okay. Thanks. 
Thanks for that, Mark. And then, I guess, shifting you guys brought registry a couple of times, uh, during your prepared remarks, and 
I'm not sure how much you're willing to share quantitatively on, on the size of those businesses, but maybe it doesn't quote more qualitative comments, 
um, baby versus wedding. Um, and, uh, I mean, you talked a little bit about basket size, but just curious, kind of how you, how you see those two businesses 
or that business across the two segments, um, uh, as part of your outlook over the next couple of years on the opportunities. Thanks. 
Yeah, I, it's a, it's a great point. I would actually differentiate between a moment in time experience versus the cardboard experience. And the moment in time experience 
as John outline a baby registry is very strong product, 
but it has been more reliant on an in-store experience. And when we do that, we build a bigger basket 
it's more sticky and higher customer engagement. And so we've been pivoting to strengthen our digital registry. 
Uh, and we'll invest there further, but for us, we see complete upside in 2021, 
uh, with, you know, the return to a more normalized shopping environment in stores and digital into the true Omni. 
When we turned to Bed Bath and Beyond the story's even better, we are consistently in the top of the ranking in, and have held market share in most recent data 
in terms of registries. 
Uh, now we haven't had the benefit of that in our 2020 or current numbers because of the COVID moment. And people are just not having wedding ceremonies. 
In 2021, there's going to be pick up demand and transfer into, into that year, uh, for weddings to occur. 
And because we are number one in those spaces and well-placed with held market share and that the stats are good. 
We feel like that as a runway for growth, 
uh, over the next couple of years is one of our solid strengths that hasn't existed in our 2020, or current numbers. And we're going to be doubling down and investing there even further. 
The next question is from Steven Forbes, from Guggenheim. 
Good morning. So I wanted to focus on the trends within the categories, maybe outside of the top five that you noted in the release. 
Um, so, so Mark, just curious how, how these categories are performing. Um, I know it's early, but performing and within some of the new concept stores or remodels, 
and, and, or if you could just speak to some of the initiatives, right. That set around the dressing, the performance here, 
right. 'Cause although it's the lower percentage of sales is still one third here. So I'd love to see how you're thinking about improving, um, in those specific, uh, 
categories and- Yeah. uh, in the structure that's within them. 
Yeah. Thanks Steven. It's a great question. I think that there's been some natural, 
uh, headwinds there just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to soul-based traffic, the digital traffic for us, 
and one of them is personal care. 
Again, um, we, in our remodel stores, uh, that we've been testing 
our personal care business is booming and actually showing a huge differential to our control. And when we get the traffic, we get the trade. 
Um, and I think what we saw in, in the end of Q3, uh, and, and somewhat in Q4 is this sort of suppression of foot traffic in stores that has a direct correlation. 
And that's a business that either, um, is a great basket build business, or is just part of a trip to store that's just not occurring at this moment as frequently it has in the past. 
I think of a couple of key areas to where, uh, we have had some, uh, some softness, um, I, 
I think cleaning is a really good example for us. An area that's normally been strong. I think, uh, getting supply product has been an issue. 
Um, it's, it's constrained across the globe, uh, and, and we just haven't been, uh, firing in that space. 
Um, but at the same time, we also cleared out of smaller categories like food, um, to kind of clean up our assortment that we build into that impact. 
So we're really focused on doubling down as strengths categories. 
You see that coming through and consis- consistent through Q3, uh, Q4 and our efforts and strategically in 2021. 
But we are definitely focusing on a couple of key categories where we can really ramp up our inventory and our focus. 
And we're already starting to see positive sides of that in January. 
Thanks. We're gonna, its just a quick follow-up uh, for you Gustavo, 
yeah, obviously we know the minimum wage rate increases that are transpiring this year and, 
um, yeah, potential some pressure, right. From other retailers announcing, you know, the path to 15. 
So curious how you guys think about, um, you know, that as a pressure point right on the business, 
uh, and, and what's incorporated right in the financial guidance, uh, as it relates to wage investments for 2021. 
We definitely see the emerging trends and the, and the evolution, uh, we're looking at, you know, change of leadership and how that can impact on that no news on that today, 
other than the way of looking at it very, very 
carefully, uh, want to be competitive in the marketplace and we'll be absorbing that into our roll up cost and, uh, financial plans going forward. 
Thank you. Best of luck. Our next question is from Carla Casella, from JP Morgan. 
Hi, um, cou; d you just give us an update on what, how much of your cost savings did you achieve in the quarter from your overall goal? 
Yeah, we're on track with the path that, uh, the objective we have of 200 to $215 million going 
next year, we expect about 125. 
Uh, at least in the current quarter we saw, um, savings as you saw in the building blocks, right? 
180 basis points from product margin, 
um, and savings, including leverage a distribution costs of 210 basis points. 
Okay. So we could kind of go towards the cost savings program. Okay. That's great. 
And also, 
um, um, did you provide overall, um, same-store sales at buybuy BABY or Harmon? I know you gave some details, but I don't think I heard the same source sales number overall? 
Well, we did not provide that <inaudible>. 
I mean, historically for the third quarter? 
No, we haven't <crosstalk>. No, we said in the prepared remarks is, 
um, in the third quarter, same store sales were down in buybuy BABY and then recovered in December. 
The reason where they were down temporarily in the quarter is some of the dynamics that John spoke about. 
Just keeping mind store sales, store traffic, particularly in buybuy BABY slowed down significantly in November. 
And it was partly compensated by the strengthened digital, um, but still that recovery started happening in December. 
Okay, great. And if you're, how much of your, if you look at the Bed Bath and Beyond business alone, how much of that business was done by digital? 
I know you talked about digital growth there, 
but I'm wondering you gave it for the overall company, but how has that <inaudible> in Bed Bath and Beyond versus last year? 
What did share that, that digital growth there is 94% for the quarter Carla, so exceptionally strong. 
I guess I was wondering with what percentage is the digital sales, not the growth? 
<crosstalk> of the overall company. Okay. Third <inaudible>. Think about <inaudible>. Yeah. 
I think that the reference point to that Carla is, is that we're <inaudible> And so, and that was a growth and growth at the prior year at six 
to 8%. So you can see that exponential growth of remembering that only includes the November portion, uh, of, uh, holiday periods. So… 
And our next question is from Mike Lasser, from UP- UBS. 
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Mark, you mentioned several times about the importance of driving in-store traffic to the Bed Bath model, whether it's through the wedding registry or some of the personal care products 
in one of the long lasting outcomes that this situation is that they're just going to be a higher penetration of e-commerce in retail. 
And some of the initiatives that you're rolling out, like I pick up and ship to, 
uh, ship to home are going to drive less traffic to your stores. 
So how are you going to balance that over the long run and generate some of your sales productivity initiative? 
Well, we <crosstalk> Thanks for your question. 
Now, we saw, uh, when things started to normalize in the middle of the year before the second wave came through, we saw really great competent stores and the Omni-channel benefit of stores and digital really came together 
in a positive way. 
Um, you know, for us in our food planning that we provided for the three-year plan, we've actually shown, 
um, we've actually factor in a very high digital right into that, so that our financials remain stable. 
But we see that the driving to store phase really does come from an Omni-channel environment. I think there's a number of great retailers exemplifying this with alignment. 
And a trip to the store, whether it be for BOPUS or for a true trip, 
both generate a sense of the store in your community as part of your network and part of your needs lifestyle. 
So we look forward to a more normalized base. 
We think our stores will be ready when that come through with new visual merchandising, your assortment, your planning, and in 150 doors plus are a completely new environment. 
And what we've seen in those new environments is that when we provide that, um, the differential to our control is very, very strong 
and that we see sales growth. But we are a firm believer in stores, we're investing in stores. 
Uh, and then we think that our assortment, our presentation and our remodels will really help us even further there. Okay. 
My follow up question is in the bridge that you provided for your gross margin for 20- 
2019 to 2021, you talk about the positive drivers 
is sourcing own brands, better promotions and markdowns and coupons upset by some channel shift and freight costs. 
In that there's, there's no real discussion around reinvestment in, in pride or other traffic driving initiatives. 
And this is going to be at a time where arguably, I mean, uh, debatable that some of the tailwinds at the home-related category are going to fade 
in a reopening environment. Yeah. 
I think the reason why that's not in there is that work has been done. 
I mean, we're already showing that the indices on the <inaudible> for our key categories, that we're showing great everyday parody to our key comp set. 
Uh, we've, have promotions that we using now are taking hold, 
and actually we've using them more effectively. So we're seeing cost savings in the promotion. They're getting much more effectiveness. 
We've believed that these muscles, which we've displayed in the last two quarters that have really driven great gross margin growth, are sustainable, or inside the mix. 
Uh, Mike, I think that the, the promotional expectation of 2021, I feel as I've 
stated, I think we see great data that shows that the home trend will be sticky. 
This is a part of people's lives now, and their expectation of creating joy and comfort at home. 
Um, and, and we don't believe that there's going to be, uh, an exceptional chase into a promotional activity, 
but our financials and our promotional cadence that we have, and the balance we've created this year is ready for that in 2021. 
And our last question is from Seth Basham, from Wedbush Securities. 
<inaudible> and good morning. Um, my first question is just on your EBITDA guidance for 2021. 
Could you give us some color as to what the impact from the banner 
sales is, uh, specifically cost plus and, and, uh, uh, Christmas tree shops in that forecast? 
So, the guidance we're providing a 2021 is already on our core banner basis. 
It is, it only includes Bed Bath, buybuy BABY, bed rest and Harmon. 
We showed in the bridge, what would be the proforma, uh, 
2019 posed those banners of <inaudible>. And that's the starting point of $425 million. Okay. 
That's <crosstalk>. Even 
ongoing basis. Yes. That's one of the things that we weren't able to do at the investor day. And we share with many of you after was that, 
uh, we had to include in full our cost plus world mind that 
business, um, in terms of the EBITDA projection, but we didn't include in the <inaudible> projection. 
So what you see now with that sale is that from a range of being presented, um, based on the true pro- proforma of 2019. 
Again, still with that responsible attitude to EBITDA for the full year, based on some of the early changes in half 
on the communica, but, you know, it was a secondary pivot that we can provide to be even more definitive on the wider, further growth. <crosstalk> 
And I know this, but it's a tighter range on revenue. 
Now, when you compare net sales 2021, 
there's a report of sales in 2020 to 2019. It's not comparable. That's why we want to provide the guidance on a comparable basis. 
And we're going to see some of that dynamic in Q4 already. While we've mentioned that Q4 net sales are going to be down double digits. My reporting basis 
between 15 up to 20%, just simply the impact of the ban on divestitures. 
It's a significant information going on. 
This is a totally different shape of the P&L uh, next year on concepts, on sales, on stores. 
Understood. My follow up questions related to the mix of online versus in store sales that you're expecting in 2021. 
When you expect that mix of in-store sale to increase from 2020. And if so, why 
do you expect so much channel 
shift headwind? Is it just because of freight rate increases? 
Yeah, I mean, we do. I mean, there's a natural pivot back to stores that there just will be uh, you know, and again, it's been such an exceptional year. 
Uh, we think that the digital penetration will, um, continue to be strong. 
Uh, and we've got great offsets to that, you know, including where we were sharing that 36% of all the digital loaners were actually fulfilled by, 
uh, stores in the quarter was just incredible agility there. 
So we're going to be offsetting some of the costs we see some freight permeating in 2021, uh, but we are factoring in the high digital penetration ring. 
Thank you very much. 
And that's all the time we have for questions, I will now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. 
Thank you. And thank you all for participating in our call today. 
Please feel free to contact me or Felix with any additional questions. 
Have a great day and stay safe. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.
