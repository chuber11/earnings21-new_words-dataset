And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris Ahern. Chris? Thanks, Brendan, and thank you to everyone on today's call. We hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. 
Firstly, let me start by thanking our entire ZAGG team across the globe. I'm extremely proud to see how our teams reacted through the quarter, 
and never lost sight of serving our consumers and partners with quality product that protect and enhance our devices. 
Over the course of the third quarter, it was pleasing to see our results improve significantly compared to the second quarter, and exceed our expectations. 
We are encouraged by our recent performance, given the challenges we continue to face from the ongoing health pandemic and its impact on the economy. 
Our work over the past several months, which has included reducing expenses, 
adapting our operations to the current retail environment, 
and aggressively managing inventories, has put the company in a much stronger financial position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season. 
Looking at our third quarter in more detail, as we discussed on our Q2 call in August, we saw a significant sequential uptake in sell-through in June for both our protection and power up 
categories, as several of our larger customers reopened their doors and resumed more normalized store operations, 
with some sell-through weeks even exceeding last year's levels. 
This trend continued into July and consistently improved throughout August and September. 
While our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced early in the pandemic 
when most of the brick and mortar was closed, it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us. 
With respect to our overall performance, Q3 revenue coming at $115 million compared to 137 million in the year-ago period, a decrease of 21%. 
This represents a nice improvement from the 28% year-over-year decrease in revenue we reported in the second quarter. 
Despite the roughly 32 million drop in revenue compared with the third quarter last year, combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses, 
we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $15 million, 
thanks to cost-saving measures we enacted early in the pandemic. 
Taylor will go through in greater detail in the balance sheet, but I wanted to g- share a few highlights. 
Despite significant market pressure from COVID-19, our account receivable DSOs improved compared to last year, inventory dec- decline compared to where we ended Q2, 
we generated positive operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarter in net debt balance on a year-over-year and sequential basis. 
By taking quick, decisive action back in April and more recently, working closely with our retail partners on their store reopening efforts, 
we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions, 
ensuring the financial viability of the company and positioned ourselves to exit this difficult period as a stronger, more nimble organization. 
I'll now provide some additional color to our categories, 
starting with protection. We continue to build on our overall digital wellness strategy. For a few years now, our hero screen protector has been VisionGuard, 
a product that reduced exposure to high-energy visible blue light 
that can have damaging effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution. 
We have now sold over 10 million units with this technology. 
In additional, all InvisibleShield screen protectors produced this year and beyond, now also include antimicrobial technology. 
This includes our entire line up for the new iPhone 12 which is now available in stores. 
Earlier this year, we introduced our newest product geared towards our digital awareness strategy, 
a UV- UV phone sanitizer which works with all mobile devices and kills up to 99.9% of staph and E. coli surface bacteria. 
Our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retails and our consumers, and has led to increasing sell-through and greater shelf fa- space with many of our accounts. 
We've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection to protect cases with good success, 
starting with the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch earlier this year, and right through to the recent iPhone 12 launch. 
All Gear4 protective cases now also feature antimicrobial technology. 
The combination of this enhancement benefiting Gear4's differentiated D30 impact technology 
is driving excitement amongst, uh, consumers, especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution. 
With the new iPhone 12, Gear4 is now available and growing across all of our carrier partners. 
This expanded distribution accelerated the momentum in Gear4 brand, and I'm exciting to see it continue to grow through 2021. 
In our power category, mophie launched many exciting new products during Q3, including the introduction of a new line of wireless charging solutions. 
These innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location. 
In addition, last month we launched a new mophie Juice Pack Connect. 
This new product represents an evolution of our popular Juice Pack, 
allowing users to easily charge their phone on demand using a detachable battery featured as not device specific, and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case. 
Our HALO brand continues to perform well on QVC, which has been a productive partnership and channel, particularly give the number of consumers spending more time at home. 
Q4 is a busy time for our brands with QVC and <unk>, with a number of airings planned during the holiday period. 
Looking ahead, with the majority or our US partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue to improve, 
combined with solid director consumer trends, we feel optimistic about our <inaudible> for the remainder of the year. 
While there's still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior this holiday season, including the effect on several countries in Europe that have recently implemented lockdowns, 
we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless of which channel our consumer chooses to engage with the brands. 
We are currently planning fourth quarter revenue to increase on third quarter levels and continue improving on the year-over-year declines we've experienced the past two quarters, 
even as we're facing tough comparison to last year's record Q4 sales. 
I am confident in the longterm course we have set for the company, our reference around antimicrobial UV sanitization and blue light protection 
are driven by our belief that consumers will increasingly look for solutions that will enhance their digital awareness. 
We also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home. We will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs. 
While is remains difficult to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy and our industry, 
I am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. 
This includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin product and categories and simplify our core lines of business. 
As a more nimble company, ZAGG can better service retail partners and core 
consumers, capitalize on the tailwinds from the multiyear rollout 5G with the margin benefits from our brand and <inaudible> consolidation, and generate increased value for our shareholders. 
I will now hand the call over to Taylor. Thanks, Chris. Since many details of our quarterly financial performance are included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today, 
I would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments on our third quarter financial performance. 
Q3 net sales decreased year-over-year by approximately 21% to $115 million. 
After exiting a very difficult second quarter, we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter as retail outlets continued to reopen 
and allow a more normal in-store shopping experience. 
That being said, the residual effects of COVID-19 combined with the delay of the launch of the new Apple devices, 
which push someâ€¦ which pushed some orders into Q4, made it a difficult year-over-year compare. 
Overall, we're pleased with the momentum and sell-through improvements we saw in retail, which enabled us to increase sales by almost 50% on a consecutive quarter basis from $77 million 
to 115 million. 
Q3 gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased year-over-year to 33%. 
There were a number of pits and takes that impacted gross profit during the quarter, including a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds which I'll discuss in more detail in a second. 
This benefit was offset by higher expedited airfreight and increased airfreight rates, um, 
along with the sale of excess inventory of margins that were lower than our historically averages. 
On the subjects of duty refunds, in early August we received an exclusion notice that duties paid on certain products imported from China starting in late 2018 may be subject to refund. 
We worked closely with our customs broker to begin submitting refund documentation to US customs. 
This work is ongoing and given the vo- the volume of imports from China since late 2018, will continue throughout the fourth quarter. 
Based on the work completed to date, we recorded a refund receivable at quarter end of approximately $5.4 million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded. 
The income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized in inventory, 
and then sold in Q3 2020, 
was a net income statement benefit of $1.7 million or approximately 140 basis points to gross profit margin during the quarter. 
As I mentioned, there is still quite a bit of work to do left during the fourth quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions, and I'll provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call. 
Q3 operating expenses decreased 29% or approximately $12 million compared to last year. 
The decrease was due primarily to the various cost cutting measures we implemented as a result of the expected COVID-9- COVID-19 impacts on demand. 
Over the last several months, we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care, 
but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time. 
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus 21 million in the prior year period. 
The decline versus last year is linked to decreased sales and a reduction in overall gross profit margin for the reasons I mentioned. 
These items were offset by the decreases in operating expenses that I just discussed. 
Turning to the balance sheet, compared to a year ago, accounts receivable decreased 33% to $91 million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period. 
However, or DSOs improved significantly from 87 days to 73 days. The quality of our receivables remains very good. 
Inventory was 80 million compared to $94 millions at the end of the first quarter, a reduction of approximately $14 million. 
During the third quarter, we took the conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell-through, customer forecasts, 
and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't overextend on inventory purchasing. 
As a result, we did incur some incremental expedited airfreight charges due to increased demand at the end of the third quarter as retail sell-through improved. 
At this point, we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecast, 
but we'll continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Despite the continued headwinds from COVID-19 during the quarter, we generated third quarter operating cash flow of approximately $9 million 
compared to negative 11 million in cash from operations during the prior year period. 
Net debt which is consolidated debt less cash 
decreased to 81 million compared to 97 million in Q3 last year, and 85 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. 
As we discussed in our last call, during April we amended our credit facility to increase the total amount available under the line of credit from 125 million to $145 million. 
This expansion, combined with the loan received under the CARES Act, 
the Q2 restructuring, and cost cutting initiatives we've undertaken, gives us confidence that we'll successfully navigate the headwinds that COVID-19 has put on the business. 
The capital allocation focus throughout the remainder of 2020 will remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit. 
As we look to the fourth quarter of 2020, we definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in August. However, COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand. 
Given this market uncertainty, we will not be providing annual guidance at this time, 
however given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sell-through trends, we expect strong sequential net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth over the third quarter. 
We expect 2020 year <inaudible> gross margins to pr- to improve during the fourth quarter, 
though as I mentioned, we'll see some pressure over the next qua- next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid- 30s as we sell through our excess inventory. 
We expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high 20s to low $30 million for the fourth quarter. 
No different than from any other companies, COVID-19 has been extremely disruptive to our business, 
however with the steps we've taken to restructure the business, reduce fixed costs and ensure adequate liquidity, 
I'm confident the likes of this period impacted by COVID-19 as a much stronger company than when we entered. 
With that, we will now open up the call, the call for questions. 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press star then the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. Again, that is star then the number one key on your touch-tone telephone. 
Your first question comes from the line of Elliot Alper from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Great, thank you. 
Um, so thanks for the, um, info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter. I guess, 
could you talk about any trends, quarter dates specifically, and specifically, uh, geographic sales mix? Are you seeing any material changes, 
um, with sales in geographies that have less restrictions compared to those that have more? 
Um, yeah, just a, just couple of notes. You know, w- w- with the Apple launch happening, uh, a little bit later than we, um, had experienced previously, 
um, there, there was, you know, maybe $5 million of, of sales that shifted from Q3 into Q4, um, which will obviously benefit kind of the, the sequential, 
um, uh, the sequential look at revenue. 
Um, overall though, we're seeing really good, uh, sell-through of, uh, of the phones. It seems to be doing very successful market and, 
and, uh, obviously we're benefiting thatâ€¦ benefiting from that. So Q4 is starting off, 
uh, really, really well. 
Um, in terms of geos, and, you know, no material change in, uh, geo expansion. You know, Chris mentionedâ€¦ Or, or geo mix. You know, 
Chris mentioned on his, in his prepared remarks that we, we are definitely seeing some headwinds, um, at least in terms of shutdowns in some of our international locations. 
However, um, you know, the wireless dealers in those locations, you know, have been deemed as essential and so those have remained open. 
And so, kind of remains to be seen as to how it's gonna impact, um, 
demand, but, um, I- I think overall, we're, we're definitely seeing some strong signs that, 
uh, that we're kind of getting back to a more normal, uh, you know, Q4 experience, though, though obviously COVID remains, uh, you know, a bit of a, a bit of a cloud over everything. 
Okay, great. And then, um, aside from Apple launch shifting to the fourth quarter, 
um, can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically, and kind of any implications that may have on the December quarter? 
Yeah. The one thing that we, we, we are starting to see is obviously the Black Friday seems to be moreâ€¦ 
Some retailers are taking a strategy with just spreading it all over a number of days, 
over a, over the month. So that's something that's gonna be different. 
I think we're still gonna see a pretty strong online, um, attachment from both <inaudible> .com and obviously through Amazon. 
So, but we're, we're very, um, I would say, optimistic about the sell-through, the early sell-through on all screen protection and cases, uh, are quite strong. 
And that's given that we still have a number of other devices to take to market actually this week. 
So overall, I think we have, uh, some good runway for the, the holiday season <inaudible>. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, thanks Elliot. 
And once again, in order to ask a question, please press start then the number one on your touch-tone telephone. 
So your next question comes from the line of Matt B. from Titan Capital Management. Your line is open. Great, thank you. 
I was hoping you could put a number on the, uh, expediting shipping cost that you, uh, that 
you, uh, incurred in the third quarter, just to, uh, to give us some, uh, better idea how m- how significant those were. 
Yeah, it was- <crosstalk>â€¦ you know, between two and $3 million, and, you know, as I mentioned, um, in, in my prepared remarks, 
you know, we, we, we reallyâ€¦ It w- It was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we were trying to run it down and, you know, and just sell-through picked up at the end. 
Um, you know, we did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some, some expedited airfreight charges. 
Same for the fourth quarter, are you expecting that to, uh, to reoccur, or is it, uhâ€¦ Have you caught up and you feel like you're in a better place 
now? Yeah, it's a, it's a great question. Um, you know, I, 
I think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand. 
Um, you know, the, the one thing that's also kind of impacted us, uh, no different than any other company that's importing from overseas, is just generally, freight rates have increased kind of globally. 
And so that's, that's also impacted it. But I- I- 
I think there's probably gonna be a little bit of that, you know, s- a- as I mentioned, it's a bit of a balancing act. We, we definitely wanted to, uh, be careful, 
um, you know, given the pandemic and, and how much inventory we were planning. And, you know, fortunately or unfortunately, we've seen some, some upsides which is great, 
but we've had to chase those. And so I think we're probably still chasing a little bit which w- will impact some of our, uh, Q4, um, Q4 sales and, and, and then also obviously the spend on freight. Great. 
Also wanted to ask, you know, if I could really quickly, about the tariff situation. And now with the, uh, Biden predi- 
presidency, I know you've been moving, uh, some production out of China. 
Does that change your, your view on, on moving production out of China, 
or how are you thinking about this, uh, this new, uh, regime? Yeah. 
I think, uh, Matt, it doesn't our strategy. Uh, ultimately we're looking to diversify across our CM base and, and make sure that we're setting the company up for, 
um, continued business. 
So we- we're still following the strategy and, you know, we've had a very good quarter where we've now successfully have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of China. 
So it gives us that ability to be able to shift our, 
our supply chain when needed. 
Um, o- obviously, China is still a big part of our, our strategy, but 
what I like is w- we're not just looking at it from a tariff perspective now. We're really looking at it from a business continuity perspective. Great. 
Thank you both. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. Thank you. Once again, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your touch-tone telephone. 
Gentlemen, I'm sure there are no further question at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Chris Ahern for any closing remarks. 
Thank you. I thank everybody for joining our Q3 earnings report. We look forward to updating you again on Q4. 
Uh, have a great evening everyone, and stay safe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.
