Adam Samuelson, uh, we'd like to know, 
What do you anticipate would be the Chinese DAP exports in the second half of 2020? 
Um, they have huge build outs target, and even better remuneration framework with a double sided-20 year inflation-linked CFD. 
Upon the closing of the refinancing, maximum availabil- availability under the ABL facility was expanded by 75 million to 275 million. 
Excluding this adjustment, our run rate utility O&M was up $2.90 million or 2.60% due to higher operations and employee costs. 
The remaining O&M expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and a cost of Spire STL pipeline, which is now in operations. 
I think we're acknowledging that we're gonna see shop visits and CSA billings, uh, take on some real pressure due to the downturn. 
We are, we are, we are way down, that has a direct feed into shop visits, CSA billings and the like. 
guys. Yeah. So I can start on the, uh, on the OPEX trajectory and maybe expanding on this solution to some extent, 
Um, but, uh, to- to answer your question around the OPEX investments, Patrick, yes. 
uh, you know, uh, DNA to support the business. There are a number of factors that drive that OPEX in the first, um, you know, in the, in the first few years. 
And then finally, uh, the mobile IOT piece <inaudible> the consumer, the mobile IOT piece of it is always a natural place for SiTimes growth, 
especially as we res- resumed operations at the end of the third quarter, following an extended government mandated shutdown in China, associated with the Coronavirus outbreak. 
Looking ahead, while the business environment remain, remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the Coronavirus in China, we 
Importantly, our expectations for the fourth quarter assumed the Coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations, 
However, the potential impact with the Coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point, given the solidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain its spread. 
While our consumable sales show a steeper decline than our T&E sales, both segments actually performed roughly similar from an end customer perspective. 
Due to the nature of the products, T&E has a longer order lead time and therefore, deliveries continued over an extended period, 
The second factor impacted consumables more than T&E, is the fluctuations in inventory levels in the dealer network. 
Rest of the world consumables declined more than T&E sales in the senc- in the second quarter. 
Objectives one and two, allow for near term growth, without a significant AcelRx commercial investment. 
As this is the second part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with a minimal AcelRx investment. 
Successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the second pillar and support the DSUVIA sales growth with minimal AcelRx investment. 
Thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today, and for your continued support of AcelRx.

uh, uh, advertisers for, uh, for the premiere, premiere week of WGN, uh, America's NewsNation. 
uh, the NewsNation, uh, primetime, uh, 
Spartan is now integrated into the FNE segment operationally, and we do not plan to call out it's individual contribution in the future. 
Total FNE backlog was 966 million up 16% year over year. 
which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion to earnings within the FNE segment. 
We currently expect year over year FNE revenue improvement versus this year softness related to COVID absenteeism and inspection delays, which occurred primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters. 
Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure. 
and Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, 
Speaking of Cytiva, I wanna take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. 
With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than five billion dollars, which represents approximately 50% of our life science platform's annual revenue. 
but I tell you Cytiva is off to a great start. As I mentioned, a 10%, 10% core growth in the first quarter, 
but, um, you know, in terms of w- where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. 
supported by our exposure to retail and the continued recovering food service and QSR demand in particular. 
coming from the food service and QSR segments as the segments adapt to the situation in each country. 
level, this channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segments. 
we've been shifting, shifting our operations, also with the growth of QSR, 
while the QSR is around 9%. 
Uh, of course, that QSR requires, um, some DSI, which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment. 
We believe hybrid is meaningful. We believe that it's- it's a differentiator for SureSmile. So we- we're actually keeping those components. 
And then, you know, what we're seeing is we're- we're getting real traction on SureSmile tends to be, 
So when we can add something that's integrated and seamless like SureSmile into- into the package, and particularly, 
and then oh by the way, maybe next week somebody will come in with SureSmile. No. It's- it's really… W- r- we've begun to focus much more 
Yeah. Um, look, we- w- we're happy to take SureSmile into the orthodontist office and- and the GP office. 
We're seeing more success there so look, we will continue to pitch, uh, SureSmile across both the orthodontics- orthodontic as well as the GP channel. 
uh, what we've seen, uh, over the last year is accelerating growth behind SureSmile. 
Additionally, in terms of unique users, Nexstar's digital properties ranked number one in the country in local news, number 12 in all of news and information, 
As the nation's largest producer of local news programming, Nexstar's proprietary content provides essential news and information to users and viewers 
With Nexstar's market-leading stations and sites, deep, local, and national reach, 
Notwithstanding marketplace challenges, Nexstar's local sales initiatives continue to generate healthy levels of new business, 
of Nexstar's 5,400 journalists and 110 local newsrooms across the country. 
And we continue to expect Nexstar's net leverage to decline to approximately four times by year end. 
Nexstar's leading local platforms are well-positioned to continue building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet. 
In summary, I hope that our comments today reinforced the fact that we remain confident in the strength and the resilience of Nexstar's scale and diversified business model. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Nexstar's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment through the several factors, including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs, 
Um, let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly, Amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems. 
Amex has historically, um, kept their spending levels and sup, and supportive consumers at a higher level through crisis and I think that's because of the returns Amex has via the network. 
so, uh, wanted to ask about lending, lending… Amex is getting more creative. 
Um, so maybe you can discuss how Amex is expanding its lending if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet, which I believe historically was about half that of the spend share? Yes. 
Amex has done, um, since Steve took over, Amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles, 
point is, how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed? And how's Amex thinking about that? 
Amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up. 
Well, last year we didn't have BOPUS curbside pickup or same-day delivery in our offering. 
In turn, this will allow us to meet the increased demand for BOPUS curbside and same-day delivery services. 
As young parents take safety into consideration this year, our new Omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are with BOPUS 
with BOPUS orders representing approximately half of all store fulfilled orders. 
Since introducing BOPUS and contact lists curbside pickup services earlier this year, we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers. 
In the third quarter, approximately 1.2 million customers placed a BOPUS order representing 16% of our total digital revenue. 
In the Bed Bath and Beyond banner, BOPUS orders represented 15% of total digital sales and 17% of total digital orders. 
And 60% of our BOPUS orders are, were ready within 30 minutes surpassing our two-hour promise. 
This fast and convenient experience has earned Bed Bath and Beyond a net promoter score of 80% for our BOPUS services. 
Importantly, the DTC side of the Canadian business, including both e-commerce and corporate sales also registered exponential growth during the period. 
keep consumers engaged while, uh, while we get our in-stocks back at the level, both in wholesale and our own DTC channels in the way we want it. 
DTC momentum, even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced even stronger sell-through during the quarter. 
Within DTC, the YETI.com business continued to lead the way, 
Overall, DTC reached 51% of net sales for the period compared to 41% in last year's period. 
driven by the significant shift in channel mix towards a faster growing DTC channel primarily with higher outbound freight. 
and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our DTC. So we're constantly looking at satisfying consumer demand, 
YETI.com definitely led the way. So if I think about, um, the DTC business, YETI.com 
um, in the second quarter and the third quarter, but even if we go back to the, to the first quarter and, and the whole algorithm of the company of DTC growing faster than wholesale. 
it did this year because of the significant outperformance of DTC. And then, and 
is my DTC becomes a bigger, um, percent of the business every incremental 1% mix gives me less on the mix, 
We're gonna see expanding gross margins. Now we're rolling over as fourth quarter always is, our biggest DTC quarter every year. 
We reduced our 2020 CapEx target to approximately €175 million, a €96 million 
Through the first half of 2020, we've spent €32 million less in CapEx than in the same period of last year. 
Lastly, we also spent about 600 million in gross CapEx. We're on track now to reduce 25% of our CapEx spend this year. 
So, number one is, number one is inventory. The second one is CapEx investments, and the CapEx investments fall 
it looked this was one of those periods where there was a pretty big delta between, I guess I'd say cash CapEx and, you know, 
uh, sort of CapEx incurred in the quarter. And I was just wondering, um, for the- the free cashflow calculation going forward, 
there is gonna be a bigger delta between- Right. calculating free cashflow the way we do versus if you're using a cash CapEx number. 
Um, and the- the reason for that is because… And of course this is tied to the cash CapEx. It's just the time of the payments. 
Ongoing CapEx and transaction CapEx total $40 billion, 
spectrum repack CapEx total 13 million, and received approximately 26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter. 
As a reminder, we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related CapEx over the course of the year. 
SG&A of 249 million was down a substantial 132 million, which is approximately 35% lower as compared to prior year. 
During the quarter, we took decisive action to reduce our SG&A cost, resulting in the steep year over year decline. 
This quarter we accrued $50 million in SG&A for this initiative. 
Our SG&A in the third quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses, but increased support for expanding the Just BARE brand nationally, 
Also included in the reported SG&A is our $50 million contribution to the Hometown Strong initiative and the DOJ agreement. 
Price SG&A rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the third quarter was 12.3% versus 11.1% in the year ago period. 
The higher SG&A rate in 2020 was primarily the result of higher commissions, incentive compensation and professional fees, 
For the 2020 fourth quarter, we estimate our SG&A rate to be between 12.4 and 12.8%. 
The higher projected SG&A rate relative to Q-3 is partially the result of a lower anticipated allocation of G&A expenses to the fee business 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 22% 
Variable SG&A expenses deleveraged 150 basis points 
Non-variable SG&A expenses leveraged 350 basis points driven by the overall strength of the company's top line results. 
Second, we're focused on delivering profitable growth, highlighted by record gross margins and disciplined SG&A management. 
And then if I think about SG&A, um, kind of come down the P&L,
