Adam Samuelson, uh, we'd like to know, 
What do you anticipate would be the Chinese DAP exports in the second half of 2020? 
The year-over-year decreases in operating expenses were a result of lower expenses in both R&D and SGNA, 
Um, yeah, a- as we had last quarter… So we had some movements in PYD, some, you know, some puts and takes, 
Upon the closing of the refinancing, maximum availabil- availability under the ABL facility was expanded by 75 million to 275 million. 
Non- GAAP adjusted EBITA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments ampword mix. 
Moving to non- GAAP adjusted EBITDA, ITNS deliver $135 million in the quarter, which was down 25%. 
Excluding this adjustment, our run rate utility O&M was up $2.90 million or 2.60% due to higher operations and employee costs. 
The remaining O&M expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and a cost of Spire STL pipeline, which is now in operations. 
So, that's why NII is shrinking. 
So, in that sense, the mix of the portfolio is going to change and probably Didier can let you know exactly how do we see NII evolving. 
Most importantly, the CMT is keenly aware of the impact our decisions have on people, 
I think we're acknowledging that we're gonna see shop visits and CSA billings, uh, take on some real pressure due to the downturn. 
We are, we are, we are way down, that has a direct feed into shop visits, CSA billings and the like. 
and we're positioned well for continued FFO per share growth in 21 and beyond. 
On the general administrative side we reduced our absolute cash G&A- G&A expense by about 7% versus the first quarter, which resulted in per unit cash G&A expense of $3.34 per BOE. 
As you know we reduced our cash G&A guidance in May to 15.5 to $16.5 million for the full year, 
As a reminder, our AFRM24 poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action, different from other EGFR signaling 
it will be investigated in the MD Anderson phase one study in CD30 positive recurrent or refractory Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. 
We've been, uh, successful in our collaboration with MD Anderson, moving forward the combination of, uh, 
Uh, as we said, uh, we are ready to start, or MD Anderson is ready to start and we hope to report first patient in and we will provide updates, uh, as we move forward. 
checked so many different options at the moment for NK cells, and we are indeed very convinced about, uh, the activity of the core-blood derived cells from, uh, MD Anderson. Great, 
especially as we res- resumed operations at the end of the third quarter, following an extended government mandated shutdown in China, associated with the Coronavirus outbreak. 
Looking ahead, while the business environment remain, remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the Coronavirus in China, we 
Importantly, our expectations for the fourth quarter assumed the Coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations, 
However, the potential impact with the Coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point, given the solidity and circumstances related to the disease and the actions being taken to contain its spread. 
Objectives one and two, allow for near term growth, without a significant AcelRx commercial investment. 
As this is the second part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with a minimal AcelRx investment. 
Successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the second pillar and support the DSUVIA sales growth with minimal AcelRx investment. 
Thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today, and for your continued support of AcelRx. 
The training of the Zimmer Biomet dental sales representatives is currently being organized. It'll take time to cover the entire sales force, 
Thanks Raffi. So to summarize, we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the DOD, and with the Zimmer Biomet dental partnership. 
So I'm going to have Pam answer those questions. The first one is the Zimmer Biomet opportunity. 
on the diffused and not centralized. Our strategy to partner with others to penetrate those markets exactly as we did with Zimmer Biomet. 
By category, Drinkware returned to strong growth during the quarter with net sales increasing 31% 
We are very pleased with the continued strength of our original Drinkware SKUs, even as we introduce new products to address additional use cases for our customers. 
Additionally preparations for the September 1 launch of WGN America as primetime national news cast, NewsNation, which will reach approximately 75 million households across the country, 
through NewsNation soon to be launched app, NewsNation Now, which will create another opportunity for monetization 
uh, uh, advertisers for, uh, for the premiere, premiere week of WGN, uh, America's NewsNation. 
uh, the NewsNation, uh, primetime, uh, 
Our total NPL ratio showed a slight 28 basis points year over year increase to 2.5% mainly due to the SME segment 
It will be at that time when NPL ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic. 
an analysis regarding NPL for the entire system. 
how much, uh, NPL ratios, rate for the entire banking system. 
um, and things of that nature. So the, um, expense leverage is really about kind of the top line growth. But other than T&E, 
While our consumable sales show a steeper decline than our T&E sales, both segments actually performed roughly similar from an end customer perspective. 
Due to the nature of the products, T&E has a longer order lead time and therefore, deliveries continued over an extended period, 
The second factor impacted consumables more than T&E, is the fluctuations in inventory levels in the dealer network. 
Rest of the world consumables declined more than T&E sales in the senc- in the second quarter. 
Um, if, if we're looking into next year… and I know you don't give guidance out there… but if we're trying to think about what an OPEX number looks like with kind of a normalized T&E level, 
So, you know, OPEX, especially in three years, there's gonna be, uh, you know… I've backed on dilution, 
guys. Yeah. So I can start on the, uh, on the OPEX trajectory and maybe expanding on this solution to some extent, 
Um, but, uh, to- to answer your question around the OPEX investments, Patrick, yes. 
uh, you know, uh, DNA to support the business. There are a number of factors that drive that OPEX in the first, um, you know, in the, in the first few years. 
Spartan is now integrated into the FNE segment operationally, and we do not plan to call out it's individual contribution in the future. 
Total FNE backlog was 966 million up 16% year over year. 
which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion to earnings within the FNE segment. 
We currently expect year over year FNE revenue improvement versus this year softness related to COVID absenteeism and inspection delays, which occurred primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters. 
Q2 of course, was, was somewhat depressed in our mobile and IOT segment because of the global slowdown and the fact that so many retail stores were closed. 
And you're right in the first half of the year, generally our mobile IOT and consumer business which is, uh, somewhat lower gross margin not that much lower but a little bit lower, 
And then finally, uh, the mobile IOT piece <inaudible> the consumer, the mobile IOT piece of it is always a natural place for SiTimes growth, 
We expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of 2021. 
Also we filed our Sunrise Wind application with BOEM on September first, and expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for the project next year. 
So I wouldn't expect, uh, you know, significant change in the schedule, but uh, at this stage it would be, uh, prudent to wait to see the, the, the, uh, schedule that comes out of BOEM before we, we commit to a final, uh, inservice date. But 
The, um, the, the permitting process, I mean, when, when we meet with, uh, with BOEM, B-O, B-O-E-M, you know, 
EBIT per TEU is well below our normal EBIT per TEU, but this includes also headwind from currency of 6%. 
uh, the 80 to 100, uh, um, Swiss francs, TEU, EBIT per TEU. 
So, will we see a similar tax impact at RWE as it reaches COD on your US projects? Thank you. Um, the tax answer, the question to the text… 
I mean, what's your view in terms of, uh, the, the technologies that are around, and, you know, what you envision that will be the, the role of RWE? 
w, when I compare RWE and your strategy, and you know, what you want it to be with the, with 
The RWE group's adjusted EBITDA stands at 1.8 billion euros. 
Let me remind you that the energy activities which we transferred back to RWE have been recorded in our group figures already, 
Adjusted net income amounted to 795 million euros due to the high adjusted EBITDA of RWE group. 
Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure. 
and Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, 
Speaking of Cytiva, I wanna take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. 
With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than five billion dollars, which represents approximately 50% of our life science platform's annual revenue. 
but I tell you Cytiva is off to a great start. As I mentioned, a 10%, 10% core growth in the first quarter, 
but, um, you know, in terms of w- where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. 
I have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. 
Um, you know, I think the, the, the, the Danaher board was, uh, incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. 
Um, he's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. 
um, but, uh, you know, Rainer we'll, uh, we'll put his own mark on Danaher 
and I am supremely confident that, that mark on Daneber, Danaher is gonna be an outstanding one and an indelible one. 
um, and IDT holding its own as well. So 
um, Cepheid's impact along with IDT, Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line, 
and, and IDT, as well as Radiometer. And even with the, you know, what we think is gonna be a pretty solid performance at, at Cytiva and Pall. 
Eversource parent earned three cents per share in the third quarter of 2020, excluding the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts asset acquisition costs, 
and that is excluded the non-recurring costs related to the purchase of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets. 
uh, while we fully expect the Columbia Gas assets to be <inaudible> to our earnings per share starting immediately, uh, in 2021, 
we have not yet updated our long term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of Columbia Gas, 
From the rate review, reviews <inaudible> six, and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas in Massachusetts 
Um, uh, certainly the addition of Columbia Gas and, um, will be, uh, additive to our existing, uh, forecast. 
supported by our exposure to retail and the continued recovering food service and QSR demand in particular. 
coming from the food service and QSR segments as the segments adapt to the situation in each country. 
level, this channel has proven highly adaptable and continues to improve each month from the low points in April led by the QSR segments. 
we've been shifting, shifting our operations, also with the growth of QSR, 
while the QSR is around 9%. 
Uh, of course, that QSR requires, um, some DSI, which is portioning equipment and some marination equipment. 
The next question comes from <unk> from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Your next question is from Markus Nitton Meyer from UBS. Your line is open. Yeah. 
UBS group. Okay. Getting you into the call now. Alrighty 
Oliveira of UBS. Hi. Uh, good morning, everyone. Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Uh, it's on OXXO, uh, gross margin. You mentioned that, uh, you, your, your numbers are actually very good. 
Now, we go back to a follow-up from Gustavo Oliveira of UBS. Uh, thank you for taking my followup question. You know, if I may, 
NOI growth in future periods should be reliably strong given the multi-tenant leasing metrics this quarter, 
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization or Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Operating Income or NOI. 
which will add $2.1 million to the property's annual NOI. 
We believe hybrid is meaningful. We believe that it's- it's a differentiator for SureSmile. So we- we're actually keeping those components. 
And then, you know, what we're seeing is we're- we're getting real traction on SureSmile tends to be, 
So when we can add something that's integrated and seamless like SureSmile into- into the package, and particularly, 
and then oh by the way, maybe next week somebody will come in with SureSmile. No. It's- it's really… W- r- we've begun to focus much more 
Yeah. Um, look, we- w- we're happy to take SureSmile into the orthodontist office and- and the GP office. 
We're seeing more success there so look, we will continue to pitch, uh, SureSmile across both the orthodontics- orthodontic as well as the GP channel. 
uh, what we've seen, uh, over the last year is accelerating growth behind SureSmile. 
Next question, please. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent <inaudible> from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Understood. Thanks. I'll leave it there. From JP Morgan, we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead. Thanks, Josh. Uh, hey guys. Good morning. Hey Steve. 
And our first question comes from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
And our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. 
Our next question is from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley, please proceed. 
Our next question is from <inaudible> Morgan Stanley. 
And now we'll take a question from Ricardo Alves of Morgan Stanley. 
The next question comes from the line of Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Your next question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
Eh, sure. The next question comes from Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Good morning. C- coming from Goldman Sachs, 
FEMSA basically has a couple of ways that, that we grow. Uh, we either take what we do well to a new geography 
to help, uh, these, these new ventures through, through our FEMSA Ventures arm, 
Um, I mean, the, the, the, the, the amounts involved are, are not huge and relative to the size of FEMSA. But certainly, it's a startup that is doing very well. And of course, uh, 
Um, hello. Um, so, Nei- Neil from Credit Suisse. Hi. Uh, if I can ask first the, uh, uh, another question of Markus, if, uh- Ah! if that works, uh, to give you another opportunity. 
And now, we will take a question from Marcella Recchia of Credit Suisse. 
Your next question comes from John Wells from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sorry. 
Thanks a lot. Good luck. Thank you. Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Um, let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly, Amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems. 
Amex has historically, um, kept their spending levels and sup, and supportive consumers at a higher level through crisis and I think that's because of the returns Amex has via the network. 
so, uh, wanted to ask about lending, lending… Amex is getting more creative. 
Um, so maybe you can discuss how Amex is expanding its lending if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet, which I believe historically was about half that of the spend share? Yes. 
Amex has done, um, since Steve took over, Amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles, 
point is, how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed? And how's Amex thinking about that? 
Amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up. 
For anyone who would like more detail on the various ISRS cases, there's a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today. 
uh, meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the ISRS program. 
And secondly, as reflected here, net economic earnings continues to include all ISRS revenues or saying in another way, excluding the provision we booked for gap purposes. 
For this quarter, ISRS revenue is subject to a provision for $2.20 million, including interest. 
we saw margins and Missouri decline by $3 million as slightly lower residential volume metric margins were offset by higher net ISRS revenues 
ISRS. Uh, the total provision, 
then the commission will not only decide on the, on how to handle each of those individual ISRS determinations, but it will also have, uh, determined whether or not, 
And there's always some difference between what we expect and what we actually get, because our ISRS filings generally include 45 to 60 days worth of forecast 
And so that always gets trued up in a rate case. And, and that is clearly what happened in this, uh, in this filing for ISRS, I'm sorry. Okay. 
We anticipate that continued strength in the fourth quarter will allow for SiTime to set another quarterly revenue record. 
SiTime now offers all three categories of timing products, which are the oscillators, the clocks and the resonators. 
And we believe today that SiTime is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership. 
Moving to 5G, in 5G the opportunities available to SiTime continue to drive the company's expansion into the communications market. 
And the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for SiTime success. 
In conclusion, SiTime is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the first company that continues to provide system level timing solution. 
and they don't have the flexibility that a fabulous company like SiTime which uses semiconductors, uh, can get. 
rollout and, uh, should be a very, very solid place for SiTime. Helpful color, thank you Rajesh. <inaudible>. 
Well, last year we didn't have BOPUS curbside pickup or same-day delivery in our offering. 
In turn, this will allow us to meet the increased demand for BOPUS curbside and same-day delivery services. 
As young parents take safety into consideration this year, our new Omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are with BOPUS 
with BOPUS orders representing approximately half of all store fulfilled orders. 
Since introducing BOPUS and contact lists curbside pickup services earlier this year, we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers. 
In the third quarter, approximately 1.2 million customers placed a BOPUS order representing 16% of our total digital revenue. 
In the Bed Bath and Beyond banner, BOPUS orders represented 15% of total digital sales and 17% of total digital orders. 
And 60% of our BOPUS orders are, were ready within 30 minutes surpassing our two-hour promise. 
This fast and convenient experience has earned Bed Bath and Beyond a net promoter score of 80% for our BOPUS services. 
The government, uh, programs that you allude to, uh, 80, 85% is related to Contract Logistics, but people were out of work. 
So, the business, the operational run rate of Contract Logistics has been extremely strong, although restructuring measures showed the desired effects. 
figures, how strong Contract Logistics will, will Phoenix like come back out of, uh, all the restructuring activities. 
Um, main, uh, main and most important piece to it is, uh, is that because we talk most of it of locations, right, of, uh, of Contract Logistics facilities, right? 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. So, what is the, what is the perspective of that Contract Logistics facility? Is that a facility that is 
Um, the, uh, and the question on Contract Logistics and cost development, the majority of the cost is people, 
Contract Logistics sites are still locked down, and 11 out of them are in one country because some infrastructures have not opened yet. 
and we are almost in full employment again in Contract Logistics. That means we have gross profit related to that activity. 
2019, which is a prerequisite for many of the eTouch, uh, initiatives. Not all of them, but many of those. 
despite the fact that Q2 has been a challenging environment to put through, uh, uh, projects, but we have continued to drive, uh, eTouch initiatives. 
But some of these projects have a slight delay. The message that I want to give you here is, eTouch is on track. 
Conversion rate 11% to 16%. I think everybody's clear. One of the main drivers, eTouch. 
It's not about staff reduction. eTouch is enabling us to do more business. 
And that is eTouch. 
and there's no eTouch yet, 
uh, as a basis for running Sea Logist- uh, uh, eTouch activities in Sea Logistics. 
uh, and the eTouch ability of that business, 
uh, make eTouch happen. 
Consequently, we are working with Textron to ensure our production levels 
are optimistic that the contracts with Textron support provide this option of a technology that not only improves their air performance, but to provide unparalleled safety. 
He will support our present business at Textron and explore new business opportunities in the region. 
We are working with Textron worldwide service organization, supporting all of our retrofits. 
Are we ready to take a breather after a lot of activity on the M&A front? Um, and 
I think we would be interested in taking looks. Uh, but other than that, for the most part, and understanding that M&A is hard to predict, 
I mean, Juan just mentioned the, the M&A potential. 
just improved a lot with the dynamic, and then, you know, M&A would really be the key driver for, for future cash generation. 
And your question related to M&A ambition, I'm a bit surprised, because our, um, proposal, dividend proposal has not changed 
Our M&A ambition, ambition, our M&A strategy has not changed at all. 
Um, M&A is independent of this. 
Uh, so, that is not a criteria that would influence our M&A approach or, uh, delay any M&A. 
and to continue our growth paths that we have embarked on many years ago, uh, we don't need M&A. 
What we, we have defined targets, what we want to achieve with an M&A approach. 
keep consumers engaged while, uh, while we get our in-stocks back at the level, both in wholesale and our own DTC channels in the way we want it. 
DTC momentum, even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced even stronger sell-through during the quarter. 
Within DTC, the YETI.com business continued to lead the way, 
Overall, DTC reached 51% of net sales for the period compared to 41% in last year's period. 
driven by the significant shift in channel mix towards a faster growing DTC channel primarily with higher outbound freight. 
and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our DTC. So we're constantly looking at satisfying consumer demand, 
YETI.com definitely led the way. So if I think about, um, the DTC business, YETI.com 
um, in the second quarter and the third quarter, but even if we go back to the, to the first quarter and, and the whole algorithm of the company of DTC growing faster than wholesale. 
it did this year because of the significant outperformance of DTC. And then, and 
is my DTC becomes a bigger, um, percent of the business every incremental 1% mix gives me less on the mix, 
We're gonna see expanding gross margins. Now we're rolling over as fourth quarter always is, our biggest DTC quarter every year. 
Let me just say again, that we have welcomed our new board members and their enthusiasm and interest in working with the GCP leadership team has been constructive. 
The working relationships have been very engaging and we look forward to jointly continuing to create value for our GCP shareholders. 
and on behalf of my leadership team for all the hard work and efforts they continue to devote to GCP under extremely challenging conditions. 
So it's still in that phase of, uh, getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for GCP going forward. 
GCP sales of 200 million were 23.70% lower than prior year due to the impact of government imposed restrictions on construction activities and manufacturing as a result of COVID-19. 
our June revenues did rebound for GCP overall and specifically in North America, as the economy opened up. 
GCP was close to flat year over year at a 0.10% price decline. 
GCPs lost from continuing operations attributed to GCP shareholders was 1.3 million 
compared to income from <inaudible> the operations attributed to GCP shareholders of 3.1 million per second quarter, 201. 
Now, turning back specifically to GCP, 
The net loss attributable to GCP shareholders in the first six months 
Looking beyond the pandemic, we are confident in long-term fundamentals of GCP and the construction industry. 
It's hard to believe it's been a full year since my first earnings call as CEO of Bed Bath and Beyond. And what an exceptional year of change it has been. 
I'm truly grateful to all our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate that strengths and opportunities as the new Bed Bath and Beyond team. 
And finally, we said our mission is to ensure the Bed Bath and Beyond is well positioned to long-term success. And we're doing just that. 
As part of this work, we are well underway in the process of closing approximately 200 under performing Bed Bath and Beyond stores by the end of fiscal 2021. 
Turning to our Bed Bath and Beyond store remodel program. We have advanced from the initial prototype phase to active iteration within 10 stores in our Houston markets. 
It is, it only includes Bed Bath, buybuy BABY, bed rest and Harmon. 
Our Bed Bath and Beyond banner alone, posted digital com sales up 94%, almost doubling last year sale. 
In the third quarter, 21% of our Bed Bath and Beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about 16% versus last year. 
Our Bed Bath and Beyond mobile app was launched over 15 million times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled versus last year. 
we launched same day delivery on Bed Bath and Beyond.com and buybuy BABY.com to provide our customers another convenient and cost effective way to shop. 
We also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of Bed Bath and Beyond and buybuy BABY stores on shipped and Instacart, 
As we look at our digital program holistically, is a true revolution from where we were a year ago and has become part of the fabric of how we operate at Bed Bath and Beyond. 
Operator, please start the Q&A session. 
Now, before we go to Q&A, I wanna address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
Thanks, Phil, and I'll turn the call back to John just to remind you how to enter questions in the Q&A queue. 
Welcome to the Bed Bath and Beyond fiscal 2020 third qu- quarter earnings call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the Q&A portion of the call. 
The presentation will be followed by a Q&A session. 
And having said so, I would like to hand over back to Sandra to open Q&A. 
This time, if you'd like to ask a question over the phone lines, please press star, then one, on your telephone keypad. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. 
Before turning the call over for Q&A, I want to reinforce three themes that we are seeing in the business. 
Then, we will be happy to answer your questions during the Q&A session. 
We will conclude today's call with a Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. 
Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to update you on our initiatives around diversity and inclusion within our organization 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
is that it's not necessary to make any correction to the value of this investment in Enagas, in Enagas' balance sheet. 
a substantial change for the profile of the company? Is it, is it a game changer for Enagas? Should Enagas change 
And deregulating and government and entities and investors, should they see Enagas with different eyes 
But I can clearly tell you that Enagas is willing to collaborate. 
connected on the side of Enagas but also on Snam's side with the north of Africa. 
First, the investment in our networks. I'm talking about Enagas but you can think about of any other TSO in Europe. 
Spanish. So with those, this conference on the first semester 2020 results of Enagas. Thank you. 
Our European chicken operations, delivered an EBIT in Q3 that was 13% sequentially above Q2 with both volumes and revenue 7% and 18% higher respectively 
Relative to Q3 of 2019, EBIT was still higher 2% despite 8% lower volume and 5% lower revenue. 
references to EBIT, to adjusted EBIT 
and references to margin refer, refer to adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, or adjusted EBIT margin as defined in our press release. 
went down by 9.10% and the EBIT by 18%, down to CHF419 million in the first half of 202. 
we have seen an EBIT of CHF167 million, which were 28% below previous year, as a result of a shifting cargo mec- 
Air Logistics, an EBIT of CHF181 million has been achieved, 
Road Logistics ended the first semester with an EBIT of CHF26 million. 
The unit EBIT is also above, uh, normal, despite higher, uh, currency headwinds. 
While EBIT, 
uh, was, uh, 42% below previous year, we generated a positive EBIT of CHF26 million. 
uh, lower net turn over, and in EBIT, um, almost on the level of previous year, quarter two. 
As a percentage of sales, SG&A improved by approximately 230 basis points 
SG&A of 249 million was down a substantial 132 million, which is approximately 35% lower as compared to prior year. 
During the quarter, we took decisive action to reduce our SG&A cost, resulting in the steep year over year decline. 
Secondly, in 2019, on, your SG&A expense was around CHF445 million. So, 
could you please update on the current run rate on SG&A? 
This quarter we accrued $50 million in SG&A for this initiative. 
Our SG&A in the third quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses, but increased support for expanding the Just BARE brand nationally, 
Also included in the reported SG&A is our $50 million contribution to the Hometown Strong initiative and the DOJ agreement. 
Price SG&A rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the third quarter was 12.3% versus 11.1% in the year ago period. 
The higher SG&A rate in 2020 was primarily the result of higher commissions, incentive compensation and professional fees, 
For the 2020 fourth quarter, we estimate our SG&A rate to be between 12.4 and 12.8%. 
Adjusted SG&A expenses for the third quarter increased by 22% 
Variable SG&A expenses deleveraged 150 basis points 
Non-variable SG&A expenses leveraged 350 basis points driven by the overall strength of the company's top line results. 
Second, we're focused on delivering profitable growth, highlighted by record gross margins and disciplined SG&A management. 
Joc, the largest number of questions seek a better understanding of our countervailing duties, petition. 
Joc, we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets, 
And at that point, if there has been excessive imports, they will look at assessing a retroactive duty. Joc, 
Joc, three analysts submitted multi-part questions related to our potash operations. So first Chris Parkinson's asks, 
Thanks for that clarification, Clint. Joc, I'm now going to move on to questions about Mosaic <inaudible>. 
and high-value products such as our MicroEssentials. Joc, 
Joc, PJ MicroEssentials has a question about currency. 
So both, both commodity and performance products have shown robust increases in Q- Q2 quarter two of 2020 versus a year ago. Joc, 
Joc, can you talk about capital priorities to address both of these questions? Yeah. 
Joc, in a related question, he also asked are normal inventory level for the interest certainly forecast in 202. 
Joc, the last section of questions, really to potash global markets.

The release of the Desert Sunlight track cash, supplements NextEra Energy Partners liquidity, 
The organic growth in investments at NextEra Energy Partners continue to progress well. 
Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners expectations, which remain unchanged. 
With a resumption of cash distributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, we now expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners, 2020 distribution growth objectives, 
Highlighting this significant flexibility, we believe next NextEra Energy Partners has, going forward. 
we will continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners favorable positioning, should give it flexibility to achieve its long term distribution growth objective, 
We are pleased with NextEra Energy Partners year to date performance in 2020, and believe it continues to offer a best in class value proposition for investors. 
The diversity, and long term contracted nature of NextEra Energy Partners clean energy portfolio, 
NextEra Energy Partners has clear visibility into its growth, going forward. 
NextEra Energy Partners long term growth visibility, remains as strong as ever. 
These strengths, together with NextEra Energy Partners favorable tax position, and enhanced governance rights, 
leaves NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives, going forward. 
In closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy, and NextEra Energy Partners, remains as robust as ever. 
um, including recycling of capital through NextEra Energy Partners, um, which is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of Energy Resources projects, 
These transactions, which will make FPL one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio, 
During the quarter, we completed our annual storm drills for FPL, and GUlf Power, to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Now, lets turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. 
For the second quarter of 2020, FPL reported a net income of $749 million, or a $1.52 per share, 
During the quarter we utilized $7 million of reserve amortization, to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $736 million. 
We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 202. 
As we previously discussed, we expect that FPL and Gulf will operate as a single larger Florida utility company, which will create both operational, and financial benefits for our customers. 
Turning towards development efforts, all of our major capital initiatives at FPL remain on track, and on budget. 
Consistent with the toe in the water approach we've previously utilized with solar, and battery storage, we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at FPL. 
FPL benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers. 
Over the second quarter, Gulf Power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage per customer than FPL, 
As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement, to offset fluctuations in revenue, or costs. 
Included in these facilities, is a total of more than $1 billion in 6 month storm facilities, at FPL and Gulf Power, 
the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses, but specific at FPL and. and Gulf Power, 
And, of course, at FPL and Gulf, that's focused on investments that, we need, that we need to create value for our customers. 
Thanks Steve. Yeah. I would say at this point, we're looking fr opportunities across the portfolio. Um, obviously, we talked about the pilot project FPL today, 
um, we do continue to believe, um, that FPL and Gulf would file for a combined rate case in early 20 ' 21, from rates effective in 202. 
um, and we think we have um, a great story to tell, um, and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at, at FPL and Gulf. 
Cash and stock consideration is $8 billion. Since Illumina currently owns 12% of GRAIL's equity on a fully excluded basis, 
As part of the transaction, Illumina will pay GRAIL's shareholders, approximately $4 billion in common stock, which is subject to a collar. 
The number of shares issued be based on penetrate volume, weighted average price of Illumina common stock, 10 days prior to close. 
We believe by joining forces with Illumina, we'll achieve scales faster, preventing more late stage cancer diagnoses. 
And once our deal closes, we'll be able to leverage the global scale and reach of Illumina 
Illumina remains the most innovative company in sequencing 
Having spent time with Francis and the Illumina team, I'm confident we all share the same goal 
Illumina participates in the therapy selection market with our TSO 500 
including a number of national population scale genomics program powered by Illumina sequencing technology. 
As a result, Illumina will play a direct role in accelerating the adoption of genomic medicine, in addition to enabling it. 
As we evolve, Illumina remains committed to all of our customers and partners. 
Illumina has set it up for success by seeding it with technology and some of our best and brightest. 
Our mission at Illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. This hasn't changed in over the last 22 years. 
Now that they stand poised to bring products to market in 2021, we believe this is the right time to bring the GRAIL team into Illumina, 
And the next question was about, you know, clinical synergy. So what are the synergies that, you know, GRAIL will enjoy coming into Illumina? 
All of those things are things that we can do with their part of Illumina and frankly we wouldn't be able to do as well, even if we were a 30%, 40% owner off of GRAIL. 
And so, you know, we anticipated that there'd be work for us to do and explaining this step and explaining the opportunity and explaining why GRAIL and why GRAIL and Illumina. 
Sure. So three questions, I'll take the first one around, uh, GRAIL revenue to Illumina in the last couple of years. 
Uh, could you please elaborate a bit on, on the trend for, for the gross, gross margin for, for OXXO? 
Uh, could you please, uh, help us to understand what could be the impact of those, uh, new labeling rules, uh, in your, in your OXXO business, 
And this mitigated the blow in late April, the least, the last month of the quarter for OXXO. 
And, and that really, I mean, Me- OXXO really lives by the people who are on the go and moving. 
Well, let me tell you. We, we are very optimistic of OXXO in, in, in the medium and long run. Uh, 
I would say also that, that we are better prepared in the returnable bottles that the ones, the returnable soft drinks compared with, with OXXO. 
And I think there is a, uh, a lot of, uh, we see a lot of growth, uh, and, and potential to adjust the value proposition of the Select stores and the OXXO stores in the field. 
No, but I, I, I think if we, we, uh, I ne- but I never, uh, the turnover of inventory in, in, in, in OXXO goes very fast. 
I think on the OXXO front, 
it's a lot easier to go to OXXO than, than to go to the bank, and it's less time-consuming. And 
quarter. Um, and interestingly, I think what, what the OXXO, uh, our OXXO colleagues were observing in recent weeks 
uh, you know, as consumers realize what the assortment and the, the pricing is for, for spirits, uh, at the OXXO stores, 
uh, also obviously realizing the, the potential and the power of, of the OXXO platform, 
uh, we are working hard at, uh, the three-legged stool of, uh, our digital platform at, at OXXO, which involves 
you took kind of OXXO and, and expanded, uh, what it does by a few degrees and, and, you, you know decide to go into, into drugstores. So, 
but that they will use OXXO as a more, 
uh, but also on the, on the standalone OXXO side. So, we, we do aspire to start opening stores, uh, OXXO stores, uh, towards the end of the year. 
Obviously, this is, uh, we've said before, this is not going to be a piece of cake. Uh, you know, figuring out the right val- value proposition for, for the Brazilian OXXO is, is going to take a little bit of time. 
question there, you mentioned that, um, you know, for <inaudible> CapEx, it will be very similar, uh, on the year over year basis. 
I'd like to, to kick on, really, kind of a follow up of what you're talking about with Josh there. As you think about ' 21 CapEx roughly 
how you think about maintenance CAPEX, 
We reduced our 2020 capex target to approximately €175 million, a €96 million 
Through the first half of 2020, we've spent €32 million less in capex than in the same period of last year. 
um, the cross CapEx, the run rates, or the CapEx that we spend into the business 
Um, yes, hello. I have some small technical questions. One is, uh, concerning, the decision concerning CapEx or long-term leases. 
And, uh, so what is the, the, the trigger for a decision going for CapEx or for long-term leases? And how is the 
Lastly, we also spent about 600 million in gross CapEx. We're on track now to reduce 25% of our CapEx spend this year. 
So, number one is, number one is inventory. The second one is CapEx investments, and the CapEx investments fall 
it looked this was one of those periods where there was a pretty big delta between, I guess I'd say cash CAPEX and, you know, 
uh, sort of CAPEX incurred in the quarter. And I was just wondering, um, for the- the free cashflow calculation going forward, 
there is gonna be a bigger delta between- Right. calculating free cashflow the way we do versus if you're using a cash CAPEX number. 
Um, and the- the reason for that is because… And of course this is tied to the cash CAPEX. It's just the time of the payments. 
Ongoing CapEx and transaction CapEx total $40 billion, 
spectrum repack CapEx total 13 million, and received approximately 26 million of reimbursements from the FCC during the quarter. 
As a reminder, we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all spectrum related CapEx over the course of the year. 
We would expect to announce pro forma CapEx for next year shortly after closing. 
So, as a place to start, we're currently thinking we enter 2021 CapEx 
we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet, so we can use some of that should we need to. But y- certainly we'd be also trying to balance, uh, the, the cash we're making with the CapEx that we're spending and the, and the dividend that, uh, today, uh, uh, satisfies 30% of our return criteria and more, 
So we're seeing a lot of DSUVIA use 
um, in short term settings. Also in, uh, some interesting medically supervised settings, such as fertility clinics, which often have to do, uh, painful procedures and currently use IV opioids in that setting, they're finding DSUVIA to be very nice, non-invasive alternative. 
Um, so again medically supervised settings covers a wide swath of medical specialties and, and we're happy that they've seen the benefits of DSUVIA in each of those different areas. 
Yeah the majority of uh, folks using DSUVIA now are giving it a 
Um, they know these surgeries very well and they know the benefits that DSUVIA can use. 
On today's call, we'll describe the progress we've made toward achieving our strategic objectives, of one, advancing the use of DSUVIA throughout the Department of Defense. 
or 122,000 DSUVIA single dose applicators, 
This approval will be another significant milestone, as it expands access to DSUVIA throughout the other branches of the military. 
several of which have already adopted DSUVIA on formulary, are using it in various treatment settings. 
The <unk> opportunity is one strong pillar that will support DSUVIA sales growth, 
Looking forward we see similar opportunities where customers and large specialty markets outside the hospital and ASC's, can be educated on the benefits of DSUVIA, 
And unlike many hospital products such as anti infective or critical care products, DSUVIA provides a different value proposition, 
as they begin to place orders after they incorporate DSUVIA into their protocols and medical information systems. 
After reviewing data from the initial trial use of DSUVIA, which 
The PMT committee reconvened and approved DSUVIA for formula system wide, including its associated ASC's, 
This is a perfect example of how we see DSUVIA being adopted. 
We continually hear from our physician customers about the benefits they observe in their patients with DSUVIA, 
real world data to illustrate why DSUVIA should be used over some current standards of care. 
As we've said before, the acceptance of DSUVIA on the formula is an eventual adoption into protocols is a process, 
but based on the real world results from healthcare practitioners using DSUVIA, 
who remain confident DSUVIA will become a key treatment for the management of acute pain in medically supervised settings. 
as we're able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of DSUVIA with real world data that will generate long term value for our shareholders. 
As you previously heard the early feedback from the healthcare practitioners dosing DSUVIA is positive. 
We look forward to the publications about the data showcasing DSUVIA and the perioperative setting. 
Um, just in general we said about seven and a half million procedures eligible for DSUVIA but Pam can maybe give examples of what those procedures are. 
So, so answering directly your question is, all of those seven and a half million procedures are addressable DSUVIA procedures. 
That's the estimate of what DSUVIA can be addressing. 
In the second part of that question, Brandon if, if I recall was, where is DSUVIA currently, DSUVIA currently being used? Again I'll defer to Pam as she's been working with various specialists around the country. 
Pam can you also comment uh, briefly on how you're seeing DSUVIA used in the short term settings, in particular for the same day surgeries and the timing of the dose and why? 
grass, in these half yearly results and taking into account that the crisis caused by COVID-19 
Actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to the impacts of COVID-19. 
The net impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions was modest. 
So, now we see a little bit the, the, the, the COVID-19 effects, uh, uh, that had, that pushes down to 62%, again. 
we also have to close a small percentage of our store base due to COVID-19 restrictions and effects. 
To offset the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on commercial advertising revenue, 
As we normally do, we will provide a loan review of our business environment <inaudible> our convictions that <inaudible> Mexico is very well positioned again according to <inaudible> economy impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This includes an increase of $1.8 million in expenses related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $1.5 million increase in employee-related costs. 
certain net increases in expenses and lost revenues due to COVID-19. 
After five months of experience with COVID-19, a hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate PPE 
As we approach the presidential election, we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus and COVID-19 relief for healthcare providers. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the company forward-looking statements, including the current and potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial position. 
<inaudible> in the midst of a fairly complex COVID-19 outbreak, which has periodically been affecting the port and logistics system. 
Despite the challenges the COVID-19 virus presented in the second quarter, our teams around the globe continued to focus on our customers and we are happy to see June rebound as it did. 
and positions as well to successfully manage through the ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Uh, my question is regarding COVID-19. Uh, how is your current level of absenteeism at, at glance? 
And also if you can provide a, some of, of, a kind of our own rate of, of protective measures related to COVID-19 during the quarter and, and what do you see going forward? Thanks. 
that are designed to help mitigate the risks related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
eh, including Covid-19 that could cause actual <inaudible> materially differ, including factors that could be beyond the company control. 
Is that inclusive of what you're seeing with respect to COVID-19 and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you're seeing on COVID-19 
Um, and could we potentially see any increase in tort inflation, you know, as a result of what's going on with- with COVID-19? Yeah, 
Equipment and instruments, digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter, driven by the lower sales resulting from COVID-19. 
Our healthcare business saw a slight decline in Q2 after posting a strong Q1 as healthcare systems were getting ready for their first major waves of COVID-19. 
Latin America remains a challenging market as COVID-19 continues to impact our business in Brazil and other countries in the region. 
um, the implementation of the COVID-19 SOPs, our operating procedures across all operation 
And we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic in the last six months has clearly shown that we have embarked on the right strategy. 
to the one that we made prior to COVID-19. 
despite the impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions. 
about half of which was due to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. 
Reflecting the disruption, asso- associated with COVID-19 in our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. 
reflecting the impact of COVID-19, 
We have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As of last Friday, approximately one-half of 1% of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19, 
We are carefully monitoring COVID-19 hotspots both for the health of our employees, and any potential impacts on supply chain. 
while demand from our customers increased significantly in June, we have experienced uneven demand for our products as a result of supply chain challenges and COVID-19 hotspots. 
And I think what COVID-19 is doing to us, uh, and I guess to many other companies out there is accelerate the number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented. 
our thoughts are with those affected by COVID-19. 
in patients with COVID-19 in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise. 
In combination, trials in COVID-19, psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation. And the results of the trials will characterize the immune-modulating activity of ADX-629 and RASP inhibition 
the virus that causes COVID-19, 
As I shared in my prepared remarks last quarter, there will be COVID-19 related loss activity but there will be some offsetting decline in losses 
Given the continued uncertainty, we've taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of COVID-19 related loss activity. 
That's likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by COVID-19 skews older and is not in the workforce. 
A few court decisions we've seen so far, one in New York and one in Michigan, have both upheld the physical damage requirement in the context of COVID-19. 
Excluding the auto premium refunds we provided to our customers, net written premiums grew by two percent as the impact of COVID-19 on insured exposures was more than offset by strong renewal rate change in all three segments. 
This quarter results include the impact of roughly $5 million, of after tax, COVID-19 related expenses, 
Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
In summary, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions, including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For the quarter, the net impact related to COVID-19 is included in our underlying results, 
The economic impacts related to COVID-19 also affected our underlying losses. 
For example, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $114 million. 
We have not recognized losses or benefits from COVID-19 related insured events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter. 
date basis, the impact on our results, excluding that investment income, from COVID-19 and its related effects is a net charge of about $50 million pre-tax. 
who to this point has not contracted COVID-19 will become ill from COVID-19 as a result of their job duties in December 
the impact on our results from COVID-19 and its related effects is a net charge of about $50 million pre-tax. 
We incurred direct COVID-19 mitigation costs of roughly 27 million for the quarter and close to 77 million year-to-date. 
and Europe also continue to increase despite the challenges due to COVID-19. 
Despite continued challenge in global market conditions due to COVID-19, our consolidated results have also 
Disruptions from COVID-19 have continued to present a significant challenge on each individual country's demand for protein consumption, as well as for the flow of global trades 
and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of COVID-19. 
Um, easing of, uh, COVID-19 restrictions, due to reduction of UK Government incentive directs towards food service, 
From Q2 to Q3, COVID-19 related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environments to protect worker and consumer health. 
High unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food macro environment and the fallout effects of COVID-19 will affect the channels differently. 
and at the same time demand because of the COVID-19, uh, really, uh, create a, a challenging environment. 
um, support from the government with the COVID-19 like we have in US. In Europe, there 
Both those segments are the ones that are most, most affected by the, the COVID-19. 
Impacts due to COVID-19 varied by product line and geography during the quarter, 
which made it difficult to execute in some countries due to COVID-19. 
with the sales declines, all mostly attributable to COVID-19. 
Impacts in Asia, Europe and Latin America due to COVID-19 have been slightly more prolonged and deeper versus North America. 
of 2019 due to challenging construction markets as a result of COVID-19. 
Distributors in April and May did not restock at a normal pace due to the uncertainty of the impacts of COVID-19 on future product demand. 
and larger projects restarting once customer COVID-19 safety procedures were instituted 
decreasing 14% compared with the prior year, mainly due to the second quarter impact of COVID-19 on volumes. 
The change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to COVID-19 in the second quarter, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 
again, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. 
and have learned a lot during the COVID-19 period on how to perform at a lower cost base while we service our customers very well. 
uh, about how we continue that into 2021, even if things, uh, come back to normal and, and COVID-19 kind of relaxes a little bit, 
savings and about a third due to kind of lower activity due to COVID-19. 
So, um, our, our challenge to ourselves is, uh, you know, can we keep that third, um, you know, savings, uh, due to the COVID-19 lower activity? 
Um, you know, at this time during COVID-19. They do have to change the behavior of the organization to get the value, 
Not only to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, but to serve customers better, operate smarter and more efficiently 
Both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID-19. 
Most of the <inaudible> came from aviation or renewable, with aviation impact mostly driven by COVID-19. 
As described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 and other market dynamics. 
We estimates the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from COVID-19 roughly 700 million. 
This year, we're impacted by our usual seasonality, but also COVID-19, especially in aviation. 
For cashflow in total, we estimate the first quarter impact from COVID-19 of around one billion. The majority of which was health and aviation. 
We remain committed to achieving our leverage targets, but we now expect to achieve those targets over a longer period than previously not due to the impact of COVID-19. 
This was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower shop visits from the impact of COVID-19. 
Operating profit was down 39% organically, primarily on lower volume and negative mix pressure in commercial services from the impact of COVID-19 
Segment margin contracted 650 basis points organically, this was primarily due to COVID-19 impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services. 
issues. Add a bit more color. COVID-19 represents just over half of the year over year margin difference. 
Healthcare order, excluding <unk>, were up 6%, driven by a surge demand related to COVID-19. 
This was partially offset by delays in procurement and lower demand of products, less related to COVID-19. 
This was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from COVID-19. 
The gas power fixed costs were down 9% sequentially and <inaudible> versus prior year. This was more than offset by lower service volume and additional costs from COVID-19 disruption. 
revenue was down 8%, mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones, driven by COVID-19. Operating losses was down 115 million. 
This was driven by the supply chain disruptions, due to COVID-19 for <inaudible> delays and the non-recurrence of the non-gain, non-cash gain from an offshore wind contract termination in the prior year. 
This type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with COVID-19, 
As we all know the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly, hitting hard and hitting fast. 
The COVID-19 dynamics at GE, like the economy at large, are fluid and still evolving, but clearly challenging in the near term. 
With that, I'll start with our response to COVID-19. Carolina, who is joining our Earnings Call for the first time will cover the financials. 
We established a COVID-19 taskforce that 
In healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients, 
Let me share some ways we're doing this. While safety has always been a top priority for GE, COVID-19 has reshaped our safety agenda. 
As I noted, we entered the year with momentum, however, as COVID-19 continued to spread globally, and I'm not going to sugar coat this, 
where COVID-19 costs are rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of March. 
A similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions caused by COVID-19 impacted our field personnel. 
At the same time, healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against COVID-19. 
In healthcare, we've been on the front line combating COVID-19 since the early days in Wuhan. 
In power and renewable energy the impact of COVID-19 has been more limited to date. 
The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19, and we expect that our financial results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year. 
Moreover, I see in our response to COVID-19 signs of how we're moving faster to change GE for the good, 
<unk>, thank you. There's no question that COVID-19 is putting real pressure on our businesses. 
Given that so much has changed, and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from COVID-19. 
in light of COVID-19, Airframers are producing at a lower rate. 
In the second quarter to date, we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 within healthcare systems. 
COVID-19 has highlighted the need to build and truly invest and, and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly. 
I'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat COVID-19. 
In services, approximately 20% of planned averages are shifting from the first half of this year due to COVID-19 field labor constraints. 
there was a limited impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.80% for the second quarter or a hundred basis points lower than the same period, 201. 
including adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. 
In our comments, we'll be discussing net economic earnings, contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted longterm capitalization, 
Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, as of the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year was 19.6 million or 6.7% of sales. 
and EBITDA to be approximately $196 million. 
I guess we'll start with Mark. The first thing I wanted to talk about was, you know, looking at the range for next year, it's a fairly tight range of 500 to 525 million EBITDA, 
<inaudible> and good morning. Um, my first question is just on your EBITDA guidance for 2021. 
During the same period, Illumina generated about $4 billion in EBITDA. GRAIL's 
We generated positive EBITDA and cash from operations for the quarter, 
and record second quarter broadcast cashflow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow with those net metrics growing 28%, 49% 
Please note that on today's call, in addition in discussing the GAAP financial results, we will discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non- GAAP financial measure. 
we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $15 million, 
In line with the price improvement our EBITDA posted a 15% growth during the quarter resulting also from lower maintenance expenses, as well as for my continued effort to renegotiate supply contracts from <inaudible> which led to an increase in the cost of energetic of 8.8% versus the same period of 2019. 
I would also like to emphasize on the EBITDA margin improvement of 4.3%, which is an important achievement in the scenario of lower volumes. 
For the third quarter 2020, our non- GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was positive 11%, with a positive 4% for the trailing 12-month period.
