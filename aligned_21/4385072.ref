Good afternoon and welcome to SiTimes third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. At this time all participants are in listen only mode. 
At the conclusion after this conference call, instructions will be given for the question and answer session 
if anyone… if anyone needs assistance at any time during the conference, please press star key followed by zero on your touch tone telephone. 
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today Wednesday, November 4th, 2020. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Leanne Sievers of Shelton Group Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Good afternoon and welcome to SiTimes third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. 
On the call from SiTime are Rajesh Vashist, Chief Executive Officer and Art Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, the company may make forward-looking statements regarding expected future results including financial position, strategy and plans, future operations, the timing market and other areas of discussion. 
It is not possible for the company's management to predict all risks 
nor can the company assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors 
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. 
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed during this call may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely 
from those anticipated or implied. 
Neither the company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. 
The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements for any reason 
after the date of this call, to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations. 
For more detailed information on risks associated with our business, we refer you to the risk factors described in our 10K filed on March 2nd, 
2020 as well as the company's subsequent filings with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will refer to certain Non- GAAP financial measures, which we consider to be an important measure of company performance. 
These Non- GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAPs. 
The only difference between GAAP and Non- GAAP results is stock-based compensation expense. 
But please refer to the press release issued today for a detailed reconciliation between our GAAP and Non- GAAP financial results. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Rajesh, please go ahead. 
Thank you, Leanne. Uh, good afternoon. We appreciate you joining us today and hope that all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy during these unique times. 
Even with the challenging macro backdrop 
SiTime continue to execute demonstrated by a record quarterly revenue of 32.7 million for third quarter 2020, 
which was above our updated guidance range of 31 to 32 million. 
Our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments, our customer base and the exceptional dedication of the SiTime team, all of which have benefited SiTime during the current environment. 
During this third quarter, revenue grew 52% sequentially compared to our second quarter 2020 revenues. 
We anticipate that continued strength in the fourth quarter will allow for SiTime to set another quarterly revenue record. 
And Art's going to discuss our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook later in the call. 
Now SiTimes fabulous model and multi-source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market 
while at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers. 
In contrast, we believe that the quartz industry infrastructure has several points of failure 
which can cause supply disruptions some of which we have heard about through recent industry commentary. 
Additionally within the timing market, responsiveness is becoming the key theme 
and we believe that many competitors in quartz may not be set up to support industry needs and requirements for the future. 
In infrastructure applications, our speed of response to environmental disruptors such as temperature change minimizes the system level impact. 
In mobile IOT, our kilowatts products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely, something that's unique to SiTime. 
On the supply side our programmability continues to enli… enable the flexibility, speed and delivery required by our customers. 
With the recent introduction of our ApexMEMS family of resonator products 
SiTime now offers all three categories of timing products, which are the oscillators, the clocks and the resonators. 
As of the third quarter we have cumulatively shipped almost two billion oscillators, all of them with an embedded MEMS resonator. 
Our combined knowledge of the MEMS, the analog chips, 
the package and the materials is unique to the industry and offers a system level understanding for our resonator customers as well. 
Now we know that the manufacturing MEMS products in high volume is not easy. 
MEMS product leaders in other markets, non-timing markets, 
maintain their leadership position because they invested early, focused on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well. 
And we believe today that SiTime is in a similar position for the timing market as we continue to build upon this market leadership. 
Our ApexMEMS resonators are ideally suited for high volume, space constrained mobile and IOT applications 
such as Bluetooth <inaudible> high-speed connectivity interfaces, asset tracking and microcontrollers. 
In addition to these applications, other system on a chip vendors can use our ApexMEMS resonators that could be core packaged with their chips, 
just like we do in our oscillators. 
Given a broad knowledge of timing market solutions across all three categories we believe our system timing, our system level timing solutions save customer design time, 
increase the end products performance and reliability 
while also reducing their overall board pri… footprint, uh, creating value. 
Moving to 5G, in 5G the opportunities available to SiTime continue to drive the company's expansion into the communications market. 
Our products continue to see solid design traction in 5G applications at tier 1 manufacturers of telecommunication equipment. 
In addition, we had previously mentioned ORAN which is Open Radio Access Networks, 
and we continue to see significant interest in ORAN hardware solutions that are being developed for Greenfield operators as well as the traditional carriers. 
ORAN is getting traction because it gives operators best in class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics. 
And the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for SiTime success. 
We're getting significant traction with ORAN customers worldwide across the entire radio networks, 
including our use, small sale and distributed units. 
In the area of 5G optical transport, where we are engaged with 100 to 800G optical and SOC suppliers, 
with our SIT 9505… 9501 products 
we find that we are able to offer unique value with high performance in the smallest form factor. 
In conclusion, SiTime is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the first company that continues to provide system level timing solution. 
That said, this is the only the first step of a multi-year strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solution. 
We remain a results driven company with a culture that encourages creativity, leadership and a strong commitment to our customers, 
which continues to be reflected in our recent quarterly trends. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Art as we'll discuss… as he will discuss in more detail our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, Art. 
Um, thanks Rajesh and, uh, good afternoon everyone. 
We are very pleased to be holding our fourth financial results conference call as a public company. 
And during my review today, I'll discuss third quarter 2020 financial results and we'll provide guidance for the fourth quarter. 
I'll focus my discussion on Non- GAAP financial results and refer you to today's press release for a detailed description of our GAAP results 
as well as reconciliation of GAAP to Non- GAAP results, which excludes stock-based compensation and related payroll tax expense. 
So first of all, Q3 was really an excellent quarter for us. 
We had strong revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion and very positive Non- GAAP net income. 
As you know, at the end of August we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter by more than 10% 
and I'm happy to report that actual results exceeded the high end of that revised guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $32.7 million, up 52% sequentially and up 29% over the same quarter a year ago. 
To provide some color on end markets, our report sales by market group as I have in the past. 
The first is mobile IOT and consumer, which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones, wearable devices and consumer products. 
This was the segment most impacted by the global slowdown in Q2, but it came back strong in Q3. 
Sales were $20.9 million or 67, 64% of total sales, 
up 105% sequentially and up 19% over the same quarter a year ago. 
The second is industrial automotive and aerospace, 
which goes into industrial, automotive, aerospace, military applications and includes broad-based sales. 
Sales were $6.4 million or 20% of sales up 5% sequentially and up 23% over the same quarter a year ago. 
The third is communications and enterprise which consists of wireless infrastructure including 5G, data center and networking. 
This was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year. 
Sales were $5.4 million for 16% of sales up 3% sequentially and up 103% year over year. 
We had just one end customer where sales exceeded 10% and sales to that customer were 45% of total sales. 
We've had a number of initiatives within the company to expand gross margins and those initiatives are paying off. 
Non- GAAP gross margins during the quarter were 52.1%, up 530 basis points over Q2. 
Non- GAAP operating expenses were $12.5 million, up 5% sequentially comprised of 7.0 million in R&D 
and 5.5 million in SG&A expense. 
The interest expense was $0.1 million. 
And this generated Non- GAAP net income of $4.4 million or 23 cents per share. 
And that's compared to a loss in the prior quarter of 2.2 million or 14 cents a share. 
Stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were $5.1 million. 
This was higher than the 3.4 million in Q2 due to the higher stock price, 
some new higher stock grants and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan. 
Trade receivables were $17.2 million, that was up from 13.0 million in Q2 due to the higher revenue. 
But DSOs decreased from 58 days in Q2 to just 49 days in Q3. 
Inventory was $15.2 million up slightly from 14.8 million in Q2. 
We generated $4.2 million in cash from operations and used 2.5 million for the purchase of assets. 
We had $35 million in bank debt going into the quarter but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank debt. 
We then ended the quarter with $69.2 million in cash and equivalents. 
I'd now like to provide some guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
We expect Q4 to be another great quarter, 
with continued sequential revenue growth, gross margin expansion and increasing net income. 
We expect fourth quarter revenue will be up 10 to 15% sequentially. 
At the midpoint this would put revenue at about $36.8 million or 30% higher than the same quarter last year. 
We expect continued gross margin expansion with Non- GAAP gross margins increasing to approximately 53% plus or minus a point. 
Operating expenses are expected to increase between eight and 10% sequentially, which at the midpoint would be approximately $13.7 million. 
We will not incur any interest expense since we no longer have any bank debt. 
Income taxes will be nominal and less than 50K for the quarter. The basic share count in Q4 will be approximately 17.0 million shares. 
In addition, the diluted impact of employee RSUs will add approximately 2.2 million shares 
taking the total diluted share count use for our EPS calculation to approximately 19.2 million shares. 
Stock based compensation expense will be approximately $5.5 million up from Q3 due to the higher stock price and a few new higher grants. 
So based on the guidance just given, we expect fourth quarter Non- GAAP EPS will be between 
28 cents and 32 cents per share. 
So in summary, we have an exceptional workforce that is performing extremely well working from home. 
We have truly differentiated products that address large and growing markets. 
We have a number of new products in the pipeline an enviable list of tier 1 customers, 
a strong balance sheet and we're looking forward to a very strong Q4. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator? At this time, I would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. 
Again, that's star one to ask a question. 
We have your first question from Blayne Curtis from Barclays your line's open. Good afternoon guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis congrats on the really nice results. 
Uh, my first question was around, uh, the improvement throughout the quarter. Obviously you updated guidance in late August, possibly and then you're- you're now coming ahead of that range now. 
Um, what most materially improved between now and then? 
Uh, and then if you could look out into December, you're obviously guiding for some more expansion there. Could you give us a little color on segments, uh, between the three where you're seeing that growth sequentially? 
So from Q2 to Q3, as- as I mentioned, the most significant growth was in our mobile IOT group, right? 
Part of that is seasonality but, um, we just had real strengths kind of across the board with our customers in that, in that segment. 
We also mentioned in our, uh, revised… in our press release with our revised guidance in August that we had won a design win, a phone design win 
that also contributed. 
Um, you know, we're not gonna report that the, uh, the phone revenue specifically one, because we're not allowed to but I will provide some color to that. 
When we increased our guidance in August, 
about half of that increase was related to that new phone design win. 
And the, uh, the balance was obviously then, uh, strength in non phone. 
So that, that was kinda what happened in, in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we're seeing very strong revenue growth. Uh, as I mentioned, our guidance is that revenue will be up 10 to 15%. Uh, 
I'll mention the phone again, not specifically, but phone revenue will probably account for about a third of that sequential improvement, 
um, and therefore non phone, uh, basically accounts for the balance of that. 
But we're, we're expecting, uh, growth in all of our market segments going from Q3 to Q4. 
Great, that's super helpful. And then my follow-up is just really around, 
uh, the lar… the largest customer for you guys that obviously stepped up materially into September. Uh, along with that margins clearly stepped up as well. 
Can you talk about what's driving that better margin performance? 
Clearly you're, you're seeing some accretive gross margin dollars, uh, as that customer steps up 
but, uh, can you talk to your other segments as well? Is- is there a material part of that uptick that's also coming from 
the comms enterprise and the auto industrial space as well as, as those products move a 
little… move a little- Oh. Oh, ab- absolutely. 
Ab- absolutely. You know, we've talked for a long time about the gross margin drivers, uh, in our business. 
Um, you know, our newer products generally are higher ASP and higher performance. Uh, as, as those newer products become a larger percentage of our sales 
that drives higher, 
uh, blended gross margins, that's one. 
Two, we're taking more of our sales direct that cuts out the distributor, 
uh, that improves our gross margins. Uh, we've made a lot of progress in reducing our product material costs that would be wafer costs. 
Uh, that improves gross margins. Our ops group has done a great job at, of improving sort and test yields and package costs, that improves gross margins. 
Volume helps us our, our manufacturing overhead. Even though we're fabulous, we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that's relatively fixed. So as the volume goes up, 
uh, that manufacturing overhead is percent of sales decreases, that helps gross margins. 
And so, you know, we- we've been working on this now for, for a while. 
And, you know, we saw very significant gross margin, uh, expansion from Q2 to Q3. As I mentioned, 
gross margins increased 530 basis points from Q2 to Q3 
and, uh, I've guided for at least another point of improvement plus or minus going from Q3 to Q4. Great. Congrats again on the next results guys. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
We have your next question from <inaudible> from <inaudible> your line's open. 
Yes thank you and congratulations on the record results. 
Um, Rajesh you- you- you, um, called out some, some challenges in the, uh, in the quartz industry, you know, your competitors. 
Could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on that 
and, um, what- what does that really mean for sort of new engagements and new design wins for- for SiTime? 
Yeah, I think we talked a little bit about it last time. 
Um, basically the quartz industry as we know has done a stellar job in the last 70 years of providing, uh, product to everybody in the electronics world. 
Uh, but I think, uh, that it is still a batch process. It is a fab process. It's a factory process, or everybody has to invest in factories 
and these factories are purpose made so they can't be used <inaudible> they don't have the scale 
and they don't have the flexibility that a fabulous company like SiTime which uses semiconductors, uh, can get. 
I mean, as a reminder, um, uh, when we build our MEMS resonators, we can, um, a- a- a million, uh, sorry, uh, 
10,000 wafers should give us about a billion units 
and these are 180 nanometer technology wafers so not really that, uh, difficult to get. 
So we… it's fundamentally their supply chain is batch made and I think it has these issues with it. 
There were some reports of some stumbles in fabs in, uh, in, in the Asian markets. 
And I think, uh, we saw a spike in demand coming, 
that didn't impact Q3, by the way. I'm just talking, uh, that we, we saw spikes in people because people get nervous when that happens. And this is not the first time, 
10 years ago there was, uh, a big, um, uh, a big problem with, uh, ceramic packaging. 
As you know, all quartz made products with the oscillators, the resonators are quartz packaged 
because to… because they're fragile and they want to, to keep a very strong packaging. 
Those quartz, uh, packaging, ceramic packages come from only two people in the world and sometimes there's a shortage. So 
I think they have these multiple points of failure potentially. 
Uh, and, uh, that's what I was pointing out too. 
And yeah, there have been some, uh, there have been some, you know, anecdotal, uh, events in the last few months and in the continuing we expect to see that. 
Um, it- it's just a, it's just a reminder to our customers. 
It doesn't significantly change our revenue but what it does is, in the medium to longer term, 
it gets our customers a reminder that they, they're probably better off in moving to more stable supply chains. 
Yeah. That's, that's great, uh, perspective. Thank you for that. 
And as my follow-up, uh, congratulations on, on entering the- the resonator market, uh, and now obviously you- you're, uh, covering the entire gamut of- of the timing market. 
I know in the past you've talked about, uh, targeting, uh, uh, about a $10 billion <inaudible>. If you kind of combined all three sub 
segments, um, could you update us where your sum is now, uh, with your, uh, penetration with new products into the resonator market? 
Yeah, our sum is, it's still around 1 billion to 1.2 billion. 
It might be a little bit higher depending on when, when we introduce products and so on, but it's certainly less than 2 billion. 
Uh, it's also mostly concentrated right now in, um, in oscillators. 
So while we do have resonators that have been introduced, while we do have, um, uh, analog, um, clocking solutions that have been introduced, 
our ramp into that from a revenue point of view, we have already set expectations will be relatively slow. 
I think our entry into these markets is significant for customers, um, in the following way, in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us 
on all of these products 
and not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them. 
Sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or oscillators or clocking. And then that becomes an entry point to talking about other products. 
So it's a, it's… from a TAM point of view we're still pretty tiny, 
uh, you know, one and a half billion in TAM out of a $8 billion total market <inaudible> at one and a half billion <inaudible> out of an 8 billion total TAM. 
And of course SiTimes revenue is, you know, still pretty, pretty small in comparison, you know, at around 100 million. 
Um, so we still, even if we maintained and did not grow our <inaudible> very much, we would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots. 
Thank you for that Rajesh and congratulations again. <crosstalk>. 
We have your next question from Quinn Bolton from Needham your line's open. 
Hey guys congratulations on the, on the nice results. Wanted to start off, uh, with the supply chain issues you've, you talked about with quartz. I believe 
that was one of the factors that led to the, to the phone, uh, win that- that you announced last quarter. 
You know, if you look forward do you think that those quartz supply chain issues are positioning you to potentially win additional skews 
either at, at that customer or other large smartphone vendors? 
I think that'll have some impact Quinn, uh, but I don't think that it's forecastable, uh, 
I think it's a, it's a general slow trend. Uh, and I've talked about this several times. 
It's a general slow trend. It's- it's- it's not at the point where it's gotten… that snowball has become very big but it's a trend that we see 
and we've always said that people design us in for, uh, performance reasons as well as for supply chain. 
But overwhelmingly they design us for performance reasons. 
Uh, just to, just to pick, uh, you know, uh, uh, I would say less than 15% of the time we get designed in, uh, for supply chain reasons. 
But those supply chain reasons are important, 
uh, because when, uh, people look at their supply chains and see these <unk> that happen from time to time and these, by the way, these perturbations are not new, they've been going on for, for a long time. 
But, but customers did not have an alternative. 
Now that they do have an alternative, it just becomes one more faster in their thinking. 
Um, uh, particularly when they're looking further out in time, particularly <inaudible> for example, in automotive or <inaudible>, uh, 
or- or, uh, or, you know, longer term industrial products that have a slow ramp in multiple years. 
Uh, many of them start to think it might be prudent to do that. 
Um, but I would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption. 
Great. And the second question I know, um, with, uh, with the recent introduction of the ApexMEMS family, you're, you're moving into the resonator market, 
are you targeting select frequencies, um, you know, where, you know, high volume frequencies with the initial resonators? Um, and 
I guess a related question, you know, since you design this in silicon, do you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes, 
um, in those resonator structures? Thank you. 
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Uh, we… to answer the second question first. 
We do need, uh, a new mask set, um, but, um, sometimes, uh, those are very similar. 
Uh, they're not, uh, the- the- the design of the resonator is not 
very different. For example, between a 24 megahertz and a 26 megahertz, it's not going to be very different. 
However, between a 24 megahertz and, uh, 76.8 megahertz, I think it could be different. 
Uh, but, uh, generally the good news is that the se… the resonator industry has worked around the quartz limitations in the past. 
And there are basically a handful, maybe two handfuls. So I'll call it a dozen qu- quote, unquote, popular frequencies, uh, that exist. 
And, um, and so I think, uh, that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other. 
And you're absolutely right, we will <inaudible> target the most popular ones but we'll target the ones where 
the frequency is one thing, but where we bring the combination of size, of, uh, of resilience, of, 
uh, environmental stability and clearly of high volume because these are low priced products. They are sub 20 cent products in price 
and so obviously the volume has to be… opportunity has to be in the tens of millions for it to be interesting for us. 
Um, those are some of the key, key reasons to do it. 
Now, there's another thing that's going to happen, uh, over time as frequencies of SOCs increase, 
um, the, the requirement for frequencies beyond say 75 megahertz, uh, increases. 
And that's an area where we think, uh, that quartz technology has, uh, has difficulty getting to, uh, a high volume, high frequency, high reliability, small size product. 
And that's where also we would shine. And I'm thinking two, three, four years out, uh, particularly in consumer products, perhaps some phone applications. Got it. Great. 
Thank you for that additional detail and then just quickly for Art you mentioned each, each of the, uh, segments would grow in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you might be able to 
rank order, um, if one's growing much, much faster than the others or do you expect all of them to, to grow about the same rate? Thank you. 
Sure. Fair, fair question. I don't think we wanted to get that detailed in our, in our guidance. 
We do expect a growth in each one of those segments, 
um, and I'll leave it at that. And, and, uh, we'll, uh, we'll announce that segment growth in, in more detail when we actually announce the fourth quarter. 
Understood, thanks Art. Thanks Quinn. 
We have your next question from <inaudible> from <inaudible> your line's open. <inaudible> congratulations on the strong results. 
So, uh, perhaps for Art would be, uh, increasing mobile, uh, content you have now, 
can you… in this framework we're thinking about seasonality going forward first half, first second half, first Q, 
uh, versus maybe before, um, you know, coming into this year? Sure. 
Well, if you look at, uh, the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality. Go back to last year 2019, right? 
Second half of the year, much stronger than first half people can go back and- and quantify that. 
We saw pretty much the same thing this year. Uh, you know, the back half of this year, much stronger than the first half of this year. 
Q2 of course, was, was somewhat depressed in our mobile and IOT segment because of the global slowdown and the fact that so many retail stores were closed. 
And I think next year it's gonna be somewhat similar, uh, in terms of first half versus second half. 
Obviously we expect, uh, uh, year over year growth, you know, 
Q1 next year should be nicely higher than Q1 of this year. And Q2 over Q2 and three and three and four and four. 
So we, we expect, you know, next year we'll have good growth. We're not quantifying that at this point. 
Uh, but in terms of the seasonality, it's gonna look, I think, similar to how it looked last year and this year. 
Okay Art that's very helpful. And then perhaps on the, um, the infrastructure side, 5G, uh, wireless infrastructure in particular, 
um, are you having design wins kinda showing up every quarter that <inaudible> that be a steady growth driver or might you ebb and flow with the 5G build out, uh, puts and takes? 
Yeah I think it's a slow, steady <inaudible> of products. 
Uh, you know, our, uh, our products are also showing up, you know, we talked about the 9501, uh, we… in the optical module business, that's clearly showing up. 
Uh, the ORAN, uh, that I referred to earlier. I think 
we have, uh, tens of, uh, design wins that showed up in the last, uh, in the last, uh, few months. 
Um, yeah, so, so it's just a steady growth. 
And what I'm excited about is the breadth of where 5G touches. So, again, as I said, it's not just the distribute… the digital unit or the <unk> 
it's, it's the mid haul, the back haul, the microwave, the, 
you know, it's in the servers, it's in, it's all, it's in so much of the infrastructure. 
And as I've mentioned before, this is probably a five, seven year, um, 
rollout and, uh, should be a very, very solid place for SiTime. Helpful color, thank you Rajesh. <inaudible>. 
We have your next question from <inaudible> from William Blair, your line's open. 
Uh, sure maybe a quick question for Art, um, just on operating expenses. Can you update us on the long-term operating mar… um, model and how we should be thinking about it? 
You guys have really had our… done a tremendous job, um, growing revenue, the last couple of quarters with very little, um, opex flow through. 
Yeah. Uh, so I'm wondering, uh, how to think about it. Yeah. Great, great, great question. Well, revenue kinda got ahead of our expenses, so that's, that's a good thing. 
You know, our kind of stated longterm goal is that we would grow opex at about half the rate of top line growth. 
So just for sake of mathematical example, if we were to grow revenue year over year by 20%, then I would expect opex to grow by about 10%. 
So that's kind of a- a- a generalized long-term goal. 
If you look at the last couple of quarters, um, you know, Q2, our revenue went up 52% sequentially but only five… but opex only went up 5% sequentially. 
So, you know, we, we couldn't ramp expenses quite fast enough. 
My guide for Q4, uh, we're guiding revenue up 10 to 15% and I'm guiding opex up eight to 10%. 
So that's a little more than, uh, half the top line rate but that's because of a little bit of a catch-up 
because we were s… so low in terms of, uh, opex growth in Q2. 
So does that, does that kind of frame it for you? Uh, yeah, that helps. Um, and then- And I- I- 
I have a, I have a comment. I have a comment on that. And that comment is that, um, a reminder that SiTime's an analog semiconductor company 
and when you think of other semiconductor companies that are using seven nanometer 
tape-outs, uh, we're doing 180, 130, 65 nanometer tape-outs. Uh, 
when you think of other companies doing a bunch of software in opex in scaling that, um, we're not in the software business or not meaningfully in that. 
On the other hand, uh, the number of opportunities that are coming at us are coming pretty thick and fast. 
So we always would like to retain the ability to invest, uh, at a, at a greater rate, you know, within reason, 
um, to the model that was put out by Art. 
Understood that, that's helpful and a helpful reminder on the, um, on the geometries. 
Um, and then just one more question. I believe last quarter, when you announced the Cascade product, the clock IC product, 
um, that you expected revenue to really be, you know, a 2021 <inaudible>, um, and then probably ramping, um, beyond that. 
As we look at the standalone resonator product, should we thinking about the timeframe to revenue in a, in a similar fashion 
or what are the puts and takes <inaudible> from a customer standpoint? 
Yeah, I would say that's even slower <inaudible>. Okay. Uh, 
I would say that, 
uh, you 
know, be- because, uh, there's two kinds of design wins we would have. We would have standalone design wins, so we would go to, uh, OEMs and sell them resonators, that's one. 
Uh, and then the other one would be to go to SOC vendors, the ones we sort of for example gave, 
and they would design it into their products. 
Both of them, particularly the second one take a long time. 
So the gestation period for that, for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the, uh, clocking business. 
Um, so, um, yeah, so of course there can be other times when it can happen very fast but, uh, but generally that's a good rule of thumb. 
Um, that's helpful. Uh, that's it for me. Thank you. Thanks Alex. 
We have your next question from Ch- Chris Castle from Raymond James, your line's open. 
Yes, thank you. Good evening. Um, I guess the question on, on margins 
and, um, uh, I- I- 
I guess as we go forward into next year, there's a lot of different factors with, um, uh, seasonality. 
Uh, some of the different margin profiles or the different segments that are gonna move in seasonality. Could you give us a sense of, 
you know, what, what should we expect as we go through the year, particularly in the first half of next year as some of the, uh, consumer related products, uh, you know, typically would be seemingly weaker? 
Yeah. Great, great question. 
So, you know, our longterm goal for gross margins that we've talked about, is getting gross margins somewhere closer to 60% 
and that's gonna take us two to three years, give or take. 
So, you know, if you just kinda do that math, you know, we're- we're targeting gross margin expansion of maybe three points a year. 
Now we obviously did much better than that going from Q2 to Q3, 
but, you know, just for the next couple of years, if we can add three points, we get to 60% margin, um, you know, in, in two to three years. 
Within a year, there are some dynamics that affect gross margins by quarter. 
And you're right in the first half of the year, generally our mobile IOT and consumer business which is, uh, somewhat lower gross margin not that much lower but a little bit lower, 
would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the first half of the year just because of mix. 
But the counter to that is, we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side. 
So taking all of that into account, just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the first half, 
I would expect the same thing next year. 
So if you're modeling this, I would model gross margins to what you think it would be for the year in total, margins will be higher in the back half than they will be in the first half. 
Right. And- and that's as the, the, the, the, the poor mix is offset by the higher at, 
uh, uh, manufacturing efficiencies in the second half of the year. Right. And, and the volume, uh, is, is a little heavier weighting. So, uh, 
I would actually expect gross margins to- to pull back just a little bit in the first half of next year 
but I expect them to be much stronger in the back half of next year, uh, even stronger of course than they are in the back half of this year. 
All right, that's very helpful. Thank you. 
Um, a- as a follow-up, um, uh, perhaps you could talk to us about, you know, kinda what you're targeting for next year and there's a lot of opportunities in- in front of you, 
uh, you know, wha… in- in- in terms of, what do you expect, wha- what do you expect to drive the growth next year? 
And, uh, uh, the- the- the- there's a lot on your plate, there's a lot of opportunity there. What are the things we should be paying attention to most closely as we go into next year? Um, 
I think the market, um, that we, the market trends that we have outlined continue. 
So purely comms enterprise data centers are a big play. 
Um, uh, we are continuing to find, uh, more traction in automotive, uh, as more and more, uh, electric vehicles show up. 'Cause a lot of automated driving 
is happening in that. 
Uh, we have a nice little story and connection growing in the middle aerospace market. 
And then finally, uh, the mobile IOT piece <inaudible> the consumer, the mobile IOT piece of it is always a natural place for SiTimes growth, 
uh, because, you know, the size, the resiliency, the performance. 
So I- I think, uh, we're also, um, continuing to expand our customer base. 
You know, five years ago we were, uh, addressing about 2,000 customers. Today, we're about five X that, maybe a little bit more. And, uh, so 
I think the expansion of customer base, this is not the big customers. 
This is customers that are of much, much smaller size where we are working in the channel to, to connect with them. 
I think that's a, that's a good initiative for SiTime as well. 
So I think those are some ways that we think about it. Great very helpful. Thank you. Great, thanks Chris. 
I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Arthur Chadwick, sir, please continue. Great. 
Well, we wanna thank everybody for joining us today on the call 
and, uh, we hope that you have a great day and, uh, thanks again for all your support. 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day, you may all disconnect.
