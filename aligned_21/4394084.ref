Morning, this is Geoff Hedrick. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 220- 
2020, the current business conditions and our outlook for the coming year. 
Joining me are Shahram Askarpour, our president and Rell Winand, our CFO. 
Before I begin, I'll ask Rell to read the safe habour <inaudible> re- message. 
Thank you Geoff, and good morning everyone. 
I will remind our listeners that certain matters discussed in the conference call today, 
including new products and operational financial results for future periods 
are forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, 
either better or worse from those discussed. 
Including other risks and uncertainties reflected in our company's 10K, which is on file with the SEC and other public filings. Now I'll return the call back to Geoff. 
Thank you Relland. 
A couple years ago, I announced we would change our approach to the market by focusing on only products that are techno- technologically driven, performance and price advantages. 
And I'm pleased that our operating performance during this challenging period appears to validate our change in direction. 
The fourth quarter had a strong finish resulting in year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and sequential growth. 
Our revenues increased 31% from a year ago, the quarter full year revenue growth was 23%. 
Fiscal 2020 was our second consecutive year of strong growth, 
of increasing profitability, solid cash flow and while strengthening the underlying foundations of OEM production contracts and recurring revenue that support our continued success. 
Based on this performance, our cash on hand and our confidence in continued success, 
in September, the Board of Directors declared a special 65 cent per share dividend. 
We were able to receive these, uh, achieve these results while protecting our employees, partners and customers against the pandemic. 
While this, 
while its impact to date on our business has been minimal, 
safety precautions have now been a routine, have now become a routine part of our operators commitment to ensure a 
safe and a healthy work environment. 
We announced last quarter that Textron had awarded us an OEM production contract to supply 
our ThrustSense Autothrottle with LifeGuard protection on the new King Air 360 twin turboprop. 
In November, Textron celebrated delivery of its first Beechcraft King Air 360 Tur- turboprop aircraft. 
More recently, Textron announced that the ThrustSense Autothrottle is standard equipment on the new King Air 260. 
Delivery is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2021. 
We are pleased to be working with Textron and are grateful for the support through the certification and mobile potential production. 
They're a strong supporter of our technology. 
The IS&S Autothrottle is the first among a list 
of 360 up- upgrades mentioned in their King Air 360 promotional material. 
Textron joins two major OEMs to feature IS&S products as standard equipment on their production aircraft, 
joining Pilatus PC-24 UMS and Boeing's KC-46 tanker 
as major OEM contracts 
of prospectively significant duration and value. 
These contracts offer a growing base of long term recurring revenue as expected for the last 50 years. 
They're supporting Textron in looking into opportunities for the ThrustSense work 
load reducing features on their other production platforms. 
We're grateful to see that the service center organization 
has positively pursued significant retrofit opportunities of thousands of King Airs currently in service. 
Consequently, we are working with Textron to ensure our production levels 
meet the service center's demand for Autothrottle and help promote the availability of this potentially lifesaving technology 
to King Air's owners. 
ThrustSense also has a base for expanding beyond the general aviation market. 
They'll look at the military aircraft and air transports and multi engine aircraft as well. 
In addition, we are finding that the public publicities around, surrounding our ThrustSense has 
then created interest for other OEMs 
that are potentially lifes- are potentially lifesaving FAA certified one engine and operative 
upset protection, it's by compelling differentiator that multi engine operators are now very interested in. 
We're, we 
are optimistic that the contracts with Textron support provide this option of a technology that not only improves their air performance, but to provide unparalleled safety. 
Precipitated by our King Air business, we have hired a sales and services support representative stationed in Wichita. 
He will support our present business at Textron and explore new business opportunities in the region. 
We are working with Textron worldwide service organization, supporting all of our retrofits. 
Our autopilot programs director is successful dressing- addressing a 
large military opportunities and air transport markets with very encouraging results. 
Continue to recruit sales and support personnel, uh, for our growing business demand 
and for ThrustSense Autothrottle and LifeGuard Protection Systems. 
In addition, 
September of 2020, we announced the FAA had certified our synthetic vision installation and Autothrottle upgrade for the Eclipse jet. The 
Eclipse has, 
the Eclipse was the first aircraft in which we developed an Autothrottle and we are pleased to be able to offer owners the ability to upgrade the airplanes with our latest features. 
The ongoing growth of, the ongoing growth of online traffic 
continues to fuel the increase in the number of 757s and 67 aircraft being converted to cargo. 
This has generated increasing demand for our flat panel display technology. 
Engineering and development work completed, we ship our upgrades for the US 
Navy, um, Air Data Computers, um, for the F5 in the fourth quarter. 
We are now merging international customers for the F5. 
Let me turn this over Rell- to Rell for some, uh, uh, financial results. Thank you Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. 
Looking first at the fourth quarter revenues were 6.3 million up 31% from 4.8 million a year ago, 
and generated a 39% increase in operating income. 
This was the fastest quarterly growth in this fiscal year. 
Growth this quarter was almost entirely on product and customer service revenue as we completed final engineering on the US Navy F5 Air Data Computer development contract 
and we shipped the entire production order in the quarter. 
Growth margins for the quarter were 55.8% down from 59.5 in the year ago 
October, with a decrease attributable to product mix, high warranty and material costs. 
Also this quarter we had limited engineering development revenue, unlike a year ago quarter which yield, yielded strong margins. 
Nevertheless, margins remain in line with historical averages achieved over the years. 
Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were 2.3 million up from 2 million in the year ago quarter. 
This minus increase in expense reflects the additional, the additional resources needed to support the company's 30% revenue growth rate. 
Research and development expense was up over the year ago quarter, reflecting a shift to more internally funded R&D now that the customer funded F-5 development contract is completed. 
R&D was approximately 11% of quarterly revenues, which is consistent with our strong commitment to innovative and new product development. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were up about 8% from the year ago quarter, again, looking at primarily due to the need to have resources to support our increased business activity. 
For the quarter we generated upper in income of 1.2 million or approximately 19% of revenue. 
Other income was down from a year ago quarter as interest rates increased. We reported quarterly and income of 1.2 million or seven cents per share. 
Looking at results for the year where total revenues were 21.6 million up 23% from 17.6 million, for full year 2019. 
The cover report for fiscal 2020 net income of 3.3 million or 19 cents per share, increases 74 and 73% respectively from net income of 1.9 
or 11 cents per share for fiscal 2019. 
The company remains in strong financial position, 
we generated over 2.2 million of funded tax flow from operations in fiscal 2020 of which 1.6 million was generated in the fourth quarter 
and had 12.6 million of cash on hand at September 30, 2020. 
The company is debt free. 
In September, the Board of Directors declared a tax dividend in the amount of 65 cents per share or approximately 11.2 million which was paid on October 1, 2020. 
The dividend appears as an accrual on the September 30, 2020 balance sheet, offset by corresponding restricting cash. 
We believe that the company has sufficient cash to fund operations for the foreseeable future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Shahram. 
Thank you Relland and good morning everyone. 
The fourth quarter was our best sales quarter of fiscal 2020 
and put a 5 point on our second consecutive year above our bottom line growth, a strong tax generation. 
Fourth quarter was the year in which 
our third OEM production contract with a tier one manufacturer, Textron. 
King Air 360 and King Air 260, 
are newer crafts that will feature our ThrustSense Autothrottle as standard equipment 
going or ongoing all year contracts with Pilatus and Boeing. 
This OEM contracts we are building a solid foundation of internal revenue that will last for years. 
Let me also quickly reiterate what Geoff mentioned earlier. 
Generation is stronger and profitability 
is successfully executed on the King Air contract 
while implementing new safety policies and procedures that have kept all of our employees safe and productive as well as protected our partners and customers. 
The King Air 360 program is just wrapping up the first production aircraft delivered to a customer last month. 
The King Air 260 is scheduled for delivery in the first half of 2021. 
We have been shaping ThrustSense units Textron since third quarter and expect orders to naturally follow the anticipated increase in production over time. 
In addition to shipping here for installation and routine here is restricted, 
we're also shipping units extra distribution to the service center where they have reduced for retrofit installations. 
As Geoff mentioned the retrofit opportunity is much greater than the <inaudible> with 
about 5000 King Air's currently in service, 
which we estimate represents about 300 million total addressable market. 
At this point, we are certified for retrofit on the Beechcraft King Air 300 series equipped with Pro Line 
Fusion avionics and the Pro Line 21-equipped Beechcraft King Air 200 series. 
Other variations of this STC are being pursued with some imminence. 
We are consequently also shipping autothrottles to our installation partners, where it appears many King Air owners take their aircraft for service. 
Both organizations are aggressively marketing the retrofits. 
In fact we are opening an office in Wichita to not only promote the product but also support Textron. 
The relationship with Textron is going well and provides a solid foundation from which we expand our autothrottle market, not 
only horizontally across King Air platforms, but other OEMs as well as the military. 
We are in conversations with manufacturers of both twin turboprop, 
twin jet and multi-engine aircraft with regards to our autothrottle. 
Potentially lifesaving nature of ThrustSense on multi-engine aircraft is a feature in which virtually all OEMs have an interest. 
In September 2020, December 2020, we announced that the FAA has certified our Synthetic Vision installation and Autothrottle Upgrade for the Eclipse Jet. 
This installation marks IS&S's first upgrade directly to Eclipse owners and involves substantial pre orders. 
Eclipse owners 
now have the benefit of significant functional upgrades and ongoing product support directly from the partnership with IS&S 
I will now briefly review some of our ongoing programs. 
The PC-24 program has essentially reached steady-state production levels. 
We expect to ship close to 50 shipsets in fiscal 2021 to support their current production rate. 
This program remains highly successful. Pilatus is very excited about our performance. 
This program, we believe, is expected to continue to run for many years, offering a predictable, stable, recurrent revenue stream. 
Dynamics in the commercial and transport market are also essentially unchanged. Their cargo delivery services continue to convert Boeing 757 and 767 planes, including upgrades to our flat panel displays. 
Once contracted with large installers we are now doing more direct sales to carriers, which has proven much more successful. 
There remains over 1,000 operational 75 and 767s that are still in need of retro fitting and even larger number of 737s 
yet to be updated. 
Development work for the US Navy F-5 data computer was completed, and we delivered production units for the US Navy fleet 
retrofit in the fourth quarter. 
This was a highly successful program, and we are now turning our attention to foreign military, which also fly the F-5, 
and would be 
a large new market for this versatile product. 
Our KC-46 program with Boeing is one of our three OEM production contracts. 
It continues to make steady contribution to our recurring revenue and profitability. 
New orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 
were over 3.4 million and backlog as of September 30, 2020 was 3.6. 
Bookings for the full year were in excess of 19 million. 
Keep in mind that backlog at the end of any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of future business activity 
as we generate a good portion of our revenue from customer service and intra-quarter booking ship orders. 
The ongoing pandemic has had peripheral effect on our sales and marketing activities, limiting our ability to personally meet with customers and prospects, 
causing some complexity working with the FAA, which is operating under work-from-home directive. 
<inaudible>, we 
do not believe the pandemic has, or will have a significant impact on our business and are excited about the prospects of our portfolio of our products. 
Let me turn the call back to Geoff for some closing remarks. 
Thanks Shahram. While the success of our Autothrottle strongly suggests that this strategy is creating real value for both our customers 
and for our stockholders. 
We're entering a new fiscal year 
with momentum for two years of strong growth, solid balance sheet and a portfolio of products that are receiving en- enthusiastic market perception. 
We see a great opportunity. Thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement. Thank you to the audience today. 
I'll take the question as required. 
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. 
If you're using a speaker phone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. 
To withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
And the first question will come from David Campbell with Thompson Davidson company. Please go ahead. 
Good morning David. Hey, good morning, Geoff, Rell and Shahram. Thanks for having such a good quarter. 
I just wanted to ask you, Rell, about, what do you assume, what I should assume for accrued tax rate 
in fiscal ' 21? 
Will there be end-of-day tax accruals? Yeah, 
there'll be some expense, but it'll be less than because we still have some NOLs and some R&D tax credits. So I would use, 
I'm estimating use like a 5% effective tax rate type of thing. 
Okay. Thanks. 
Thanks. And, uh, Geoff and, uh, Shahram, uh, were any of the 
shipments to the King Airs, were any of them for, were some OEM and some retrofits? Or all retrofits? 
We have both. A lot of, a lot of OEM actually, about 20 odd OEM shipments obviously the airplanes haven't come off the line yet, but, um, and then, and 
then a very a very rapidly growing demand and retrofit. 
But no retrofit then revenues yet? <crosstalk>. 
Actually Textron did an installation in Australia on a retrofit on, uh, using our 
autothrottle. We've had a good number of them. We've had, you know, their local service centers, 
they have a huge network of service centers throughout the world. 
And, um, the very encouraging thing is they are very aggressively, um, promoting the autothrottle retrofit. 
So it looks as, it looks better almost every day. 
It's very good. Uh, so you expect that to be, uh, so you expect those revenues to increase in fiscal ' 21? Pretty much so. 
And we believe that the growth is gonna be exponential. 
Right, right. The usuals, this quarter, the December quarter, we'll have the usual seasonal 
downturn, is that correct? 
Yeah, maybe we'll do a little better. Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for answering the questions 
that- We're trying to do it, we're trying to do better. We're trying to keep a more stable and straight growth. 
Look, we had operation is good. It generates cash every- every day, virtually. It's excellent. 
It was profitable. And as our volume goes up, it becomes more profitable, 
not only because it covers all of the fixed overheads, a lot of which affects precedent profitability. 
So we're very optimistic about the future. We're very pleased about Textron's interest and support in our products, 
and, um, and see a large retrofit opportunity. 
Listen, we're already, we're delivering 57, 67 
systems to another, a- a very new demand for, um, for package carriers. 
So I mean it's, the business is coming up. And when you consider the other effects 
of 
pandemic, if you look at most of aerospace companies have been struggling. We've done really well. 
Well, uh, you're doing, you're doing a great job, thanks for all your help. 
If I can do it when I won't be to do this coming year and a little struggle, looking a lot better. Um, I, 
I think we're fortunate we have a very good product that is very producible. 
We've got a great customers. Um, all of our customers are outstanding. Um, we're very fortunate with that. 
So we just keep working at it. You know, every day get up and, and, uh, as Marine's say, kick and take names. 
Thanks a lot for answering the questions. I gotta get off from the call but I appreciate all the work you're doing. Thank you. 
Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one. 
The next question is from Roger Goldman, a private investor, please go ahead. 
Good morning and while, and first of all, thanks for a great quarter and a great year, um, validates my late father's trust in you, as you know, 
um, and my sister and I are much appreciative. I also wanna acknowledge 
the fact that, 
uh, the last quarter in the last year of history, but it sounds like you guys have set the company up for fabulous growth in the future that 
without being Pollyanna could make the past look like small potatoes. 
So congratulations on that. Um, my question as it usually is, goes to the use of cash. 
We've got a company with no debt with solid operating profit, 
um, and, and even after the dividend, a fair amount of cash on the books. 
Uh, any thoughts of either, uh, an acquisition or a small, regular cash dividends that 
I think would have a great impact on the stock price? 
It's a good question. Um, some of that I can answer some of it you can- No I know you can't, I know you can't. But it's a reasonable question. Absolutely. 
Look, we have, we know we generate a lot of cash. 
And our interest is for operating the business not, 
not for us to look at cash that doesn't generate any income at all. 
I mean, I personally have cash accounts that they're, they're paying interest at in pennies, 
so, um- Yep, yep, yep. We have no interest in doing that anymore. 
Um, if we can reasonably invested in other things, we're doing some, some, uh, automation on the floor and, and, and capex kind of things. 
Um, we are actually looking at dividends on a long-term basis because we believe that to be business itself will generate cash on a regular basis. 
And that we, uh, moving that, that our stockholders can make good use of, of cash. So we're conscious. We're very conscious of that. 
Um, that's, that's what precipitated the 65 cent. Yes. 
And yet we continue to look at it, especially in light of what might be changes in, um, uh, taxation policy. 
Exactly. Yeah. That's all, that's all I can ask for. And again, uh, well done, you guys are doing a great job of positioning this company for the future. 
You miss your dad. He was always fun. And he's a good guy. 
Well, thank you. We miss him too. We miss him too, but, uh, I, I'm hoping after COVID, Geoff to come on out there and meet you guys and spend some time. 
So, um, look forward to it. <inaudible>. Okay. Thank you, 
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Thank you. Uh, it appears that, uh, our management line has been disconnected. 
So we thank you everyone for joining today's presentation. Uh, the call has been completed and you may now disconnect. Take care.
