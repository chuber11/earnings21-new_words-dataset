Good morning, and welcome to Q3 2020 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. 
My name is Sinara and I'll be the operator for today's call. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. 
Later, we'll conduct a question and answer session. During the question and answer session, if you have a question please press star then one on your touch-tone phone. 
Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Ellen DeSanctis. Ms. Denc- DeSanctis, you many begin. 
Thanks, Sinara. Hello and welcome this morning to our listeners. 
I'll first introduce the members of the ConocoPhillips Executive Team who are on today's call. 
We have Ryan Lance, our chairman and CEO; 
Matt Fox, our EVP and chief operating officer; Bill Bullock, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; 
we have Dominic Macklon, our senior vice president of Strategy, Exploration and Technology; and Nick Olds, our senior vice president of Global Operation. 
Ryan will open this morning with some prepared remarks and then the team will take your questions. 
Before I turn the call over to Ryan, a few reminders. 
In conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted a short deck of supplemental material, uh, regarding the quarter onto our website, that's available for your access. 
Next, we will make some forward looking 
statements this morning based on current expectations as well statements about the proposed business combination announced last week between ConocoPhillips and Concho. 
A description of the r- risks associated with forward looking statements and other important information about the proposed transaction can be found in today's press release, 
all of which are incorporated by reference for purposed of this call. 
We'll also refer to some non-gap financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gap measure 
can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website. 
Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Ryan. 
Uh, thank you, Ellen. And good morning to our listeners. 
Uh, before we get into our third quarter results, I'll take a few minutes to address last week's announcement of our combination with Concho Resources. 
We spent a lot of time talking to the market over the past several days, and I'm pleased to say that the feedback has been positive. 
By the way, earlier this week we added some annotations to our transaction deck for clarification. 
Today's call is a great opportunity to reflect on our conversations and reiterate the compelling merits of the transaction for both sets of shareholders. 
I'll start at the highest level. Our announced transaction with Concho combines two widely recognized leaders in the sector. 
ConocoPhillips has been a recognized leader in the returns on and returns of capital model for the business, 
and Concho has been a recognized leader in the Permian pure play class. 
Yep, while we're both best-in-class companies on a stand-alone basis, by scaling up our existing returns focused business model 
we're stronger and more investable within the sector characterized by frequent price cycles, industry maturity, capital intensity and ESG focus. 
We'll be a nearly $60 billion enterprise that is uniquely positioned to create sustained value by embracing what we believe are the three essential future mandates for our sector. 
And these mandates are first, providing affordable energy to the world; second, committed 
to ESG excellence; and third, delivering competitive returns. 
We believe the transaction accelerates our ability to successfully and simultaneously deliver on all three of these mandates, that's how we will win. 
Now let me take these mandates one by one in the context of our transaction. 
In all future energy scenarios we know the world will need hydrocarbons as part of the energy mix for a long time, 
even as we see increasing adoption of low carbon energy sources. 
However, we also recognize that the energy transition means the winners will be those companies with resources that can be affordably developed 
in a transition… in any transition scenario including a less than two degrees scenario, 
that's the reason we've always been committed to having the lowest cost of supply resource base in the industry. 
The company will have a 23 day <inaudible> resource base for the cost of supply less than $40 a barrel. 
Concho gets the benefits of our global, diverse and lower capital intensity portfolio attributes. 
ConocoPhillips gets the benefits of adding some of the best resources in the world. 
And by the way, we've studied rock quality everywhere. 
Now, let's move on to the next mandate, a commitment to ESG excellence. 
In conjunction with last week's transaction, we announced we're adopting a Paris-Aligned Climate Risk Framework, 
we're the first U.S. based oil and gas company to do so. 
Our framework includes specific emissions intensity reduction goals, 
a commitment to no routine flaring, permanently installed methane monitoring and advocating for a well designed carbon price in the U.S. 
And this framework is inservice to our ambition to reach a net-zero operational emissions target by 205. 
Now, we've been asked at our engagement meetings if this framework included the portfolio facts of the Concho assets. 
The explicit answer is no. We were preparing to issue our new climate risk framework before the transaction was agreed. 
However, we see the addition of Concho's assets as being consistent with and equative to these goals. 
The production emission of the U.S. unconventionals are among the lowest GHG intensity assets in the world, 
so the addition of these resources will be a benefit to our projections, plans and targets. 
Now, the third mandate, delivering competitive returns, is an imperative for attracting and retaining investors to the sector. 
Our company has been all about returns and that won't change. 
In fact, the combined company will be uniquely positioned to deliver on the proven returns focused value proposition we know investors want from our sector 
because there's several advantage attributes and demonstrated priorities. For example, 
as I just described, the transaction creates a massive resilient low cost of supply resource base. 
I discussed this as part of mandate one, 
but I'll also add that low cost of supply is the best assurance, by definition, for delivering competitive financial returns through price cycles. 
After the deal closes we'll publish our combined cost of supply curve. I have no doubt it will be best in class. 
By the way, we've been asked about how we view risk in the event of a change in leadership in Washington. 
Our view is that while it might create some headwinds for the industry, our company's global diversification and our mix of private, state and federal leases in the U.S. 
assures that we're competitively positioned for that outcome, 
and we accounted for this potential risk in our evaluation of the overall transaction. 
Diversification and low capital intensity matters. And as I just mentioned, we preserve those portfolio characteristics. 
Adding Concho's unconventional assets into our portfolio will not make a material difference to our base decline rate, 
that means we retain our diversification and low capital intensity advantage for the benefit of both shareholders. 
We'll apply our disciplined, consistent approach to future investment programs. 
Capital will be allocated first on a basis of cost of supply and then based on secondary criteria such as flexibility, capital intensity, 
asset optimization, affordability and free cash flow generation. 
And our expanded Permian program resulting from the transaction will be integrated within the total company plan to optimize overall outcomes and value. 
The combination creates greater visibility on earnings expansion and free cashflow generation. 
Factoring in our announced 500 million targeted cost and capital savings, 
the transaction is lucrative on all key consensus financial metrics, including earnings, free cashflow and free cashflow yield. 
Finally, our strong balance sheet plus free cashflow generation means we're even better positioned to give investors what they want from this business, returns of capital. 
The transaction enhances our ability to meet our stated targets of returning more than 30% of our CFO to our owners annually. 
And this target isn't an ambition, it's what we've been doing for the past four years. 
In fact, we returned over 40% of our CFO to owners over that period and it will remain a key part of our future offering. 
The bottom line, this transaction creates a best-in-class competitor scaled to thrive in a new energy future 
that is compelling for shareholders for both companies. 
Now, a few comments on what to expect next. Our S-4 filing should be filed in the next couple of weeks. You may expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 202. 
Integration planning is already underway. Dominic Macklon will lead the effort for ConocoPhillips and Will Giraud will lead the effort for Concho. 
Both sides are excited and committed to a very successful integration. 
As part of the integration planning, we'll begin to evaluate how best to optimize our future investment programs. 
We would expect to announce pro forma CapEx for next year shortly after closing. 
But directionally, on a stand-alone ConocoPhillips basis, we remain cautious on the pace and timing of recovery. 
So, as a place to start, we're currently thinking we enter 2021 CapEx 
at a level that is roughly similar to this year's capital, meaning little to no production growth on a stand-alone basis. 
Of course, we retain the flexibility to adjust as the year progresses. 
We have the capital flexibility, the balance sheet and the cash on hand to respond as necessary to changes in the macro while meeting our capital return priority. 
And that brings me to a few comments on the third quarter results. 
It's certainly been a <inaudible> year for the business, as we all know. The company took some significant actions to respond to the downturn, including production curtailments. 
And over the past couple of quarters, we also carried out our major seasonal turnarounds. 
So a bit of noise in the second quarter and third quarter numbers. 
But by the end of the third quarter the curtailment program was behind us, the seasonal turnarounds were complete and the underlying business was running very well. 
As you saw in this morning's release, third quarter results were in alignment with expectations. 
We've reinstated guidance that you should think of… and you should take the fourth quarter as the new baseline for ' 21 capital and production; 
though as I just mentioned, that's subject to ongoing monitoring and market conditions. 
We look forward to keeping you updated on integration progress and our future plans for the business. 
And finally, we hope everyone is safe and well. And now I'll turn it over to the operator for Q & A. 
Thank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. 
If you have a question please press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers. 
Once again, if you have a question please press then one on your touch-tone phone. Waiting on standby for any questions. 
And our first question comes from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Yes, hello. Um, first question, just wanted to ask about the quarter here. 
Um, it looks like there's some moving pieces around cash flows, uh, affiliate distributions and some other factors there. 
So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there and help us think about how you would define a… the clean CFO in the quarter. 
Yeah, thanks Phil. I'll let, uh… Bill, Bill Bullock can answer that for you, thanks. 
Hi, Phil. So, yeah, for the… for the quarter, cash from operations, X working capital was about 1 billion 230 million. 
And we had a couple of one time benefits i- in the quarter, a, a legal settlement and an audit settlement totalling 130 million of that. 
But we also, uh, uh, had curtailments in the quarter of about, uh, 90,000 barrels a day, so the foregone cash flow for that 
would have been about $150 million of cash. 
So if you think of a, a, a clean run rate number for the, for the quarter, a good place to be thinking is about 1 billion 250 million for the quarter. 
Now, you, you asked about equity distributions. We didn't have a distribution from APLNG in the quarter. 
We received distributions, uh, uh, in… through the second quarter of about 500 million from APLNG. 
And for the remainder of the year we're expecting a little under 200 million in the fourth quarter, that would give a full year distribution of somewhere around 680-700 million for the year. 
Okay, great. Very helpful. Um, 
I guess this kinda delv- delves into my second question, which is, um, you know, we continue to get some questions here around this pro forma CFO guidance that you provided. 
Um, and so if I look at the res- results you've just talked about, the 1.25, 
um, and what Concho reported the other night, which I think ex-hedges, is around 50. 
Um, perhaps you could help us bridge these results which I think are about $41 WTI to, um, to the seven billion 
$40 WTI guidance that you provided. 
Yeah, thanks, Phil. I know there's a, a number of moving parts there as you described and, 
uh, yeah, we've had a few people point out that they thought the seven billion at $40 a barrel for the combined company looked a, a little bit light. 
So now that we've seen the third quarter, if you adjust for Concho's hedging and what Bill just described on our equity affiliates, 
I think you get something closer to mid to high sevens, you know, at, at $40.0. 
So, maybe I'll, I'll Matt add a little bit of color to, uh, uh, those details. Yeah, the, the… 
If you, if you look at the clean third quarter and the… for, for both companies, Bill explained the, the errors, 
that we comply somewhere between 7.5 and 7.8 at $40 a barrel. 
Now, that, the range is basically, the, based on the uncertainty in the equity affiliates distribution. 
If you go similar distributions to, eh, eh, this year, we'll be the top end in that range. 
Um, 
and, these, these, these numbers also include the pro forma assumption that we get a full year of expected cost saving and that we are now <inaudible> 150 million of cash, and that's what shows up in these numbers, is also the 150 million of capital that doesn't, um, doesn't affect CFO directly. 
Does that, does that help, Phil? I'll take that as a yes. 
I hope so <laugh>. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open. Good morning everybody. 
Morning, 
Doug. Um, w- one of the, the hallmarks, Ryan, of Conoco and Phillips before the merger, and even after the split in 2012, has been incorporate agility, 
is the way I'd like to think about it, and the ability to create value and strategic transactions over the near and medium-term periods. 
And on this point, while you guys have been pretty clear about the operating and capital cost benefits that you're gonna get as well as some of the enhancements that you're gonna get form 
a 
higher quality investment portfolio, my, my question is whether there are areas that you're optimistic about that may or may not be as obvious to stand and deliver 
further upside areas that you're confident about, 
similar to situations that you had in the past with other 
transactions. And then, second, what are the two to three most important things that you think that the new management group brings to the organization? So two questions. 
Yeah, thanks, Doug. I'll, uh, maybe start to let Dominic, uh, add a few, few comments, <inaudible>. You know, when we put out the synergy number, we, 
we see a lot of other synergy numbers that people put out there and, uh, it seems like a fair amount of arm waving. 
We want to be pretty specific about 
the $500 million that, uh, that we 
describe. But, i- if you're… the second page, which I think is what you're alluding to a little bit, then I can let Dominic, 
uh, add on, is we, yeah, we fully expect that we are going to get, uh, additional opportunity either through price uplift or various other forms to, uh, add, add, add incremental value to this transaction. 
Dominic, maybe you could describe, uh, a little bit of what the integration team is gonna be looking at. 
Yeah, thanks, uh, thanks Ryan and Doug, uh, thanks for the question. 
You know, actually, we're very focused on delivering the 500 million that we have put out there as a commitment. 
But certainly, we see opportunity beyond that. I think we can outline those in our, in our in our deck, uh, 
I think just to talk more about those specifically. I think the ones that we're most optimistic about, 
you know, on the marketing side, Concho typically sells product to the wellhead, 
we sell further down the value chain to improve realization. So, you know, we have a very strong commercial group at 
ConocoPhillips, so, uh, we're certainly exited about, about that. 
You 
know, Concho have been doing extremely well in the Permian on the delaying completion costs, the performance has been excellence, and, uh, they're further down thee learning curve than us there. So we do expect to see that accelerate, you know, the performance on, on our acreage, too. And, of course, we expect 
to, you know, improve performance across the Lower 48 from sharing best practices and technologies between Eagle Ford and the Permian, and The Bakken, and son on. So, 
definitely operational efficiencies. 
And then on the supply chain side, obviously, we're gonna have increased purchasing power, scale, flexibility, 
so we're anticipating, you know, uh, upside in all these areas and, and some additional areas too, 
that, that, uh, w- w- w- we will be working on in the, in the coming months here. So, Will and I are already talking about these, 
we're pretty excited about it, and, 
uh, we'll be… look forward to see how these develop through next year. 
And maybe your last question, uh, Doug, uh, so Dominic mentioned Will <inaudible> and then what Tim… You know, 
what we really appreciate out of what they bring to our company is some incredible Permian expertise and experience. 
They have the networks, 
they 
have broadened and deeper networks than we, we really have in, in the Permian given their long time, uh, association and, and presence there, and what Tim's built is a, is, you know, two or three goes at it, and what he's done over the last 30 years in the Permian Basin. And I'll tell you that 
I've a lot of conversation with CEOs over the course of the last couple of years and what I've come to appreciate, Tim shares a, a passion for this business and a vision 
for what's gonna… what it's going to take to be successful over the next decade and beyond, 
that is really consistent with, with my view or our view of what it's gonna take, uh, to, to really succeed and beat the competition. 
So, and then I'd say finally, probably, you know, we're both very committed to a successful deal and, 
and we're both, uh, committed to getting the secret sauce that is ConocoPhillips combined with the secret sauce that is Concho and make something that's even better going forward. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Great. Thank guys. I appreciate, uh, you guys taking the questions. 
So the first is a follow up on, <crosstalk> uh, d- uh, distributions, including from APLNG, but just equity affiliates broadly. 
Just how do you, how you think about that? You made a comment in the deck that we shouldn't expect that to be rateable. 
Can you talk about different oil price levels and, and, and how we should be thinking about modeling those distributions coming into the business? 
Yeah, sure, Neil, this is Bill. Uh, 
I think a- a- as you're thinking about equity affiliates that, that… We, we've talked in the past at how they aren't rateable. 
Uh, you should be thinking about the distributions from APLNG i- in terms of being, uh, more significant in the second and fourth quarter a- and lighter in the first and third. 
Um, but as you think about them going into next year and you look at more like strip prices for next year, if you think 
in terms of the range of 600-800 million from equity affiliates a- at those kind of pricing, 
that's gonna… that gets you in the, the ballpark. 
It obviously depends on how their performing o- o- on, in terms of the markets and how we're, um, optimizing our capital over in APLNG, but that will get you pretty close. 
Great, Bill. And, and, and, Ryan as a follow up- <crosstalk> And, and just, just as a reminder we… Just as a reminder, Neil, we do have a sensitivity for that i- in our price deck, 
for the pricing. That's right. That's right. Yeah. <crosstalk> In the supplemental materials we included today. 
<crosstalk> Great, 
guys. Yeah, go ahead, Neil, you had a second follow up? Yeah. It w- it was really just about Alaska, and, uh, I know we're a couple of days away from the elections but, 
which is probably a very sensitive topic, but just sort of your, your temperature, uh, on, on, uh, on the Fair Share Act, and just, in general, your, your message around Alaska as you think about the, the cadence and spend and, and investment there. 
Yeah, you bet. I'll let… Uh, Matt's, uh… Ma- Matt's been following that closely. I have to, but, uh, Matt's got a… can, can answer. 
Yeah, Neil, the, the… As you know the, the, the… really three <inaudible> 
that 
are topical just now; there's the ballot initiative to increase the production tax, there's the status of the Willow project and as the impact, if any, on, of a change in administration, if that happens, on federal land permitting. 
So probably should talk about <inaudible> so that we can hopeful clear up Alaska with this, w- with this one, um, eh, one question. The… 
So, as you know, the ballot measure would impose a tax increase in production, 
uh, the, uh… And that's gonna have two problems, two adverse the- effects. 
It's gonna reduce the competitiveness of investment in Alaska, and it's gonna increase uncertainty and instability. 
Um, so, that, that's not gonna be good. 
And we've got years of development opportunities left in Alaska, but, but a shift of capital from Alaska to elsewhere is gonna be rational if taxes are increased. 
I mean, this is a production tax, 
and what you tax more you get less of. So, that should be expected if the, if the, if those advocating for this and voting for the proposal should understand that. 
And we've been pretty clear <inaudible> to avoid any doubt in Alaska that if the measure passes, 
drilling in the big three fields, they are the targets of the tax increase, 
is not gonna resume in 2021 and, uh, maybe beyond that. So the, uh, you know, 
Alaska jobs, contract labor, all the associated services are gonna be adversely impacted by this change. 
And the contractors, the unions, all the other businesses up there understand us and they've opposed, for the most part, opposing the, uh, the change in the taxation. But 
it's now up to the electorate to decide and, um, elections have consequences. 
So we're getting down to the wire here and we really feel as if we have to be, we have to be clear with the, uh, Alaska voters. 
On the Willow project itself, the, the, we, we passed like a big milestone earlier this week. We got a favorable record of the session from the, the DLM 
after more than two years of, uh, process. 
So that keeps us on track with the project timeline. 
And, and it's worth understand that, that, that permit was received under the 2013, 
uh, 
Integrated Activity Plan for the National Petroleum Reserve, and those are rules that were set under the Obama admini- administration, so they should stand up well to scrutiny under a change in administration if that happens. 
So we're, we're working towards a, a concept selection and moving to feed by the end of this year, 
of course that assumes the ballot measure fails and taxes are not increased. If it passes, we'll, uh, we'll need to reconsider the timing 
because although Willow isn't directly 
targeted by the tax increases, there's gonna be knock-on effects on the other fields because of the lack of, uh, available, available capital. 
And then the last one is the federal land, um, permitting in Alaska. The, uh, um… You know, more generally, if there's a change in administration, 
we would expect that to have a relatively limited impact on us. I mean, although 65% of our acreage is no federal land, it only represents about 5% of the production. 
Now, <inaudible> production GMT-2, in particular, uh, is on federal land but it's well underway, 
first production will be at the end of next year, so we don't accept that will, will be affected at all. 
Willow's on federal land, of course, 
um, uh, but neither Willow nor GMT-1 or GMT-2, the federal land, uh, drill sites, is, 
uh, <inaudible> conventional <inaudible> to simulation techniques. 
So if the issue is about fracking they, they shouldn't be influenced by that. 
Um, so I guess… We've been clear to the Alaska electorate about the implications of Ballot Measure . 
We except any implications of a change in administration to, in D.C. to have a relatively limited impact on us. Thank you. 
Our next question comes from Jenine Wai from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Hi. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking our call. <crosstalk> 
Good morning Jenine. Good morning. 
Uh, maybe, sorry, just one more on Alaska, if I could real quick, following up on Neil's question. 
Um, it, it's a little bit different, but, 
I mean, last year on the Analyst Day you talked about how Willow would be contingent upon selling down 25% of your position in Alaska, 
and we know that you need resolution on Ballot Measure 1 first. 
Uh, but is that 25% sell-down still the case now that you have Concho assets in the portfolio? 
And then, maybe just on that, um, for the Ballot Measure 1, 
we know it's a citizen's ballot measure and do you think that it could be likely that the legislature would potentially overturn any decisions? Em- 
Yeah, Jenine, this is Matt, Matt again. 
Uh, we didn't, we didn't really say it was the explicitly <inaudible> Willow decision to sell them, um, they, they… But, but, we, we're still anticipating that we will do a sell down 
in 
Alaska, we just slowed the timing of that down until we get some of these, uh, uncertainties resolved. So it's still on the cards that we'll make, uh, an adjustment to equity, um, uh, in the, 
uh, in Alaska, um, but, but we may still continue to proceed with the project in the mean time, uh, so, so, so, so the, the timing of the project doesn't impinge on the sell down, I guess, is what I'm, I'm saying. 
On the, um, uh, Ballot Measure 1 and can the… could the legislature overrule that? 
Um, not, not really, not, not, not <inaudible> for that. They would have to come up with, uh, 
an alternative that was, that was, uh, that was, substantially similar, uh, or, 
or, or, the, they, um… Um, so it wouldn't be… I- it's unlikely that there would be an overturn turn at the, um, you know, <inaudible>. 
Okay, great, that's really helpful. 
Thank you very much. Um, my follow up question is just on the cash allocation priorities. Uh, you indicated in your prepared remarks that 2021 CapEx 
should be about similar to 2020 with little to know production growth. 
Um, the strip moves around a lot, it's kind of moving against us all today. 
Um, but is the right way, generally to think about it, is that in the mid 40s threshold, that, that threshold that you have for production growth, it's a hard and fast criteria that needs to be met? 
Or are there just a bunch of other considerations that we would need to factor into the decision making process? Yeah, 
I think we… You know, as I t- tried to describe, we basically use cost of supply, and I think is we, is we think about the, the forward curve or, 
uh, in thinking about our plans for 202. And again, I, I mentioned those on a stand-alone basis for ConocoPhillips, that's kinda how we're thinking about it going into next year. 
You know, it's just not, not cost of supply but it's also what, what kind of cash flow are we projecting to, to make 
and, uh, you know, we, we have the, 
we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet, so we can use some of that should we need to. But y- certainly we'd be also trying to balance, uh, the, the cash we're making with the CapEx that we're spending and the, and the dividend that, uh, today, uh, uh, satisfies 30% of our return criteria and more, 
given the kinds of prices that we're seeing. 
So certainly, some headwinds into the, uh, commodity price outlook right now. 
Some, 
uh… You know, with COVID resurgence some demand certainly hasn't started to recover and depending on what NOPEC or OPEC does on, on the supply side and what the U.S. response is, you know, we're watching all of that really closely to make sure that whatever program we put in place for ' 21 we can balance with the cash flows that we expect and make sure that we are investing in the 
lowest cost of supply things that we have in the portfolio only. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Silverstein form Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
<inaudible>, thanks <inaudible>, maybe just <inaudible> off that, that last 
question there, you mentioned that, um, you know, for <inaudible> CapEx, it will be very similar, uh, on the year over year basis. 
What would the <inaudible> look like relative to the, the fourth quarter <inaudible>, uh, under that scenario? 
Uh, yeah, Josh, the, the, the, we would, 
we would be… we would expect under that scenario to be, um, similar to fourth q- or second half, eh, eh, eh, of the year 
<inaudible>, that, that sort of level. 
So that would be r- are- roughly 4.3, is what we're spending this year, um, which is a bit above our sustaining capital. 
Um, the, the, so, so let, let me take the opportunity to clear that up. 
The, the, the, it's flat production and yet above our sustaining capital, so let me try and maybe explain why that's different. 
So if, if we were, if we were gonna execute a long-term sustaining strategy for the company, 
um, the, the, we need about 3.8 for, for, for, for ConocoPhillips, uh, to 
stand-alone and that would sustain production a- a- at . r- roughly, you know, just below 1.2 millions <inaudible>. The, uh, 
um… But, but the low cost of supply that we have in the portfolio, we don't expect our long-term strategy will be to simply sustain production. 
The, the, the, the investment opportunities are, are too competitive for that. 
But what Ryan is really indicating is that we could execute a tactical sustaining program, much like we have this year, 
and, and, and, and start 2020 with that sort of tactical, um, uh, sustaining program and then see how demand recovery and supply responses shape out. 
And what, probably the, the distinction between a s- tactical and strategic sustaining program is, in a tactic sustaining program we would still keep, um, production flat 
but we will completely shut down, uh, projects like Willow, our exploration activity, 
uh, those, those things will still continue, like, with the anticipation that the, uh, ultimately we'd move away from simply sustaining, uh, back to some modest growth. 
So those are the things that we are working through just now, and the, and the plan. 
And as Ryan said, we, we, you shouldn't expect us to communicate 2021 capital guidance certainly for the combined company till sometime after the transaction closed. Thanks, Matt. 
Thanks <crosstalk>. Yeah and 
I would… Yeah and I would add, add Josh, you know, we have a lot of flexibility with the balance sheet, which is why, 
you know, if we go in at a similar level of capital to this year and, you know, 
and maybe flat to modest growth, so it doesn't necessary equal flat production at the, at the capital level going in next year. But, 
uh, that's something we'll, we'll continue to watch, is that, is that macro evolves around us. Y- yes, sir. 
And then you mentioned that the, you know, the Lower 48 assets are, I guess, unconventional assets, 
are the, the lowest emission part of the portfolio and, uh, the Concho assets only add to that. Uh, 
I'm curious what the highest emission asset, and does any sort of, you know, <inaudible> from the international portfolio. 
Um, do you think about <inaudible> in, in that regard as well, as maybe those are <inaudible> candidates, that kind of accelerates the goal towards getting to your, your 2030 path? 
Yes, so the, the, the, the highest emissions assets on the portfolio <inaudible> in the operating portfolio is really, is, uh, Oil Sands, the… 
That's why we are so focused on, on, uh, looking at ways to bring Oil Sands's emissions down 
and, uh, and we've got a lot of, uh, <inaudible> in the file there. 
Um, we're gonna, we're gonna extend our non-condensable gas injection which brings down steam-oil ratio, uh, by keeping heat in the reservoir. 
And, of course, it's the steam-oil ratio that, that, that drives the, the emission intensity. 
Eh, we're also gonna be deploying, um, more, uh, uh, 
of these full-control devices that bring, that brings the steam-oil ratio down. We're moving to, uh, add some sustaining pads, as some of pads get older, the steam-oil ratio increases. 
When you put new pads on, the <inaudible> will be very low steam-oil ratio. 
And there's other technologies that we're looking at there, as well. 
So what, what we're doing, basically across the board, is we're looking at all of our, um, uh, uh, greenhouse gases intensity across every asset that we have, 
and were asking ourselves, What can we do, um, to cost effectively bring that down? 
The, the, uh, and that's what our… we bring that process together in what we call our marginal abatement cost curve. 
Um, and, uh, we have about 100 projects in there just now. Like, some of them desktop exercises, <inaudible>, they are feasibility studies. 
Uh, we spent about $90 million this year between capital and operating costs on those projects. 
Um, they are, um… But, but we look across the asset base to try and find ways to bring that down. 
And our targets, Josh, you know, that we established the 35-45 % reduction, that 
doesn't require major portfolio changes to go do that. 
So we're, we're not talking about having to sell certain assets that, that Matt described, that's, that's things that we have identified inside the portfolio to work on, 
with the portfolio being relatively constant over this time. 
Yeah, it's actually… That's a good point, Ryan. It's mostly driven by the fact that we're, 
uh, s- s- s- strategic <inaudible> where we're investing. We're investing in lower, uh, cap- uh, uh, greenhouse gas intensity places 
like the unconventionals in the U.S. and Canada, 
um, uh, like Willow up in Alaska, it's very low intensity as well. 
So the percentage of, of production that's very low intensity increases with time, 
and when you combine that with reducing the emissions and transfer the existing assets like the Oil Sands, 
uh, that's how we deliver the, the, uh, uh, the reduction in, uh, emissions intensity over the next 10 years. 
It's not, it's not, uh- <crosstalk> 
And we've said that it's, it's… And Matt described sort of the, the cost and capital is, is, is small amounts to get to <inaudible>. We're not talking about spending hundreds of millions in dollars capital to go to deliver this. This is, uh, 
small projects that, uh, that are currently baked into our plans. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rodger Reed from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Hey, thank you and good morning. Morning, Rodger. Just, uh, 
I'd like to, to kick on, really, kind of a follow up of what you're talking about with Josh there. As you think about ' 21 CapEx roughly 
applied you said, you know, you ought to be nimble next for, for hat comes. 
What, uh, what will be the things you would looking at? 
I mean, presumably not simply oil price up or down, I mean it's… I assume it's some macro factors, 
um, maybe help us kind of understand some of the signals you might look for for getting more optimistic in ' 2. 
Yeah, I mean, it would, it would be, uh, macro. We have to, we have to see how the, 
uh, 
uh, how the demand responds to, you know, what looks like, uh, uh, the slower response than people were hoping for, um, and especially with Europe and possibly the U.S, coming. 
So 
we, we have to just be cautious about that. We have look at how the, uh, the… Russian and OPEC can respond. I mean, they, they, they, the have a <inaudible> coming up in the end of November, 
uh, and see I may go back to sort of drawing, the, the inventory. 
So, the beauty of our position is that we've got incredible flexibility. 
We've got the low, a low breakeven price to cover, you know, for flat production and, uh, to cover the dividends, uh, that's sustained when we put the two companies together. 
Um, so we're, we're, we're actually… having that flexibility and ability to respond to, 
um, for the market <inaudible> is, uh, is very helpful. 
So we're not gonna rush headlong into, into trying to grown production, <inaudible> that doesn't make sense to us. 
We'll see how things play here over the next, uh, you know, several months, 
and then we'll make, we'll make adjustment, the, the, the, the, between our low breakeven and our balance sheet, we'll be in, we'll be in very good shape to, to, to, to assess that as we go through. <crosstalk>. Sorry, 
I would add, Rodger, that, uh, well, it's, it's, 
it's not so much even just what, what's the strip look like and what it looks like for next year. 
It, uh, it's, it's sort of the longer term trajectory back to what, what we believe is, is a reasonable mid-cycle price and we'll, we'll be reassessing what that mid-cycle looks like 
depending on where the demand and supply fundamentals start to kinda shake out with the U.S. tidal going down, 
you know, what happens to the election in, in Alaska. And then 
it's gonna make, it's gonna make imminent amount of sense as we combine with Concho to, to optimize and, and figure out what the, what the right level of activity is between the two companies. 
So there's… You, you're right, there's a number of factors that we'll be putting into the mix as we look at not only at 2021 plans but, but then couple 
or three years look like as we, as this business recovers back to a mid-cycle, and whether it overshoots or undershoots. 
Well, it's the oil industry so it will definitely do one or the other and maybe both. 
Um, one quick, uh, kind of follow up unrelated to the first question but related to the merger: 
Some of the savings, uh, that you p- that you cited were gonna be, you know, uh, exploration appraisal spending that doesn't have to happen. 
I was curious, for the assets that you won't be spending E & A money on in the near future, 
do they just go back into the resource base or is that something that maybe becomes more likely to be, uh, disposed of, you know, or monetized, uh, in a different way? 
Yeah, Rodger, it's Dominic here. Thank you. 
So, uh, what we said was that we will continue focusing our exploration effort on our existing business units such as Alaska, Norway and Malaysia. 
So that will allow us to about half our exploration capital from 300 -15. So those, 
those, uh, areas such as, uh, you know, down in South America, Colombia, Argentina, and so one, 
we will be working sort of managed exists from those areas. 
Of course, we have a lot of value there, we see a lot of value, there's a lot of good, good acreage there 
but, um, we'll be working to, uh, preserve value as we think about, uh, how, how to, um, uh, you know, exit those areas in, in the future. 
So more a question of, uh, dispositions in a managed way rather than those resources staying in the portfolio. 
We have such a strong portfolio, we will with Poncho, uh, you know, that, uh, we just think it's appropriate that we focus the exploration effort. 
And we manage those <crosstalk> where there, there's not the- there's not excessive capital employed, associated with, uh, those assets. But we'll… As Dominic said, we'll… 
we're gonna do everything we can to monetize them as, as best we can. 
And, and we don't have any resource associated with any of those assets on the moment. A- a- a- on our supply curve there's no resource associated with <inaudible>. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Thanks. Uh, could, could you give us some color on, you know, na- U.S. natural gas price has been pretty strong and, and is 
there ability for Conoco to flex, you know, for that a little bit 
or is there… You know, where, where, where is your opportunity outside of associated or, or is that really the opportunity? 
Yeah, I think the op- main opportunity with us, Scott, is associated gas. We probably have a little bit in the Anadarko Basin but that's not capturing a lot of our capital right now. 
So, um, it, it mostly, for us, we're still a pretty big, uh, uh, big marketer so we, uh, we were moving, you know, over 8 BCF of gas a day, 
so we see, see a lot of that. 
So we're getting, we're getting some up, uplift on the commercial side of business with some of the transport 
capacity we have that takes gas from that takes gas from the Permian to the West Coast, and dow- down South to Arizona and even, even into Mexico. So, 
that's how we're kind of taking advantage of, of the kind of market as we see it today and… But on, just on absolute production side, we're not looking to ramp up, 
you know, dry gas and it's mostly coming from the associated gas with the, the unconventional production. 
Yeah, could, d- do, do you, could you quantify some of the marketing, you know, benefits you all see? 
<inaudible> let Bill, uh, he's heard of our commercial organization, to maybe provide a bit of color there. 
Yeah, sure, so uh… Um, Scott, we, we have a very active commercial organization. 
Ryan mentioned that we're moving a little over 8 BCF a day, we're the fifth largest gas marketer in the U.S. 
and we provide a variety of services to, um, various customers ranging from asset management agreements to, 
to offtake agreements, and that's provides an ability to one, have insight into the market 
and also to gain margin across moving across pipelines. 
So, we, we continue to look at that and continue to move and we, we're shipping gas for a, a, a, a profit. 
Uh, so, you know, out of that 800… eight, 8 BCF a day, 
you know, 500 million cubic feet a day of it i- is ours, the rest of it is third party volume. 
And, so we're in and out the market on both sides on a daily basis. 
Thank you. Our next question comes form Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Oh, thanks. Good morning everybody. Um, 
I wonder… Uh, Bill, maybe I could start off with you and as you to 
maybe elaborate a little bit on Ryan's comments around the potential election outcomes, and 
I'm thinking specifically about tax. Um, I'm sure you guys have looked at this, 
but the thing that strikes me as a little bit disturbing is the potential for a minimum 15% P & L tax, that puts in 
wells, you know, you know, under a bit of spotlight. I'm just wondering have thought any way about that, any scenarios that you've run, uh, outcomes that you may expect. 
Yeah, sure. Um, we've certainly taken a look a- a- at the various tax proposals out there, including the Biden tax proposal. 
There's, there's two primary elements of that that, that would impact us, 
Doug. And the first one is obvious, the change in the corporate tax rate from 21-28 %. 
And the second one that would be fairly significant would be removal of 
IDCs, particularly in our capital program a- a- and needing to, uh, depreciate those overtime. 
Those are the two main aspects, as we look through it, that really would have an impact on us. Yeah, 
I guess I should have been clearer, I was talking about a potential Biden administration. And, 
uh, m- maybe as a, as a follow up and I, and I know it's something that is, is a little too obvious but we don't, maybe, ask it enough. 
Ryan, when, when yourself and when Matt put together the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that, uh, that you laid out at the Strategy Day, 
um, we've now seen what we think is a lot of signs of a bottom… you know, cycle to coming to a, a, a bottom, if you like, with consolidation, yourselves being part of that. 
How, how does this, what you're seeing right now beyond COVID, 
um, influence your thoughts on longer terms supply/demand as you think about scenario planning? I'll leave it there. Thanks. 
Yeah, thank Doug. I'll maybe add a few comments and Matt can jump in as, as well. 
But, uh, yeah, we, we spent a lot of time trying to think about what the trajectory of the recovery looks like 
and probably a couple of competing factors. We certainly, uh, see demand recovery. We are uncertain whether it gets fully back to 100 million barrels a day 
but, uh, probably taking a, a bit of, uh, bit of time to, to get there. 
And then, uh, I think equally important and maybe overlooked a little bit is what's happening on the supply side, 
maybe masked a little bit today by dark inventory but, um, you know, when the declines and the declines are hitting in and it was masked by curtailments coming back on, 
you know, there's gonna be a drop in U.S. supply as well. 
So I can… Matt can probably chime in and, uh, 
describe a little bit about the net effect to, uh, the scenarios that we're thinking about as we, uh, debate our capital program and how much to, to put back to work. Yeah, 
Doug, if… I mean, the, the… I think you and I have discussed 
this 
in the past, that the, uh… If you look at the, uh, our expectations for the exit rate for this year for U.S. tight oil, it's somewhere between 6.5 and 7 million barrels a day. And the <inaudible> calibration on that <inaudible> as we approach the end of the year. 
So that compare to over 8 million barrels a day in December last year, 8.2. 
Um, and, and, and to some extent that, that drop flatters to deceive 
because 
people were still bri- bringing wells on in the first quarter and into the second quarter at the, uh… So there's a significant underlying decline going on here. If we model this <inaudible> the, the strip price is in the, in the low 40s. 
Um, we think the industry is going to struggle to maintain flat production at December's rates through ' 21 and into ' 2. ' 
21 will get a bit of lift from the ducks and, but the… But, but if <inaudible> is going live within cash flow, 
there's gonna be a real challenge <inaudible> to, um, to see tight oil at 7 million barrels a day, 
and this is likely to be less than that in 2021 and 202. 
If you compare that to the trajectory we were on that's at least 4 million barrels a day less than the pre- COVID 
trend, and that's just U.S. tight oil. Um, we respond more quickly here because of the decline rates and the capital flexibility but that… but the similar issues are happening elsewhere. 
So also- although there's definitely uncertainty on how much the demand effect will be, 
um… it's likely to be less of a demand effect than a supply effect, certainly over next few years. 
So, the, the, the premise of your question, initially your, Are we setting up for the bottom of a cycle here? Uh, w- w- w- it certainly feels that way because… and 
the… Now, exactly when it turns will be dependent upon the, 
um, uh, uh, demand and, and the COVID and how… what OPEC do in the short-term. But, 
the… We're certainly setting up for a tight, tighter supply/demand balance in a year or so, uh, if not before that. 
Yeah, so, so short/medium-term, all about demand. Medium/longer-term, you know, uh, supply starts to enter the picture as Matt described 
and, huh, we have a couple of, a couple of two/three scenarios around how we, how we think with that slope in, 
uh, trajectory looks like. Thank you. 
Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Hey, guys. Good morning. Uh- Morning Paul. One is that, uh… Maybe it's a little bit of a curve ball here. 
Uh, if we look at trading and optimization, or commercial operation; 
historically, that U.S. looking at that, at a cost center, mainly for facilitation. 
The Europeans, on the other hand take a more aggressive and looking at it as a profit 
center. Uh, and they seems doing quite well and have a good logic to trade around your physical assets. 
So from that stand point, uh, will Conoco, uh, should look at 
that operation and see whether that, it will allow you, uh, to have a higher performance and higher return? 
Or that you think, uh, facilitation is better and you don't want to take on that swing in earnings, uh, and a higher risk? 
So that's the first question. 
Uh, the second question. Uh, with the, uh… Let's, for argument, say if you decide, 
uh, your longer term, 10 year plan has changed due to different market conditions and that such that your future growth rate is going to be lower. 
With the addition of the Concho assets, what other asset in your portfolio, uh, would take more of the back seat and seeing lesser capital investment? 
Uh, you, you can say, say the, uh, the number one, number on two on that, 
uh, if that's possible, thank you. 
Yeah, so let me take the, the first one and, 
uh, maybe Matt can chime in on the second one on the capital investment. So the first one, yeah. Yeah, we're looking at the commercial space and with the addition of Concho, 
you know, it is a, as you described Paul, kind of a cost center inside of the company but, 
you know, we're, we're looking at expanding that, uh, you know, as we think about the, the future and what the Concho assets brings. 
I think, as Dominic described earlier, they, they sell mostly at the wellheads, so we've got some opportunity to add value there to both the gas and the oil side. 
Um, we're building more export capacity as a company and, uh… and in fact we've done some sales to, uh… point sales to customers, where we take the middle man out of the equation, and we found that quite 
margin 
enhancing as we go forward as well. So with the growing U.S. production, uh, that we would have with the combination with Concho, it absolutely represents a, 
uh, uh, a big part of, 
uh, of how we can expand the commercial organization and think about it differently too. I mean, 
Bill described the market share that we have already 
and, uh, that's only gonna get, uh, bigger as, as we go forward. 
So, uh, we're looking for more contribution from the, uh, the commercial side across the whole, whole portfolio. 
Uh, maybe, Matt, if you wanna take the capital allocation as a result of, uh, integrating the Concho assets. 
You know, again I got back to, uh, it's a, it's a cost of supply primary criteria but Matt can provide a bit more details about 
what, what might fall out. 
Yeah, Paul, a- the, the, the… As you know, what we do is we try to optimize each of our individual, each of an individual parts of a portfolio, uh, to get the optimum piece, 
um, using a, 
a set of decision criteria 
but the most important of which is that we're not gonna invest above an incremental cost of supply of $40 
a barrel and we described that, uh, at some length back in November of last year. 
And so we look at the optimization of each and then we put it together and we, uh, and we maybe make a few adjustments but we're trying to honor the optimum in each of the assets. 
Um, now, there is flexibility across the portfolio in the pace. You can… we can adjust the pace of any given project by… You know, so we 
can adjust, uh, the, the rate of which we increase the ramp and the number of rigs. So 
I wouldn't call out any specific asset. If we decide that we want to grow at 2% instead of 4% or, you know, something like that, 
the, uh, then there's flexibility across the portfolio to do that and, uh, and still honor our, our, our criteria, that, that wouldn't bust the criteria. 
The obvious places are Lower 48 to Alaska, that's where the flexibility mostly exists and, uh, maybe in, in Canada as well. But 
I wouldn't, um, I wouldn't really call it a specific asset. We, we, we, we're trying to do an… We're trying to optimize across the portfolio. 
But the, the issue is, if, if you're not optimizing across a diverse portfolio then you're, uh, you're not maximizing the value that the diversification brings you. 
So we, we, we, uh… uh, we're… That's what we're trying to do, is to make sure that we're, we're running each of these assets at their optimum. 
Thank you. Our next question comes form Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead, you line is open. Good morning. 
Thanks for taking my questions. 
Uh, my first one is on ESG and the, the Paris-Aligned Climate Risk Strategy. And I, I think your commentary earlier 
answered a lot of what I'm looking for, you know, with the Oil Sands specific examples and, and just your comments on investments decisions. 
Uh, but is there anything incremental you can share at this point on, on other operational changes that you're undertaking, uh, and focusing on for the, the broader portfolio? 
Just trying to get a sense for the, the scope of some of these projects you've mentioned, again, in terms of what's in focus, whether that's, you know, new technology around monitoring, 
uh, retrofitting equipment for emissions control or, or what have you. 
Yeah, thanks. It's Dominic here, I'll just, uh, take that. You know, uh… You know, recently I, I, 
I was, uh, pretty much involved in the Lower 48 and, and there's some really, um, some, some important progress we're making there. 
I think, um… You know, I think that we, we, we, uh, a- announced a couple of things here along with our new, uh, Paris-aligned strategy. 
One was, um, you, you know, uh, commitment to zero routine flaring, 
and 
that's the World Bank initiative there, so we're committed to that. And the other was the introduction of, uh, continuous methane monitoring. So this is a real break through for us, we're able to do now, this now at a very reasonable cost. 
And we're able to now, basically, um, uh, on our key sites we'll have this implemented and g- we'll have about 65% of our Lower 48 production covered, 
um, by early next year. 
And this technology, at very low cost, allows us to, uh, sample the emissions around sites, uh, looking for methane every 15 seconds, 
and from that we can respond very quickly to any, uh, aberrations that we can address very quickly. 
So the- the- those are, um, a couple of really important initiatives for us that contribute to that overall, 
uh, commitment we have to reduce, um, our GHG intensity by 35-45 %, uh, by 
203. 
And we're really a fast mover on this, as you know, um, Jeoff, you know, uh, 
we were the first U.S. based oil g- oil and gas company to set a GHG intensity target and were the first 
U.S. based oil and gas company to, uh, to commit to being Paris-aligned. 
Thank you. Our next question comes form Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Thanks for the question. Uh, two quick ones, both, uh, regarding Europe, uh, guess it's about 10% of your gas volumes. 
You know, n- n- no one is accustomed to seeing North Sea gas prices below $3 an mcf but we've had that the last two quarters. 
Uh, is that a… is that COVID related, uh, demand situation or is there something more structural in that market? Uh, I, 
I think that… this is Bill. I think that as you think about that, that's, 
that's more of what we've seen with COVID related demand related issues right now as we think long-term, the macro supply around the world. 
Uh, we, we, we would see markets, 
uh, tend to more arbitrage off of the U.S. Gulf Coast with LNG markets, uh, starting to move volumes both into Europe and into Asia as the incremental barrel. So I, 
I think that what you're seeing, it is a short-term response to supply/demand and not a long-term structural change. Okay. 
And to follow up on that, 
um, in about six weeks, the European Climate Law will be approved by the EU leaders, which will make the North Sea 
the, the one part of your portfolio that, that is covered by a, a net-zero mandate. 
Does that change anything in terms of you're thinking about that asset given the de-carbonization targets, uh, for, uh, the EU as a whole? 
No. Not, not really. I think we're continuing to make adjustments but what we're left with in the Europe portfolio is our Norwegian assets, 
and, uh, you know, it's some of 
the lowest carbon intensity assets that we have that are off shore, and, and looking at other options to continue to, uh, reduce our emissions through electrification and, uh, additions there. 
But, as we look at it, 
it's, it's, it's minimal addition to the cost of supply 
and it's quite manageable and Norway is still, is very competitive in the portfolio. 
Sinara, this is Ellen. We'll go ahead and take our last question if you don't mind. Thank you. 
Absolutely. Thank you. Our next question comes from Philips Johnston from Capital One. Please go ahead, your line is now open. 
Hey, guys. Thanks. Just one question from me and it relates to your future return, uh, of capital to shareholders. 
Um, in the last five years you guys have repurchased a little over $10 billion dollars worth of stock at an average price of around $62 a share. 
But at today's share price the paper loss on that program is pretty substantial. Um, 
I realize you guys plan to repurchase more stock here in the fourth quarter but I 
wanted to ask if there's any appetite at the board level to, 
uh, s- to scrap the idea of share repurchases and instead, uh, pursue a fixed plus variable dividend strategy, uh, that 
would target paying out a, a certain percentage of your free cash flow directly to shareholders each quarters. Yeah. 
I think the… You know, the most important things is your last piece of that, where we are targeting over 30% of cash back to the shareholder. 
That's what we've committed to and delivered on in excess over the last three to four years since we kinda came out to re-establish a new value proposition for this business. 
And I think the dividend today is certainly covering a, a large share of that. 
Also think that buying our shares back at this kind of level is, is an important thing to do too because, 
uh, shares are certainly well undervalued and certainly relative to where we think that cycle price should be. So 
I don't think we'll give up on share repurchases completely. 
You made a real point. I mean, we, we wanted to buy, buy our shares through, through the cycle and, 
uh, this was a pretty significant downturn with curtailed production and, and the like going on in the second quarter, 
so we did suspend for, for a while. We wanted to restart up because the, the benefit to really buying your shares in not just buy them 
when you're at, at, at, at mid-cycle price but continue to buy them through the low, low, low end of the cycle because that's what brings down the average cost of your, your shares, obviously. 
So, we still think it, uh, it's gonna be, uh, a, a piece of our return to shareholder pie. 
And the question begins, you know, what happens 
on, 
on future excess returns when… if, if there's another big cycle and, uh, we, we start to exceed our mid-cycle price call? And, uh, we, we, we've had conversations around that with the market 
and we continue to look at all the different ways to do that and continue to open to all the different ways to that. But <inaudible>, uh, the dividend more than satisfies our return to share holders. 
Thank you. <crosstalk> We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ellen. Thank you. 
Great. Thanks, Sinara. Thanks to our listeners. By all means, uh, reach back to us if you have any follow questions and we really appreciate your 
interest and support in ConocoPhillips. Thank you. 
Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentleman. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. <silence>.
