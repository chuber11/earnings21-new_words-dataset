asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 3.02-10.27: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Exco Technologies Limited first quarter resorts 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 11.55-20.80: At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 20.96-23.06: You will need your press card and one on your telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 23.86-30.65: Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance, please press star then zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 31.57-37.70: I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Darren Kirk, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 39.34-46.93: Thank you, Towanda. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Exco Technology's fiscal 2022 first quarter conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 47.47-49.59: I am Darren Kirk, CEO of Xco. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 50.13-52.19: I will lead off with an operations overview. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 52.79-58.84: Matthew Posno, our CFO, will then review the financial results before we open the call for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 59.92-64.06: Before I begin, I would like to make some comments about forward-looking information. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 64.70-72.61: In yesterday's news release and on page two of the presentation that we have posted to our website, you'll find cautionary notes in that regard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 73.29-78.20: While I won't repeat the contents, I want to emphasize that they apply to this discussion today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 79.08-83.34: So it was a challenging quarter with several factors catching up to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 83.96-88.75: Lower vehicle production volumes due to ongoing chip shortage was the biggest contributor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 89.31-93.63: However, labor disruption due to the greater spread of the Omicron variant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 93.65-102.14: Widespread inflationary pressures, inventory destocking, broader supply chain issues, and logistical constraints also contributed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 103.16-109.71: But I want to emphasize that while the quarter was challenging and while our results were well below our recent performance,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 109.87-114.41: Nothing has changed fundamentally for EXCO or our medium-term outlook. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 115.26-119.16: We expect much stronger results in the quarters ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 119.58-127.69: In fact, with that in mind, I am very pleased to announce that yesterday our board of directors approved a 5% increase in our dividend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 127.71-130.77: To an annualized rate of 42 cents per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 131.53-137.34: This is the 14th time Exco has increased its dividend in the last 13 consecutive years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 138.00-143.06: I'm not sure how many other companies have done this, but I do know it's a pretty exclusive club. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.42-152.35: Despite current headwinds, we remain encouraged by the underlying trends across our various businesses that will contribute to our future growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 153.17-159.80: I've mentioned several times before the automotive industry's transformation towards electric vehicles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 159.82-165.69: And focus on reducing emissions is extremely positive for EXCO's tooling businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 166.71-172.59: As OEMs make the change to greener vehicles and strive for greater manufacturing efficiency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.81-177.54: There is an increased use of light metals in the demand for our associated tooling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 178.90-186.03: There is also increasing demand for technical expertise at the supplier level as products become larger and more complex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 186.89-188.13: More broadly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 188.15-197.86: We also expect to benefit from the trend towards larger and more complex castings across the industry, as all OEMs seem likely to pursue this playbook. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 198.74-203.24: In addition, there is a heightened focus on efficiency by all manufacturers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 203.26-208.97: For sustainability initiatives that will be very positive for the entirety of our tooling business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 210.19-218.80: In anticipation of these trends, we continue to make sizable investments in order to better position our various businesses to capture these opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.52-228.51: We are investing record sums of CAPEX this year across several initiatives and we made great headway on advancing these projects during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 229.85-237.62: By this point, I think the constrained supply of microchips impacting the OEM's ability to manufacture vehicles is well understood. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 238.38-244.99: Most industry players and analysts do, however, expect an improvement in supply as we go through 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 245.87-255.42: IHS, for example, is anticipating a 17% increase in vehicle volumes in 2022 and a further 11% in 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 256.22-260.10: It is important to understand that underlying demand for vehicles remains strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 260.62-271.11: This is evidenced by record high prices for used vehicles, significantly depleted dealer inventories, and an aging of the on-road vehicle fleet to historic levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 272.59-282.52: Turning to the quarter and first looking at our automotive solution segment, overall vehicle production volumes in North America and Europe were down about 20% year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 283.22-285.39: This drove our segment revenues lower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 285.57-294.33: But we were additionally impacted by unfavorable vehicle and product mix shift, inventory destocking of EXCO's products in the supply chain,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 294.35-297.84: As well as our own operational and logistical constraints. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 299.04-302.34: New program launches contributed to our results this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 302.36-309.35: Including one key new program where we are supplying sizable content on a fleet of commercial EV vans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.09-317.26: This program will begin to ramp up more significantly in our third fiscal quarter and continue for several years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 318.28-324.20: Moreover, we will continue to ramp up several other new key programs through 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.22-328.45: That will provide outsized growth relative to our historical performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 329.11-333.49: Meanwhile, quoting activity and new program awards remains very decent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 334.11-340.92: We are seeing a number of sizable new opportunities, particularly with electric vehicles from both new and established OEMs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 342.00-347.21: On the cost side, our margins suffered from greatly reduced overhead absorption due to the lower volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 347.91-350.77: Employee severance costs were also a factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 350.97-359.46: Although we also carried extra costs as we have retained surplus labor in anticipation that demand levels will rebound in the coming quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 360.42-366.05: Fluctuations in forecast versus actual order releases were again problematic this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 366.57-371.55: This occurred as our customers juggled their own production schedules in response to the chip shortage issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 372.31-377.80: These challenges were pushed down to the supply base and placed strain on our own production planning process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 378.52-384.78: Moreover, raw material cost increase has picked up and we've faced various supply chain challenges of our own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 385.89-393.91: These elements required us to be nimble and also absorb a lot of extra costs related to overtime, material substitution, and expedited freight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 394.85-400.24: Pricing remains tough in this business and there is limited ability to use this tool as a lever. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.94-408.77: We did, however, take pricing action where possible to recover higher input costs. We will see the impact of these actions in our second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 410.67-417.48: In our casting and extrusion segment, our top line held up fairly well. In fact, we recorded modest growth over the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 418.24-423.26: The extrusion market remains strong this quarter with high demand across a number of end markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 423.92-431.43: Our extrusion tooling ultimately supports a diverse range of applications including residential and industrial building and construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.45-435.88: Solar panels, consumer durable products, and various modes of transportation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.66-441.16: This quarter, we again demonstrated we could keep up with the sizable demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 441.18-449.29: Growth by utilizing equipment and labor more efficiently while leveraging the harmonized manufacturing process of our numerous group facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 450.19-459.98: With regards to the latter, this initiative has allowed us to centralize certain processes such as programming and design and utilize our capacity on a network basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 460.60-468.27: All of this keeps our cost low, capacity high, and provides us with the ability to manufacture a quality product in a standardized manner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 469.21-478.34: We are making significant strategic investments to further shrink lead times, drive down our operating costs, and insource more of our own heat treat requirements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 478.36-480.76: All while reducing our environmental footprint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 482.28-492.47: The die-cast market, which is driven by automotive production, however, softened materially in the quarter as lower vehicle production was magnified by inventory destocking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 493.43-501.56: This negatively impacted demand for CASTools consumable die cast tooling while the large mold group suffered from reduced rebuild work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.26-507.39: Nonetheless, we achieved a number of program wins that will benefit future quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 507.81-515.68: In fact, we achieved record levels of order intake in our large mold group, ending the quarter with the highest backlog in our history. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.68-519.88: We are very bullish on the long-term outlook of this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 519.92-531.85: Given the growing demand for large and complex die-cast components coupled with our leading market position, full service capabilities, and view that supply change will become more localized over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 532.93-541.66: As well, our additive tooling business continues to perform very strongly, contributing record levels of sales and order intake during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 542.54-551.15: Additive tooling is a critical differentiator providing us with an unmatched competitive edge. We are extremely optimistic on where this business will go. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 552.43-559.42: Looking at the casting and extrusion segment margins, we experienced weakness this quarter from levels that we have otherwise come to expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.08-563.54: Segment margins were impacted by unfavorable product mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 563.56-571.63: Rising input costs, higher freight charges, and labor disruption due to COVID, all of which outpace ongoing efficiency gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.53-582.72: As well, front-end losses at Castool's new plant in Morocco added to the margin pressure this quarter, as revenue was only started to be generated towards the end of the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 584.08-591.11: We did take pricing action where possible through the quarter to protect our margins and expect the impact will be evident in our next quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 592.21-599.84: Lastly, as we announced during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire Halix, Europe's second largest manufacturer of extrusion dies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.66-610.07: There's not really much more of an update at this time. We continue to work towards closing the acquisition this spring and welcoming Halex employees to Exco at that time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 610.95-619.94: That concludes my operations overview. I will now pass the call to Matthew to discuss the financial highlights of the quarter. Matthew? Thank you, Darren. Good morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 620.76-627.47: Consolidated sales for the first quarter into December 31st were $101 million, a decrease of $20.4 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 628.19-633.17: Over the quarter, the consolidated impact of exchange rate movements reduced sales by $3.5 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 634.03-641.10: Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter sales at our automotive solution segment decreased $18.6 million or 24%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 641.12-645.09: And the casting and extrusion group sales were up 1.6 million or 4%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.37-655.94: Consolidated net income for the first quarter was $2.7 million or earnings of $0.07 per share compared to $10.9 million or $0.28 per share in the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 656.38-658.28: A 75% decrease in net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 659.12-664.78: The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was 26% compared to 22% in the prior year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 665.33-670.77: The income tax rate in the current year quarter was impacted by geographic distribution and foreign rate differentials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 672.39-680.72: The automotive solution segment experienced a 27% decrease in sales in the first quarter or a decrease of $20.9 million to $55.2 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 681.42-683.22: The decrease in sales is attributed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 683.24-686.97: To lower OEM production volumes due to COVID-19 constraints. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 687.01-689.45: Related supply chain disruptions, storage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.47-697.62: Including a shortage of semiconductor chips, unfavorable vehicle production mix, logistics challenges, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 698.64-708.25: First quarter pre-tax earnings in the automotive solutions segment totaled $3.4 million, which is a decrease of $8.2 million, or 71% over the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.95-717.64: The segment's lower pre-tax profit is due to the 24% reduction in sales causing lower overhead absorption and higher material, logistics, and labor costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 719.04-728.87: The cashing and extrusion segment recorded sales of $45.8 million in the first quarter compared to $45.3 million last year, an increase of half a million dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 729.35-735.42: The extrusion group experienced strong sales at locations reflecting steady demand for extrusion tools and market share gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 736.02-738.16: The cast tool enlarge mold groups. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 738.18-746.19: Sales were down during the quarter due to the same supply chain disruptions caused by the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting automotive vehicle production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 746.65-750.73: Lowering demand for consumable tooling for die casting and rebuild work for mold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 751.43-759.36: The large mold group quoted and was awarded a number of programs from current and new customers in the quarter. As a result, inventories and backlog are increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 761.16-769.03: Pre-tax earnings in the casting and extrusion segment declined by $2.6 million or 7% over the same quarter last year to $4.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 769.75-777.56: The impact of inflationary pressure on raw materials and transportation combined with lower overhead absorption at calf stool and large mold reduced pre-tax profits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.92-788.79: Exco generated cash from operating activities of $8 million during the quarter and $5.2 million of free cash flow after $2.8 million in maintenance fixed asset expenditures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 789.23-792.73: This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was more than sufficient to fund. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 792.75-799.34: Fixed assets for growth initiatives of $8.2 million and a $3.9 million of dividends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 800.06-808.95: XCO entered the quarter with $11.6 million in net cash and $35.3 million in available liquidity, including $26.3 million of balance sheet cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 809.71-811.91: Xco's financial position remains very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.31-819.18: As such, the company's balance sheet and availability under the existing credit facility allows considerable flexibility to support strategic initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 819.22-822.64: Like our HALUX extrusion purchase announced in December 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.42-833.01: Our strong financial position combined with our free cash flow creates a foundation for management to pursue high value growth capital expenditures, dividends and other opportunities that may arise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.75-837.74: That concludes my comments. We can now transition to the Q&A portion of the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.00-848.99: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star then one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 849.69-854.49: Again, that's star one to ask the question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.44-867.51: Our first question comes from the line of David Ocampo with Cormac Securities. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 869.09-875.06: What percentage of the contracts that you guys have in place were you able to reprice. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 875.60-882.48: And then just thinking about a more higher level, when you combine that with sort of that operational efficiency that you guys are looking for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.98-891.77: Are you guys able to offset that inflationary pressure and hit your 15% target or are we thinking more longer term where we need to see some of these contracts roll off? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 893.63-897.84: So I presume you're talking about the automotive solutions segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 898.68-900.00: Yeah, that's right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 900.10-907.71: A lot of that business is fixed price work that continues for a number of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 907.83-914.89: You know, you kind of are exposed to rising raw material costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 915.08-916.10: And... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.24-928.37: You know, our path back to kind of a 15% segment EBITDA margin certainly remains very achievable in our minds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.57-936.70: That path includes kind of first getting back to normalized sales levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 937.06-944.32: And then having the benefit of the new program launches for over absorption of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.34-950.47: Of overhead that we plan through the next at least couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.43-960.44: And there are pockets of products within the segment where we do have some pricing power. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 960.90-964.82: And we're certainly, and we have pursued that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 965.91-972.33: So, you know, it's probably the minority of products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 972.69-977.70: And the rest you have to offset with efficiency gains, which we continue to do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 978.44-990.81: There are other aspects such as LTAs or long-term pricing adjustments where you have an obligation to reduce prices through the program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 990.95-998.86: But with pushback, we expect that we'll be successful in not taking those reductions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 999.36-1005.63: So, that's kind of at a high level how we think about the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1005.65-1009.69: The impact of rising raising costs in that segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1011.51-1020.64: A lot of the discussion over the last few quarters has been on your large multivision and the impact on sales from the shift to EV. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.34-1024.78: But one area that we haven't really touched on is the margin profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1025.19-1031.61: So are the molds for EV in your view, you know, similar to transmissions and engine blocks or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1031.63-1035.66: Could they even be higher than where your legacy business is today? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.36-1039.62: Yeah, I wouldn't say that they're... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1039.64-1049.65: Is a reason to expect a dissimilar margin for EV molds as opposed to powertrain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.77-1056.12: I mean, but just generally as molds get larger and more complex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.48-1063.66: It reduces the number of players that can effectively compete in the space. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1063.98-1069.03: And requires much more sophisticated engineering and technical depth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1069.59-1079.52: You would expect that that would be accompanied with higher value add over time, but we're certainly not modeling that in, but I think that the logic holds together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.48-1082.96: I mean, I think that's what I'm looking for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.34-1093.07: What kind of ramp can we expect at the new Castile facility? Is it something similar to what we've seen at the other greenfield facilities where it takes a couple of quarters to get up to profitability? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1094.25-1098.14: That's right. I mean, there's certainly a few. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.16-1100.52: Quarters of uh... Of drag. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1100.54-1109.91: In the profitability, but by the end of the fiscal year, we would certainly expect that facility to be at least deep a down break even. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1110.45-1112.93: If not better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1112.97-1127.61: Five-year target that we have disclosed of realizing at least 30 million of revenue between Castile's plant in Morocco and then their planned new plant in Mexico. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1127.63-1130.93: By the end of that time frame, certainly holds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.95-1132.25: It certainly holds true. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1134.69-1140.26: That's it for me. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks, guys. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.56-1146.77: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Schuyler with BMO Capital Markets. The line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1147.63-1149.41: Good morning, Darren, Matthew. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1151.03-1159.58: My first question is, like you've done a really good job explaining how the earnings deteriorated year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1160.10-1161.42: But I... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1161.84-1168.51: We'd just like to have a little bit of discussion versus quarter over quarter versus the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1168.55-1172.77: If you look at vehicle production volumes,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1173.09-1180.00: They were stronger, global vehicle production volumes, North American vehicle production volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1180.30-1190.79: Were stronger in Q1 than they were in Q4, but the earnings of the company in both segments really deteriorated significantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.81-1192.15: The fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1192.25-1203.86: I'm just trying to figure out what has changed since the fourth quarter because arguably the backdrop was pretty bad and was even worse in the fourth quarter, at least in terms of vehicle production volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.58-1207.57: Yeah, it's a good question, Peter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1207.69-1216.28: I would explain that we were more so impacted by inventory destocking in our first quarter than the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.86-1226.01: And that concept has really come to a head during our latest quarter. And just to kind of explain that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1226.15-1230.15: If you're running, call it thick die cast machines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1230.89-1237.26: You might have 12 molds, six in production, and six backup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1237.78-1243.42: And as volumes go down, then here's the,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.44-1251.35: You first deplete your backup dies rather than adding new dies for rebuild. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1251.83-1255.10: And we really saw the impact of that this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.40-1259.32: In fact, we only shipped one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.34-1266.49: One rebuilt die in the quarter, which is highly, highly unusual for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1267.41-1272.67: So I guess the converse of that is on the way up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.33-1276.06: Not only do you get the benefits of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1276.08-1283.38: Higher vehicle production, but then you get the inventory replenishment that needs to occur. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1283.64-1293.21: And with our strong order flow that we saw in the quarter rising to record backlog in the large mold group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1293.75-1298.14: We certainly think and expect that we're at the front end of that rebound. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.20-1306.47: Similar dynamics would apply to CAS tools, die-cast consumable tooling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.49-1315.62: Components, which did see a more sizable dip this quarter than what we saw in prior sequential quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.90-1317.72: Right, okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.80-1323.06: And can you talk a little bit about plant labor? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.76-1330.27: So have you had trouble getting labor in the plant and has that disrupted your operations? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1332.19-1341.46: Yeah, for sure. I think that phenomenon is pretty widespread across all entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.46-1360.14: And it has been exacerbated by the Omicron variant in the last quarter where, you know, there were some weeks where 20% of the labor or more was out due to that factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1360.16-1366.25: And so it's a continuing challenge to just find people. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1366.59-1377.08: And then that is compounded by just the disruption that's occurred due to COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.30-1380.90: And we continue to work against that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1381.36-1389.77: It forces you to think about how you produce things and ultimately you need to become more efficient. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1389.99-1397.52: And I think that one of the benefits that we've had over the years is we've added a lot more equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1397.80-1401.86: And we really haven't increased our head count. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1402.96-1407.79: And so we have become more efficient and will continue to do so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1409.17-1412.11: And Darren, just back on this quarter over quarter theme, right? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.33-1421.12: I understand you gave a good explanation why the tooling businesses did worse but also auto solutions did worse versus the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.88-1426.55: And vehicle production volumes were higher in the first quarter than the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1427.09-1428.41: What happened there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.71-1436.30: So that is similar, inventory, the stocking I think was... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.32-1443.54: Was a big factor in that. And then labor disruption as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.58-1461.58: And there has been some elevated raw material and input cost inflation that we are, have taken some measures to reverse. And as we've indicated in our comments and in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1461.60-1467.23: In the news release that we expect to see the benefit of that in our second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1468.21-1480.40: Yeah, and Peter, another component that we look at is mix between different locations, and we don't get into that level of detail in these calls, but we've had different mix of, you know, production might have been up,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.62-1488.29: In certain areas, but depending on how it fit our mix in our production in our locations, that also caused some challenges there too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.37-1500.28: Okay, and then just my last question is in the write-up you talked about the additive manufacturing business. I don't think I've heard that wording before. What is that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1501.44-1505.83: That's our 3D printed tooling components. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.91-1511.77: And we'd love to have you up to our new market plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1511.91-1518.16: But that's been a very strong growth business and differentiator for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.96-1528.75: What we're talking about there is making parts of the mold components by printing them with steel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1528.89-1533.55: So we basically print a steel component. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.69-1543.26: And that enables us to have water lines and cooling lines that follow the contour of the mold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.52-1547.99: And so we can target hot spots in the mold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1548.01-1556.54: Much better using 3D printed components than making those components traditionally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1557.20-1564.14: And that has an overall very positive impact on the cycle time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.16-1570.87: And other measures such as scrap rates of the casting process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1571.43-1575.03: And we are leaders in this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1575.38-1576.42: Couple of years ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1577.44-1578.96: We won the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1578.98-1585.81: Automotive News Pace Award in recognition of our leadership of this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1585.85-1592.29: And we're seeing greater and greater traction from many customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1592.91-1599.20: And so we use these additively produced components in our own molds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.72-1608.35: And we also sell some of them as kind of replacement components for mold rebuild. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1609.19-1619.08: It's a very exciting part of the large mole group and we expect it will have very strong growth over the coming years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.00-1626.85: I understand. Is it like a prototype tooling or is it a prototype part? It's a production tooling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1627.25-1631.41: They're used in the molds and in more and more of our molds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.53-1641.06: In fact, most of them now have 3D printed mold components in them that serves to improve the efficiency of the overall mold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1643.58-1645.17: Okay, thanks. That's all I have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1649.95-1653.07: Reminder ladies and gentlemen that's star one to ask the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1662.84-1663.94: For the questions in the Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1665.13-1666.77: I would now like to turn the call back over to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.03-1676.16: Well, thanks everyone for your time this morning. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Take care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.30-1682.32: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. 
asr:0: END
