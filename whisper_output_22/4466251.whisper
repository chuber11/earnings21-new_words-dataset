asr:0: OUTPUT 760.16-766.85: Believe we can give more precise guidance on the impact of this business to our consolidated results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.55-771.45: I will now leave the floor to Andrew to go over the financial results and replace... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 772.29-779.54: Thank you, Burak. After excellent first half, we continued delivering strong financial results in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.74-786.13: Despite Turkish lira depreciation, all inflationary challenges and high base of the third quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 787.19-795.46: Our net sales revenue grew by 37% in the quarter, driven by the sales volume momentum, especially in Turkey and Central Asia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.88-802.36: Improved package and channel mix, timely price adjustments, and other revenue growth management initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.38-812.95: There was a 233 basis points contraction in gross profit margin due to the surge in commodity prices and depreciation of Turkish Lira. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 814.17-822.18: Contractions remained limited thanks to our hedging initiatives, proactive procurement management, and price adjustment we made during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.42-834.29: When we look at the country detail, contraction comes mainly from Turkey, while there has been a 165 basis points improvement in the gross margin of international operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 835.36-841.22: Higher Turkish Lira devaluation against more stable international currencies is one of the main reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 842.14-848.99: As we guided previously, our direct marketing expenses increased in line with the normalization and higher mobility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 849.85-857.48: Ovex to sales ratio realized at around 16% up by 104 basis points against a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.96-864.66: EBITDA grew by 17% and we delivered 24.1% EBITDA margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.55-872.05: 415 basis point decline in the EBITDA margin is mainly due to exceptionally high base of the last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 873.23-881.46: As I mentioned, gross profit margin contraction in Turkey also made an impact due to significant depreciation of Turkish Lira and high commodity prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.60-887.89: We delivered a strong 916 million Turkish Lira quarterly net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 888.67-896.86: Strong operational performance and prudent financial expense management made the highest contributions to the net income growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 897.96-905.61: I also must mention that during the quarter we recorded a sizable provision for slow moving and lower per unit value spare parts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 905.63-909.01: Amounting to 205 million Turkish Lira. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 909.77-916.34: This was partly mitigated by the 140 million Turkish lira income from the land sale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.36-922.82: Yet, on a net basis, it had a non-cash negative impact on the consolidated net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.98-933.15: Next slide, please. Our FX neutral net sales revenue per unit case growth was on track in the short quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 933.81-942.04: It increased by 14% on the back of dynamic pricing, better discount management, and other revenue growth management initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 942.16-946.17: Including prioritization of certain SKUs and IC multipacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 947.19-953.99: However, due to the significant surge in commodity prices, COGS per unit case grew by 18%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.01-957.94: More than upsetting the positive contribution from the strong top line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.06-962.86: We continue to invest in marketing as our business is back to a new normal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.62-971.23: As guided before, we stepped up our marketing expenses from 2% last year to over 4% this year in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 971.85-977.58: This gradual normalization in op-eds combined with higher core pressure led by... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.60-983.34: To a 5% contraction in FX neutral EBITDA per unit case in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 983.94-990.13: Our proactive hedging initiatives and frugal opex mindset help us to keep reduction to a limited level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.45-1001.62: However, looking on a nine-month cumulative basis, the profitable growth momentum continued, strengthening our confidence to deliver in line with our revised guidance for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1003.00-1004.06: To the next place, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1006.59-1013.15: Let me give you more color now on consolidated EBITDA and free cash flow evolution for the first nine months of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1014.37-1016.00: In terms of top line growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1016.22-1018.92: We performed ahead of our expectations year to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1019.18-1030.03: The easing of pandemic-related restrictions and reopening of on-premise channels contributed to this robust performance, while the positive momentum at the at-home channel continued. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1031.19-1039.20: Top line growth with improving channel package mix and timely price adjustments were the main contributors to EBITDA growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1040.42-1048.71: However, globally elevated demand and the supply chain bottlenecks led to a significant surge in the commodity prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1048.73-1052.43: Which pressured margins through COGS, especially in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.45-1059.12: On the OPEX side, we continued our tight OPEX management with the learnings from the pandemic period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1059.82-1068.09: But in line with the normalization and as we guided before, our direct marketing expenses increased to their pre-pandemic level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1069.49-1078.60: We delivered 43% EBITDA growth in nine months of 2021, with less than half a percentage point of margin contraction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1079.56-1084.12: On the other hand, our net working capital over annualized sales turned negative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1084.96-1092.53: Although CAPEX doubled in nominal terms, it only increased by one percentage point as a percentage of the net sales revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1093.37-1097.18: Bearing in mind that last year we cut COPEX to an absolute minimum. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1097.20-1104.54: This limited increase in copies is the result of our disciplined spending and is a strong contributor to 30% free cash flow growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.71-1106.81: On to the next slide, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1111.39-1122.70: Our net leverage continued to decrease to the lowest level ever of 0.4 times due to strong free cash flow generation and our prudent effects risk management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1123.50-1129.45: We finance the Uzbekistan acquisition with our own cash, relying on our strong balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.57-1139.56: Even after $252 million payment for the acquisition, our net debt to EBITDA ratio remained at historical low levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1139.64-1141.76: Thanks to our continued cash generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.64-1147.43: We do not expect a significant change in our leverage for the rest of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1148.31-1152.35: We remain comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1153.93-1160.52: Use of cash to finance the Uzbekistan acquisition increased our short currency position compared to the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1161.30-1168.91: We have short position of $350 million after deducting the existing hard currency cash balances and financial hedges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1169.63-1176.22: This is approximately to one time of our international Eid al-Adha, which we are comfortable to carry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.12-1182.16: As you know, on top of financial hedges, we have a net investment hedge as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.10-1192.71: Since Uzbekistan's acquisition is made by our Dutch subsidiary, and in order to finance this, we made a cash capital increase in the Dutch subsidiary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1193.19-1199.02: We were able to increase the net investment hedge amount by $150 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1200.00-1206.43: If we include net investment hedge as well, then CCI maintains net loan currency position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.45-1211.01: Hansen cure affects gain when Turkish lira depreciates against dollar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.75-1221.90: Considering the recent currency fluctuations, we keep our financial management discipline to mitigate the negative effects of currency depreciation on our balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.46-1226.15: We may consider further hedging alternatives depending on the market conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1227.31-1234.49: We are committed to maintain the balance between sustainable short position and strong free cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1235.80-1237.50: On to the next slide, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1241.26-1246.25: From a cost point of view, the world is certainly going through a very challenging time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1246.89-1254.99: The rapid price increases in global commodity markets are coupled with reports of raw material shortages and procurement delays around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.76-1261.66: In this environment, our number one priority is to ensure continuity of raw material supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1262.56-1268.59: Our procurement team has been quite proactive in terms of identifying potential incoming issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.83-1276.88: Engaging with alternative suppliers, preparing back-up plans, and even implementing in-house solutions for certain items such as CO2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.94-1287.25: Therefore, we do not expect to run into any procurement problems in the foreseeable future. However, we are not immune to the commodity inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.71-1296.60: This is another factor we are managing correctly. We have been successful with hedges that were put in place in 2021 during the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.58-1301.64: They help mitigating the impact of current input cost inflation substantially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1302.52-1306.25: However, these hedges begin to roll off by 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.97-1310.79: We kept adding new hedges over the course of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1311.59-1319.78: Although at higher levels than during pandemic, the new hedges still provide some mitigations against current spot prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.80-1323.02: And help with input cost visibility for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.70-1329.57: For 2022, we have already hedged 80% of our elusive needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.55-1338.78: However, unless we see a good correction in aluminum prices, we do not expect to increase hedge coverage substantially beyond current level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1338.80-1342.20: And leave some exposure to the sport procurement in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1343.06-1349.07: Aluminum is not a substantial part of our cost base and we are questioning the sustainability of current prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1350.75-1356.10: We also hedged 42% of raising requirements and looking for opportunities to add coverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.58-1365.97: Sugar is a regulated commodity in many of our markets. Therefore, our coverage is limited since hedging is not available or practical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1366.87-1369.77: We continue monitoring the commodity price environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1370.61-1374.37: Apart from hedging, we are taking proactive price increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.39-1383.78: Implementing further RGM initiatives, and accelerating productivity measures to offset some of the commodity cost pressure as we look forward to the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1386.07-1392.03: I now hand over to Burak for his closing remarks. Burak, please. Well, thanks, Andrei. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1393.15-1398.36: Given strong results year to date and increased visibility into the rest of the year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.88-1403.70: We are revising our organic guidance on sales volume and revenue terms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.42-1412.15: Our existing hedges protect us to a great extent and the larger scale also supports our profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.69-1421.38: As a result, we are committed to keep our EBTA margin flat on an organic basis despite the challenging commodity cost environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.92-1425.99: As you know, since the beginning of last quarter of 2021,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.79-1430.61: We have started consolidating Uzbekistan operation into our financials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.75-1439.80: The fourth quarter impact will not be significant. Therefore, you will see only a couple of percentage points of incremental growth from this operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1439.98-1442.00: On the Volume and Revenue side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.58-1448.45: As discussed before, you will see a slight dilution on the EBT margin level, not immaterial. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1449.35-1458.00: Looking ahead, an inflationary environment, supply chain bottlenecks and currency volatility will be the main headwinds for our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1458.54-1463.28: We continue to be agile, careful in dealing with these short-term challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1463.64-1473.45: However, we are leveraging the learnings from the COVID period, applying revenue growth management initiatives, working on supply chain levers and expanding digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.47-1478.34: Enablement of execution to capitalize on the strengths of our brands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1479.04-1482.86: We have years of experience succeeding in the volatile environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1483.02-1489.25: However, we will not deviate from our long-term roadmap of creating value for our stakeholders that we serve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.41-1496.42: We look at the future with the confidence counting on our commitment, talented people. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1496.44-1503.40: Excellent brand portfolio, digital capabilities, strong system alignment and underlying potential of our markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1504.32-1508.37: We are now ready to take your questions and operator please. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1510.75-1517.94: Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. If you wish to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.98-1521.42: Thank you for holding until we have our first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1532.81-1539.98: Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, in order to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1541.72-1547.09: The first question comes from Hans-Heide Kielis-Bieran from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1548.37-1558.24: Thank you for the presentation. I have a question for Andrew, actually. Andrew, you mentioned about the hedging in major cost items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1559.24-1563.94: So according to our current hedging level at the hedged crisis,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.44-1569.55: How much headwind, margin headwind are you looking for next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.78-1579.62: Thank you for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1582.04-1587.07: In terms of the margin, I guess I understand you're looking for the guidance for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1588.41-1596.36: And I think we will be more comfortable to provide it when we actually finish this year and we're working on different scenarios. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1597.18-1599.44: Obviously, as before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.46-1625.31: We are focused on optimizing the business and mitigating the impact of commodity prices by other measures that we described. There are also – we're devising the plans for the remainder of this year and for next year to make sure that we minimize or mitigate the impact of commodity prices on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1625.33-1626.57: Um... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.59-1628.65: On our margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.53-1636.80: I understand that you would prefer to hear the guidance, but we're not ready to give the EBITDA guidance for margin for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1637.74-1648.91: Maybe not the guidance, but I'm trying, because you already know your cost rates now, because you are already hedged 80% on aluminum. Sugar prices are regulated mostly in line with the inflation and the resume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.93-1650.15: Is mostly hashed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1651.17-1656.18: So I'm trying to understand if you increase the prices in land with the country's inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.02-1666.15: I mean, the margin has been, should be clear, I think, right? I mean, how much price increase do you need to cover these hedge prices? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1666.29-1672.11: I mean, because I don't know your hedging price on the aluminum or other raw materials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1675.06-1678.34: Are your hedging prices are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.36-1685.89: Lower than the current crisis or compared to 20, I mean so far on the year-to-date average, how does it stand? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1687.57-1693.33: Yeah, why the haste to provide guidance? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1693.35-1698.58: Because our 2020 numbers, particularly third quarter numbers,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1699.26-1702.74: In terms of the commodity prices were extremely low. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.44-1707.87: This was probably the bottom of the pricing for a very, very long time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.03-1718.32: Right now, we sort of ran over hedges that we made during crisis, during COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1718.34-1720.46: Last year for this year by. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.48-1730.25: Sort of early Q3, and in Q3 we were on a more normalized procurement and added hedges this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1731.31-1739.94: Therefore, if anything, the Q3 is sort of a more sustainable situation than the previous year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1742.22-1749.57: And therefore, we are looking at how much price we already took and how much price we need to take to cover that impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1751.57-1756.14: Thank you very much, Andrew. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.36-1764.62: Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, in order to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1777.40-1781.96: We have a question from Samal Demirtaz from Atain. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1783.62-1787.57: Thank you for the presentation and congratulations for a very good result. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1788.29-1790.63: My questions have been to your guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.35-1793.75: I think you... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1793.77-1802.98: Just include the effect of CCDU. Could you give anything about excluding that to see the trend? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1803.08-1809.13: And as far as I understand, you are only going to record it for one part, right? It's not going to be... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.15-1815.16: Just backwards. You are going to just include the fourth quarter to your consolidation. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1817.66-1819.84: Yes, thank you for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1819.86-1821.92: We, yes, we include only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.00-1831.91: For me, for the fourth quarter, impact of CCBU, since it's the smallest quarter, you understand that impact overall is fairly small. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1832.41-1840.84: Particularly that CCBU has only 7% volume impact on overall CCI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.16-1846.55: So yes, it's a fairly small impact on overall guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.01-1858.28: Thank you. And as a follow-up, when I look at your numbers, I see that steel side is performing better recently compared to sparking side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1858.62-1867.55: Do we see any fundamental change in trends or is it just cyclical? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.57-1868.87: Nature of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.79-1872.85: Good question, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1874.21-1883.24: We, I think we talk about it fairly often on our investor calls and presentations to investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.28-1889.33: If we look at this cycle, economic cycle and sort of crisis in the past,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.41-1897.28: Sparking usually goes to decline last. It declines less. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1897.42-1901.80: And then it comes out of the crisis earliest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.74-1906.85: And this is exactly what happened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1907.97-1914.15: So this was sort of sparkling performed relatively better, significantly better than steel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.51-1924.04: Now, when we get to sort of economic improvement, overall climate, consumer confidence increasing,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.21-1934.53: Newer categories, they tend to grow relatively faster, so that's nothing unusual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1935.14-1943.62: So we expected that. Obviously, we are very focused on continuing to develop the full portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.28-1948.89: Without forgetting, continue to grow Sparkling as a core of our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1949.95-1958.12: But we don't see any unusual trend in this. It's a normal dynamic of cyclical performance in our industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1960.82-1965.75: Thank you. And one last question about your effective take straight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1966.25-1969.69: We see some decline in third quarter versus second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1970.19-1978.76: Part of it could be related to changes in corporate tax in Turkey. That was why the second quarter was high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1979.88-1988.73: What do you see for the following quarters, just the average thing, considering your combined results, consolidated results? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1991.55-1999.48: No, there should not be any significant deviation going forward in terms of the tax rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2007.53-2014.57: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, in order to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.96-2019.58: The next question comes from Charlie Hicks from Redburn. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.06-2022.64: Hi there, thanks for the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2022.90-2025.99: The first one is on Monster Energy where you doubled volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2026.39-2034.21: Can you maybe give a bit more colour on what's going on there? Is that underlying consumer demand? Is that if a check? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2034.23-2040.00: You know, changing that execution or a combination of both from line extensions perhaps just. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2040.14-2042.22: Maybe a bit more color on that strong performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2042.78-2048.41: And then the second question is on Pakistan, where you said you've changed your route to market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2048.95-2058.12: I was just wondering if you had a bit more color there and your thoughts going into Q4 where you've got a pretty tough volume comp on Q4 20. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.60-2063.48: Thank you for the question. So first is energy and then Pakistan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2064.00-2065.19: On energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.17-2075.90: I think it's all the factors that you mentioned. One, the consumer demand is there and very evident. It's a high growth category overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2076.70-2081.92: We said it multiple times, we are committed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2081.94-2089.39: To grow in this category. This is one of our strategic categories and we will continue to improve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.93-2095.38: And so that's why we are actively driving the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2095.98-2102.78: We continue to improve and streamline our relationship with the monster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2102.80-2110.43: And working with their strong portfolio and winning portfolio from our perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2111.21-2114.13: So, yes, there were some... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2114.15-2124.26: Line extensions and other actions, but nothing unusual. Just focused and very good execution by us and Monster together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.79-2138.26: Now Pakistan, in terms of Pakistan and route to market, we have been talking about route to market in Pakistan for the last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2138.28-2139.86: Two and a half, three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2140.32-2147.69: And this was a very deliberate change that we started two and a half years ago or so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2148.21-2153.93: And now it's given the results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2154.47-2164.38: That we wanted, that we planned, that we expected from that change. So what we have been doing in Pakistan over the last two and a half years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2164.40-2167.55: Is simplifying and streamlining. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2167.57-2173.99: How our product gets from our factory to the hands of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2174.01-2176.88: Outlet and finally to the consumer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2177.52-2180.00: And there wasn't fairly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2181.44-2188.97: Archaic and multi-layered system of how product was moving from multiple participants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2189.01-2195.56: And this was a standard for the industry, for FMCG more broadly in Pakistan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2196.60-2208.41: We decided to change it to what we are more accustomed to, much more efficient and effective system where participants are in that value chain only if they truly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2208.43-2217.26: Clearly contribute to the advancement of our business and our product and adding value to the chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2217.70-2220.42: And therefore that simplification. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.42-2230.75: In addition to just normal route-to-market expansion, sort of horizontal expansion, adding more outlets, reaching new areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.81-2232.73: Moving on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2232.91-2239.24: Cooler placement and in-store execution is given the results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.42-2246.23: But again, this is not something new. This is a very deliberate plan for the last two and a half years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.55-2257.96: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2265.27-2269.69: We have a question from Yurtkan from Wooden Company. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2271.31-2275.84: Dr. Thank you very much for the presentation and congratulations on the set of numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2276.26-2281.58: My question is related to the Uzbekistan operations which we have recently acquired. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2282.92-2288.17: Could you please elaborate on the areas in which you see room for improvement and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2289.07-2296.10: What are your medium-term targets on the operating lines of Uzbekistan Operation? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2296.16-2303.14: I'm referring more to the EVTM margin guidance for the vaccine operation. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2307.65-2319.02: In terms of Uzbekistan and what are the areas of improvement, as Brad said, that we are very excited that CCBU became part of CCI family. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2320.48-2331.89: It's a well-established operation when it comes to manufacturing and basic policies and procedures of the Coca-Cola system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2333.55-2343.52: However, the biggest opportunity we see in Uzbekistan is sort of commercial area and in-market execution and commercial capabilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2344.92-2350.39: And this is where we believe we bring strengths, particularly in emerging and frontier markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2350.93-2356.92: And this is a very significant part of our focus, how to create value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2356.96-2365.03: And accelerate value creation in Uzbekistan, particularly that the market continues to demonstrate tremendous growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.77-2375.01: Naturally, with our execution capabilities, that we'll be able to step change of what CCBU has been doing so far, we believe we can add a lot of value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.40-2376.60: Second,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2376.70-2381.02: The business was sort of optimized and... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2381.04-2391.11: Run on a very limited capacity and essentially they have been selling until now what they can produce from the factory floor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2392.85-2396.26: There is a tremendous unaddressed demand in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2396.78-2399.14: And therefore adding capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.16-2408.75: While improving in market execution could provide very significant growth potential for a foreseeable future in Uzbekistan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2409.19-2411.05: In terms of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2411.07-2420.02: In terms of the guidance for the next year on Uzbekistan, again, I'm afraid I will disappoint you, as Bragvei said, that by. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2421.16-2430.23: Probably by end of the year when we have a next call for the next order, we'll give a clear guidance on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2430.25-2433.01: How Uzbekistan will be performing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.07-2442.06: At this time, we just would like to share with you the nine months actual results and the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2442.84-2451.87: That's pretty much what we have as we took control of the operation since basically the last day of the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2454.47-2463.10: Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Hansade Kilikiran from Jogan. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2464.94-2468.69: Thank you, Andrew. I have a follow-up question on pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2469.23-2478.76: Just start increasing prices in Turkey and how much price increases were done in the third quarter including Turkey and also the markets. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2481.46-2490.65: Yeah, we have been taking prices regularly in all our markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2491.03-2498.60: And this year was no exception as we have been communicating for the last few years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2499.12-2506.49: Regularly that we are committed to monetize value of brands we operate better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.51-2509.77: In every market we are present. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2511.07-2519.32: And we stick to that strategy. In terms of increases in Turkey,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2519.40-2528.75: In this in the third quarter we made approximately 10 percent price increases on average in Turkey specifically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2529.37-2533.57: Right? And so we, that's just in this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2533.97-2542.50: And we will continue to look for opportunities to sort of continue on our strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2542.70-2548.51: Of realizing is on a sort of better value and better pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.87-2553.89: For example, as you may recall in the first half of the year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.49-2560.96: We already grew increase average price in Turkey by about 17%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2564.74-2574.17: Thank you. Is there any other significant price increases in other markets that you may flag? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2575.78-2583.22: Yeah, I think we, as I said, we took pretty much price increases pretty much in all markets we operate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2583.26-2589.07: And therefore I think you can see the...
