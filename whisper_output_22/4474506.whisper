asr:0: OUTPUT 318.92-323.08: And excluding gas inflation, lower year over year by six basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.64-334.13: As you normally do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers. There are two columns, both reported year over year in Q1, and then without gas inflation year over year in Q1.

asr:0: OUTPUT 337.12-345.17: Minus 63 basis points year over year on a reported basis, and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 345.89-352.25: Ancillary and other businesses, plus two on a reported basis, and plus 12x gas inflation.

asr:0: OUTPUT 378.90-385.97: Recall last year in Q1, the core reported was up 83 basis points and X gas up 66 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 386.39-390.05: So we've retained a good portion of the improvement from two years ago in the core. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 391.19-398.70: In terms of the core margin on their own sales in the first quarter, our core on core margins were lower by 18 basis points.

asr:0: OUTPUT 404.14-409.23: Also, lower year-over-year fresh foods was the primary driver of the corn being lower in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 409.71-415.20: Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 415.22-420.14: That occurred from the outsized sales that happened a year ago in the quarter.

asr:0: OUTPUT 448.79-454.55: A reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 455.26-457.26: And other was up 12 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 457.82-460.38: This is related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 461.18-467.87: That portion of the COVID related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our meat and bakery departments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.67-475.34: Given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 475.86-479.18: Our Q1 gross margins results, all in all, I think we're pretty good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 480.32-488.13: Moving to SG&A, I reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year over year by 66 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 488.19-492.19: And 29 basis points excluding gas inflation.

asr:0: OUTPUT 510.01-516.30: Central reported better by 10, without inflation, I guess inflation better by 6. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.70-521.26: Stock compensation better by two and worse by one in the two columns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 521.60-525.04: And other better by 14 and better by 13 year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 525.55-535.48: Total then, again on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and X gas inflation lower or better by 29 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 537.74-540.96: The keep in mind in terms of the core again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.98-549.35: Better by 40 or better by 11x gas inflation. Keep in mind this result includes the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 549.91-554.91: And four weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past october. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 554.93-562.68: Going from $16 to $17 and from $16.50 to $18 for our two main categories of hourly employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 563.24-572.55: These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25th, just six weeks ago, and four weeks of those six weeks were included in Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.53-580.02: Central, no surprises there, again on an ex-gas inflation basis, better by six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 580.30-584.82: Stock Comp, as I mentioned, a little worse by one, Ex-Gas Inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.31-588.21: And other, the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 588.81-593.69: This consisted of the COVID expense of $159 million last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.71-599.06: And the $118 million write-off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.04-608.91: Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. This year in the quarter, $28 million. Last year in the quarter, $22 or $6 million higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.71-613.55: All told, reporting an operating income in the first quarter increased 18%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 613.89-620.46: Coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 621.36-628.11: Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal 21 and 22. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 628.79-637.06: Interest income, interest expense rather, interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 13 million year over year, primarily due to favorable effects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 639.00-645.29: Overall reported pre-tax income in the first quarter was up 19%, coming in at $1.696 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 645.93-649.27: This year compared in the first quarter of last year of 1.42 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 650.15-658.54: In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of 22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 658.94-668.45: Again, both years tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier, $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 668.79-676.76: Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend that portion payable to the company's 401k plan participants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 677.50-685.07: The fiscal 22 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items, is currently projected to be between 26 and 27 percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.07-688.85: A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.29-696.68: As you know, for fiscal 21, we opened at 22 units, including two reloads, so a net increase of 20 units during fiscal 21. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 697.24-703.26: And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened nine units, including one relo. So net openings of eight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 703.74-712.05: For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units and also plan to open 23 units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.11-717.04: Four of which would be relocations, so a net of 19, if all goes as planned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.22-727.87: It's been a busy past seven days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4th, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 728.47-735.06: As well as two buildings opening this morning, opening today, one in the U.S. And Florida, and our fourth unit in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.86-741.72: Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal 22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 742.28-746.25: Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 746.73-752.73: This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 753.21-761.04: The largest areas of increase coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-com fulfillment operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 762.20-768.47: In terms of e-commerce, sales in the quarter, XFX, increased 13.3% year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 768.95-773.23: That's of course on top of an 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 773.87-778.94: Stronger apartments in terms of Euro percentages include jewelry, tires, and home furnishings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.40-786.41: Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 786.43-791.09: Was up in the high single digits, also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 792.39-797.38: In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 797.40-807.05: For the quarter, Costco logistics deliveries were up over 50 percent and now represent about 70 percent of our U.S. E-com big and bulky shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 807.89-811.95: We've averaged during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.45-821.84: And for the year, we project more than 3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old plants for logistics in the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.04-824.26: Our e-com mobile app. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 824.99-833.63: We continue to improve the site with additional features thus far as I've talked about in the last few quarters, quarterly calls. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 834.09-837.84: We redesigned the app header and footer. We've updated and improved the menu layout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 838.28-843.12: Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 843.68-849.81: Our Co-Brand City Visa card can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 850.55-858.56: Members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-comm deliveries in the US and Canada. Same goes for rescheduling returns, returns pickups. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 859.24-863.12: And delivering in the first half of the new upcoming new calendar year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.56-872.53: A better labeling of fulfillment methods, members will be able to easily see fulfillment options. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.99-879.56: Be it e-com, same day, and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item at a particular item level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 880.40-885.27: We're rolling out new e-comm kiosks in the warehouse with video signage and easy touchscreen ordering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.83-895.26: As well, we're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations, and we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 896.34-901.78: In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press just yesterday called Costco Next. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 902.50-910.87: In a way, it's like our warehouse roadshows, but online. Currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 911.25-915.12: Curated items with Costco values, so please check it out when you have a chance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.18-922.22: From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined 12 weeks ago on the last quarterly call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.80-928.85: Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit, but overall the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.39-931.97: Container challenges, COVID disruptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 932.27-939.86: Shortages of varied components, raw materials, ingredients, and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures, and truck and driver challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.44-948.59: Overall, we feel we've dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 949.05-953.93: About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.83-959.64: A few percentage of those are actually a few days early and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 960.32-966.05: Virtually all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases, as I mentioned, I think, earlier calls. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.49-972.23: Given the longer lead times, less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 972.77-976.70: Still some limitations on key items, but improving again at ebbs and flows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.30-986.81: Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season. An example might be lawn and garden and patio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 987.61-994.21: As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly, but it may extend into beyond the normal seasonal time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 995.06-1003.16: Toys and seasonal, in fact, same thing. Some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible and feel pretty good about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1006.13-1010.13: In terms of moving on to, despite all the supply chain issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1010.27-1017.80: Again, I feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1018.64-1023.86: Moving on to inflation, again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last two quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1024.28-1031.35: There have been in our variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing from labor costs to freight costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1031.37-1040.52: Higher demand to container shortages and port delays to increased demand on certain product categories. Much of what you see and read out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1040.96-1048.23: A very shortage is on everything from chips to oils and chemicals, full supply by facilities hit by the Gulf storms a while back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.25-1050.63: Higher commodities prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.11-1061.10: For Q1 2022, and talking with our merchants, senior merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1061.52-1069.49: That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago, but I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1070.33-1077.90: All of this said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1078.52-1081.62: Pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.66-1088.93: While keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1090.01-1097.06: I think overall this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.68-1105.02: Anecdotally on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong. Again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.85-1108.51: Baking items, more people seem to be getting together or strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.25-1117.82: Gift cards are up dramatically from a year ago, but it was a week a year ago. Pet products, as you might expect, are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1118.46-1127.99: Alcohol and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And of course, continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture, and mattresses and the like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1128.55-1134.81: Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year, albeit compared to relatively flat apparel sales a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.72-1142.92: One last comment, our sustainability commitment website received a major refresh this week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1144.20-1153.19: So please feel free to visit the site. It's linked directly from our homepage under the column about us and then click on sustainability commitment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1154.07-1163.48: Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 2nd on Wednesday, January 5th. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1164.04-1170.45: After market close. With that, I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.89-1177.00: And ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask questions, please press star and the number one on your telephone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1179.06-1183.98: For our first question, we have Michael Laser from UBS. Michael, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1185.67-1195.48: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, your point about the 4 to 5% inflationary increase across the assortment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1196.18-1205.69: Typically, Costco's been slower to raise prices than everyone else. That seems to be a number that's in line with others across the retail sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1205.97-1213.69: So, has the posture changed with respect to passing along price increases? Why is that the case? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.83-1221.92: And does Costco have more pricing power today than it ever has in the past, given the pricing gaps between you and others in the market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1223.26-1232.15: Well, I think as it relates to passing on, we've always said we want to be the last to raise the price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1232.17-1233.75: The first to lower the price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1234.23-1243.52: Recognizing there's a limit to what you can do based on these cost increases. First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with our vendors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.88-1248.83: We, with our suppliers, work to mitigate those increases in any way, shape, or form we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.77-1255.88: Ultimately, that may include us taking a little more, less markup and maybe them taking a little less markup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1256.24-1265.04: There's no complete consistent answer throughout, as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job of that. And there is inflation in those numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.69-1268.39: Those numbers are... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.41-1273.35: Kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our some price increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.57-1282.40: Again, it fluctuates. For every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flat or going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1282.96-1285.47: So again, it's a best guess, it's fluid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.15-1294.31: We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer and continuing into this fiscal year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1294.69-1299.92: And as we all have read articles, general articles out there about certain different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1299.94-1306.05: Major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continuing to do so. So I think it's going to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.35-1310.71: Hopefully we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding, but we'll see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1312.53-1314.41: My follow-up question is with the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1314.43-1323.76: Core merchandise margin ex fuel and a core on core gross margin getting less bad or declining at a lesser rate this quarter than last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.48-1328.27: Is this a sign that the margin here is stabilizing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1328.59-1341.18: And do you think the Costco exits the pandemic with a structurally higher gross margin than it's had in the past, or are all these dynamics simply a function of what you've often said, which is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.20-1345.00: Is when overall retail margins go up, so do costs go down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1345.05-1346.41: But just a little less than others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1347.01-1352.25: Thank you. I think on the last comment, yes, in terms of that last comment you made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1352.65-1355.30: Look, I think at the end of the day,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1355.32-1363.26: I think we in many ways have benefited from market share games, hopefully some or most of which will be sticky. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.60-1369.21: The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.51-1374.77: And arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do because we do our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.81-1384.34: Roughly 200 billion in sales with, you know, 4,000-ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items or 50,000 items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1384.86-1392.89: But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1393.49-1399.78: We'll keep some of that, and we'll use some of it to be even more competitive and hopefully build a bigger moat a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.18-1404.04: But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.22-1413.71: But as some famous TV actress said once, it's always going to be something. And we'll keep fighting that battle out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.85-1421.18: But we feel pretty good about some of the structural things that have occurred that hopefully will help us in the future, but we'll have to wait and see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1423.00-1426.25: Thank you very much and have a good holiday. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1428.17-1433.15: For our next question, we have Simon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simon, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1434.27-1436.74: Hey everyone, I'll be stimming in for this call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.50-1442.22: My first question is actually a follow-up to Michael's second question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.72-1448.93: Maybe I'll ask it a different way, Richard. The two-year core-on-core looks like it's actually getting better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1449.39-1453.63: And you said it yourself, you thought you did a pretty good job on it and it looks like you are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1454.07-1462.56: So if we're kind of getting, it feels like you're managing through the worst of it and the environment may be getting better at the margin, I don't want to go too far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.58-1471.95: And say that why shouldn't be this be the worst for the core on core notwithstanding you know comparisons but the um... Which they get harder but then they start to get easier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.73-1479.02: Yeah, look, I think that's hopefully how the storybook goes. It's always going to be something. But no, look, we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1479.08-1486.79: Jokes aside, we feel pretty good about structurally what we've been able to accomplish and part of that's market share with higher sales levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.11-1496.32: And we've not stopped what I'll call the buyer creativity of working with suppliers to figure out how to continue to drive greater value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.52-1500.10: I can think of 50 examples. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.12-1512.05: At the end of the day, we're continuing to drive value in lots of ways, whether it's changing packaging or using our volume, moving certain production to different parts of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.99-1517.84: And to take, again, to make that mode even a little bigger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.20-1525.04: I agree with you that so far the story that you suggested is playing out and hopefully it'll continue to play out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.17-1530.63: Fair enough. My second question is more on SG&A and the business's leverage point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.17-1538.74: We used to chat about Costco always doing mid-single-digit comps, and that's good enough to cover the SG&A dollar growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1539.22-1543.54: I think this quarter the business did about 6.5% dollar growth adjusted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.96-1550.13: And you're going to have some of these wage investments that will annualize, well, maybe not to the middle or closer to the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1550.59-1554.87: So I'm trying to get at what a normal post-COVID SG&A rate may look like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1555.40-1560.72: And then, you know, does that mean it's sort of that mid-single-digit comp rate that levers those expenses? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1562.40-1567.85: I think it relates to probably the best guesstimate, and I say guesstimate, not estimate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.91-1573.71: Where do you start, where's the inflection point of leveraging SG&A? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1574.03-1576.70: Probably still is in that mid-single-digit range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1578.36-1580.00: Beyond that, who the heck knows? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.24-1586.85: We've been able, notwithstanding some of these increases, we've been able, particularly in wages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.03-1590.75: We've been able, again, strong comps have helped these numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.95-1599.12: I think we feel pretty good about having the sales volumes that continue to be able to leverage those expenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.46-1602.36: As soon as we find out, we'll let you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1602.58-1605.85: But again, we're feeling pretty good about things at this juncture. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1607.29-1611.09: And at some point, I would assume, comps have to come back to him, hopefully. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.11-1619.82: Better than pure average, but you know, something back to where they had been pre-COVID, but on a higher base. And even that helps you a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1621.32-1624.60: Okay, great. Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. You too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.29-1632.15: For the next question, we have Christopher Hovers from JP Morgan. Christopher, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.69-1635.44: Thanks. Good evening, everybody. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1635.90-1644.52: So I wanted to ask a little bit about your thoughts on holiday pull forward. Obviously, you saw an acceleration and trend on a two year basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1644.70-1653.77: In October and then November, things obviously still in amazing comp and gaining share, but trends decelerated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.03-1659.52: You know, it was sort of against what was a weaker, I think, end of the month last year. So. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1659.54-1665.67: Can you talk about what do you think is driving that? How do you think about the rest of the holiday season? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1665.99-1675.78: And as you think about a consumer that's going to lap a bunch of stimulus in the first half of next year, what are your initial thoughts on how that all could play out? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.42-1680.26: I think, again, as you just mentioned,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1680.58-1685.73: November's comps were a shade under outside expectations, still very good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.63-1692.29: A couple of percentage points different than what we had been enjoying a couple of months prior to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.89-1696.52: Probably the view is a little bit of that was pulling forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1697.34-1703.88: But even within last month's number, the weeks varied and overall were good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.96-1710.75: But you know just when you know when it comes reduced a little the next day it's better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1710.91-1712.47: It's better than you expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.95-1718.30: So I think the one thing that I feel good about is our end stocks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1719.16-1728.81: You know, our senior merchant the other day had indicated that his view is that, his feeling is, is that we're better in stock than anybody out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1729.31-1731.89: And I think part of that is the fact of limited selection. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1732.43-1735.50: We are an item business, we could put something else in place or something. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1735.80-1737.58: But we've done a pretty good job. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1738.04-1746.57: I mean, I had a, with a little bit of a chuckle, had a call just yesterday from a reporter asking about how are we doing on cream cheese? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1747.91-1755.12: So I checked and weíre at a cream cheese shortage out there and the bagel shops are being challenged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1755.58-1761.84: We actually got it as the buyer said, it took a little extra work, but we've got all the cream cheese we need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1762.22-1764.08: So I think we've done a good job in merchandising. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.31-1767.33: Got it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1767.55-1776.44: I guess as you think about last year and the stimulus, do you think that – I mean, actually, I think the consumer as you get closer to Christmas and New Year's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1776.82-1785.69: Probably comes back if people are entertaining more like you said on the baking side. But as you get into January and stimulus and stimulus in the spring,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.29-1789.99: Do you think your business lifted off a stimulus last year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.53-1794.51: It couldn't hurt. It probably helped a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.77-1803.00: I know historically when there's been some stimulus items out there, factors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1803.50-1809.97: Our view is that we have not been impacted as much as others, but directionally, we've been impacted the same. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.01-1814.59: Look, if next year there's a reduction in stimulus,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1814.61-1822.04: Lord knows what's going to happen with the stock market in general and how people feel about where they're they have they feel financially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.88-1824.98: That may all change a little bit, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1825.07-1833.49: I feel we feel pretty good around here that in you know one of the things that we've shown over the years that in both in good and bad times we tend to do well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1833.69-1839.18: In good times because people want to spend more and even in less good times people want to save more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1839.38-1848.73: And so I think from a merchandising stand and in tougher times, there's additional products and services that might be willing to sell us for the first time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.15-1858.20: In our own perverse way, we sometimes benefit from good and bad, and right now we're feeling pretty good about what the future looks like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.64-1863.48: Oh, by the way, the other thing that Bob just mentioned... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1863.52-1870.77: That even if certain things head south in some way, shape, or form like reduction or elimination of certain stimulus items,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.63-1880.20: Supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our numbers are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.44-1885.41: Even in some categories in non-food that are up 20 and 30 plus percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1886.37-1894.47: The buyer's view, we're still running out of stuff that could do better if we had more. And that's not just us. I mean, it rains on everybody. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1894.95-1901.88: But I think some improvement in supply chain will be an offset to any other things that are detrimental to that thought. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.56-1909.99: Got it. Thanks very much and enjoy the run on cream cheese at the clubs this weekend. Take care. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1912.43-1920.12: For our next question, we have Chuck Broom from Gordon Hasek. Chuck, your line is open. Hey, this is Bob. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.38-1929.39: Just a question on leverage. If we back up the one-time charges quarter, it looks like you enjoyed over 100 basis points of improvement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.43-1933.05: Year over year at 65 business points last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.49-1941.98: Fully realizing the comps on a stack basis were better, but wondering if some investments or other costs may have rolled off. Just some thoughts on that front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1946.39-1951.07: I think more of it is just the leverage of sales growth, frankly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1952.67-1961.58: Again, taking out the specific COVID-related charges that we talked about, and the fact that what we didn't talk about in terms of separating in the press release,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.60-1969.15: Was that dollar an hour increase we did in March and the new one that had a small impact in Q1 because it started six weeks ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.83-1978.68: But in that regard, there's nothing that stands out in my view, in my estimate. I'm looking at my guys here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1979.50-1983.66: No, no, no. Strong sales would be the number one factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1984.78-1986.03: Okay, okay, fair enough. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.45-1994.95: And then just on the storefront, 14 opened thus far and 22, so you're more than halfway to the goal, which is great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1995.74-2004.92: I was wondering if there are any more discussions to backfill some of your existing markets, your higher density areas where perhaps some stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2005.47-2010.49: You know, just can't handle any more productivity, any more, you know, any more throughput just because of the volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.09-2020.98: I think that's the answer is yes, and I think that'll be small methodical increases in that thought over the next several years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.34-2029.59: I mean, it used to be that we talked about when we had 400 warehouses and the average, I'm making those numbers up, but the average was, you know, 180. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2030.45-2037.14: And now, I think we have an average several years later in the high 200s. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2037.16-2041.14: In the US at least. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2044.12-2052.63: And we have a number of units in the 300 to 400 range. I mean, not hundreds, but tens of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2053.05-2055.90: And so we are looking for more info. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2056.24-2064.56: But we've been doing that, and if it was three to five a year, or three to seven, three to five a year in the last five years, is it going to be five to eight a year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2064.97-2067.29: I don't want to have that kind of detail in front of me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2069.23-2072.39: My last one is just to follow up on Chris's on November. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2072.75-2079.06: I believe you guys did call out that there was some moderation in retail inflation, maybe 150 basis points or so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2079.60-2086.95: I'm just wondering if you could provide any color on where that retail inflation came in and why that happened. Was it self-inflicted? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2087.51-2089.73: Just wanted to give some color there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2092.13-2097.42: One thing that was a little lower was from the increases in food and sundries and some food and sundries items and fresh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.10-2104.74: That had spiked even more. It's still up year over year, but it spiked a little. It came down a little bit from where it had been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.93-2110.23: We haven't quantified anything specific beyond that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2112.31-2120.00: And by the way, as you might expect, there are suppliers out there that are saying, hey, come January, February, you'll see some more increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2120.10-2126.69: Again, this is not inconsistent with what I've read in general articles in the various business periodicals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.25-2131.99: Just a lot of timing differences. Okay. Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2134.83-2140.00: For the next question we have John Hybenboko from Guggenheim. John, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2140.98-2143.60: So so richard how is ks performing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2143.78-2148.15: And what happens or how do you think about it in an inflationary environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2148.37-2157.44: In terms of how you take price versus like items on the national brand side? And does KS do better in an inflationary environment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2161.16-2165.33: Look, many of our KS items are of such large volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.67-2171.51: It's not unlike dealing with the comparable large volumes we do in a branded CPG item. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2172.01-2178.20: And so we're out there fighting with both of them to try to mitigate those cost increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2180.00-2188.59: KS still grows at a little faster rate than others, but nothing discernible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2189.37-2197.04: I think we keep finding new items to do KS with and for a variety of different reasons. And so it continues to drive that brand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2197.32-2201.40: No, I don't think there's a, we don't see a big difference of how that's changing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.08-2209.13: Secondly, 70% on Costco logistics is 70% of your needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2211.09-2220.38: You're at what capacity in logistics? Is it still 50% or is it crooked above that? It's in the 50 range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.94-2230.45: Maybe it's slightly higher than that based on when we originally bought what's now Costville Logistics a year and a half ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.95-2236.76: We've moved over a bunch of volume. We've grown it as well, grown our total base of need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2237.18-2246.79: And I think we're slightly above the 50% that we felt we had capacity for at the time. And we certainly have plenty of capacity over the next few years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.99-2250.39: Mind you, we're spending money on it, part of our fulfillment and logistics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2250.77-2258.60: As I think I mentioned on the last quarterly call, within CapEx, we had spent $340 or so million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2259.18-2266.49: Multi-acre million 1.6 million square foot distribution facility in Southern California. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2267.31-2268.97: And that's for a variety of needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2270.51-2277.40: Some of the, much of what we bought in the Innovel acquisition in March or April of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.92-2286.15: More than 10 million square feet of space around the country, much of it's leased. Much of it's fine, by the way, but we're. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2286.33-2295.34: Not all that was geographically particularly the big sites the million square foot sites were in areas where we're stronger relative to where Sears is stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2295.66-2298.04: Or they had most of their business at the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2298.38-2307.69: So we're still spending money on it and upgrading it. But again, from a merchandising standpoint, we're very excited about it, and it's helped us grow that business in a big way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.21-2317.10: Given our small market share of many of those items, particularly on the appliance side, we feel there's a lot of growth potential for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2318.34-2325.71: Thank you. For the next question, we have Karen Schwartz from Barclays. Karen, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2327.35-2334.07: Hey, thanks very much. I wanted to just talk about ticket a little bit. So US ticket at 3.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2334.39-2344.10: Can you kind of parse that out on units per transaction versus AUP, but also tie that into the inflation numbers that you called out? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2344.12-2346.97: For the quarter and or your expectations on inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.41-2351.89: Honestly, I can't. I don't have that detail or thought in front of me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2353.03-2362.78: You know, generally speaking, you've got electronics that, like TVs and what have you, that are going down in price, maybe a little less this year because there's less promotions because of shortages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2366.03-2375.78: I mean, at every budget meeting, every four weeks, we're presented examples of items where we're taking down the price of high-volume key items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.80-2382.00: By changing the packaging, by moving some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.02-2385.91: Some aspect of manufacturing to another part of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2386.09-2390.83: And so I don't have the detail, Karen, in front of me for that. Sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2391.89-2395.06: And then I wanted to, I don't think this has been asked for a while, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.68-2401.14: Can you give an update maybe on what the average ticket is for executive members versus gold? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.16-2410.87: And then, you know, I know you gave the, obviously you've given the percent of sales, but frequency of executive versus gold, how maybe that's changed over the last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.89-2413.11: You know, almost two years of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2414.25-2415.26: I will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2415.28-2424.78: Somebody's just running out of the room to see if they can grab that sheet and I'll answer it as soon as they get back if you want to ask another question or move on to the next one and but I'll intervene when he gets back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.45-2431.53: Well, my standard question would be just on your cash balance in terms of thoughts on a special dividend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2431.95-2436.22: Well, as soon as we know, you'll know, or the day after. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2436.46-2443.98: Look, our cash position is strong. One of the things I pointed out is our CapEx is also increasing in a conscious way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2445.13-2451.83: Notwithstanding that, our cash flow from operations is growing at quite a stronger rate as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2452.37-2454.39: It's something that we've done four times in eight years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.54-2463.58: We and the shareholders seem to like it when we do it. And so I'm not trying to be cute, but we haven't made that decision at this juncture. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2464.46-2469.39: It's probably a when, not if, but when will be when we do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2471.03-2474.25: And then maybe just while you're waiting for that numbers on the executive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2475.03-2481.38: Can you just maybe give us some color on what percent of freight is actually spot versus contract? I don't know if you've ever given that number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2482.16-2491.79: I don't have the exact number, but I'm willing to bet it's 80 plus percent. I could be wrong a little bit, but it contracted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2492.15-2500.66: Now recognizing with contracts, we might do one, two and three year contracts, so we're still benefiting on three year stuff and benefiting a little on two year stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2500.96-2504.16: And have now gone beyond the benefit of the one-year stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2505.51-2510.41: And so it's over a two or three year period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.75-2515.86: But our assumption is it'll take less than that time to start to normalize somewhat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.40-2523.34: Is it higher today than it was? Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2523.38-2529.45: I think we, again, we probably with other large users of freight and containers,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2529.47-2535.68: Have probably done a pretty good job of at least staggering that, not having to do a lot of spot stuff so far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2536.98-2541.44: Yeah, I mean if you get those numbers on executive and gold on ticket and frequency, that'd be great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2545.83-2551.01: Okay, what they came back with right now is we don't have, I don't have, I don't have quickly average ticket changes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2551.35-2556.62: But the total spend per executive member compared to a Gold Star member is almost 3x. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2558.38-2562.68: Okay, thank you. Call at two and a half. Thank you. Okay, thanks so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2566.25-2572.23: For our next question, we have Greg Mavick from Evercore ISI. Greg, your line's open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2573.49-2579.68: Hi, thanks. I have two questions, Richard. One is digging a little bit into the gross margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2579.80-2586.61: You said gas and travel have helped but then offset by e-commerce. Could you sort of explain where... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.65-2590.61: So that was gas penny profit was up even at the mixer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2595.62-2600.06: Margin percent was down, but you've got a 40, 50% increase in price per gallon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2600.82-2606.11: So you still might have more pennies per gallon, but the margin itself was down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2606.83-2611.35: Got it. And then that was offset by e-commerce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2611.83-2621.24: Well, e-commerce is, yeah, and again, I wouldn't read a lot into any of that description. We're just trying to share with everyone directionally what helps it and hurts it a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2621.94-2627.71: E-commerce, just given all the activity we've gotten expenditures on fulfillment and expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2628.09-2635.28: And do it when we can, you know, over time when we're pulling tickets if we, if something else happened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2636.66-2638.16: I don't view as a big issue for my. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.50-2641.08: It's not, whether the margin's up a little or down a little. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2641.32-2647.13: It's less about competition and more about what's the product mix that month or week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2647.41-2651.83: And what else is going on with this rapid expansion and investment in it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2653.59-2657.22: And then maybe to tie back your discussion on the logistics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2657.68-2666.05: Big and bulky, if we look at e-commerce as roughly 8% of sales, is big and bulky a quarter of that? Is that the kind of scale we're talking about? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.99-2669.71: It's over a third. It's over a third. Great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2672.87-2674.61: And then last but not least. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2675.40-2684.52: The renewal rates are continuing to tick up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2684.54-2693.01: Shouldn't that come off at some point, just given that you have more first-year members? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2694.41-2696.68: When he gets to 100. No, just kidding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2697.78-2702.54: I think, as I mentioned earlier in this when I was speaking,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2704.00-2709.03: Probably the single biggest thing that's helping it right now is auto renewals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2709.59-2717.20: As we get more people on a credit card, both in the two big co-branded in the US and Canada, that's a no-brainer to help a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2717.52-2725.79: As we convert people to executive member and as we, for every hundred new people signing up, a slightly higher number of them sign up as executive members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2726.21-2728.63: They are more likely to renew. So those things help as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2730.49-2734.61: The thing I mentioned about new warehouses and markets around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2735.72-2743.20: Tend to be, while they have a very much lower renewal rate in their first year of renewal or year two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2743.78-2747.15: Then that'll continue to grow as more people have renewed the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2747.91-2752.43: Those are starting at, generally, those are starting at higher rates than they were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2752.57-2753.95: So all those things help a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2754.65-2762.86: I'd like to think it's all the wonderful things we do and the value proposition, but certainly auto renew is probably a good help there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2763.98-2771.51: And then last, because someone has to ask it, just fee increase, I guess back half next year is when it will be five years since the last one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2773.65-2780.24: What are the thoughts on that, just given that members seem to be self-selecting the fee hike already through the executive membership? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2780.80-2783.78: Does that change your thought process as to when you might hike the fee? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2785.09-2789.79: No, and our only thought is we'll probably start getting questions about now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2791.85-2794.17: So, but it's still a while away and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2794.93-2803.00: We certainly feel good, as I've said in the past, the renewal rates, strong renewal rates and loyalty help that process, so that thought process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2804.08-2808.23: And we'll see, but it's still a little bit of time to think about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2808.89-2811.55: We'll have a great holiday season, everyone. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2813.97-2819.64: For our next question, we have Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2820.28-2821.92: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2822.22-2828.87: So I wanted to touch on Canada and other internationals. We saw a strong and accelerating two-year conference for both Canada and other international. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2829.19-2833.27: Is there any more color you can provide in terms of maybe what you're seeing in those geographies? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2837.92-2846.63: A little help here. It's probably most, I agree, it's probably most about how COVID impacted different countries differently timing-wise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2847.21-2855.54: I remember a year ago, a year and a half ago, some of the foreign countries did better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2855.56-2857.46: While we were being locked down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2857.74-2867.63: And then a little later, they got locked down. And so part of it is, you know, one of the reasons I think everybody's picked up on the two-year stack concept, but I think that's as much as anything, that's the reason. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2869.17-2875.72: Okay, great. And then as you look at your ancillary businesses, is there a way you can find an update in terms of how they're trending now versus pre-pandemic? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2878.20-2886.91: I don't have that detail with me, but generally speaking, tires are picked up as an example. It's not an ancillary business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2888.11-2891.51: The Costco auto program is down because there's a shortage of cars out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2892.71-2895.54: Travel is up, not where it was pre. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2895.68-2905.45: It was almost back to where it was pre-COVID, and then Delta variant hit. And then it was coming back again, and then Omicron hit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2906.03-2909.21: And so it fluctuates pretty quickly on the com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2910.79-2912.93: And I'm trying to think of the other things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2913.57-2918.06: Food courts have come back. I don't think they're quite where they were, but they're almost there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2919.34-2924.16: Hearing aids have come back, but still, I think, slightly below pre-pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.19-2932.83: Thought school's doing great. Pharmacy's doing great, helped, frankly, by the shots. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2934.17-2938.60: We, like other retail pharmacies, are providing plenty of vaccines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2941.20-2942.52: Okay, great. Thank you, Farley Culler. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2945.43-2951.97: For our next question, we have Stephanie Winsick from Jeffries. Stephanie, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2954.51-2956.54: Good afternoon, this is Blake on First Step. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2957.28-2963.52: First question would be higher level. You guys are a big proponent of the in-store shopping experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2963.78-2968.93: It seems like store sales have been fairly strong as of late for retailers. So wondering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2969.17-2977.28: You know, how have your, how's your in-store shopping compared versus e-com versus your expectations recently? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2977.30-2980.40: And then maybe if you can share any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2980.42-2989.81: E-comm pilots you might have that you've been working on. I know you mentioned you did a pickup test, but you discontinued that. Anything maybe in the works that you can share? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2991.03-2996.28: Well, both in-store and online have picked up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2997.58-3002.62: You know, the pickup from things like Instacart for Same Day Fresh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3002.66-3008.91: Skyrocketed during the lockdowns in mid to late summer 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3009.33-3013.21: Came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3014.59-3018.04: E-commerce is you as you know because we talked about every quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3018.06-3025.99: There's, you know, eight or nine percent of our sales on a company that is 192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3026.29-3034.01: That's a lot bigger than it was two years ago. I think the last three or four quarters, the two-year stack is 100 plus percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3035.52-3044.18: But notwithstanding that, and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in store anyway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3045.17-3054.49: The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that now we're standing some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them in back in May of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3055.34-3059.58: I think overall people felt if I've got to go out, I'm going to go out to one place and bulk up on stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3059.98-3066.47: And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically that's helped a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3066.89-3073.91: At the end of the day, we were all surprised by, if you go back to March of 2020,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3073.93-3077.90: We're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3077.94-3080.78: Summer and fall of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3080.82-3089.43: Much less now, much the same now, it was because people weren't traveling and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3089.83-3094.61: And we certainly had, on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3094.83-3099.96: That was a pleasant surprise to us and that's continued. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3101.88-3107.71: In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean, we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online and pick up in store. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3108.05-3114.75: Warp, as I mentioned on the call, you know, have over a year from now have over 200 of our US warehouses with lockers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3117.14-3120.26: In terms of buying online and pick up a store, we're not quite sure about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3121.20-3126.77: We have very busy locations, there's not a lot of room for it, and it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3126.85-3134.35: Or over half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online in the lockers, they come in and shop while they're there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3134.87-3143.14: And so, and that's what we want. So, beyond that, I don't think, I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3144.02-3151.43: Some of these things everybody else have. We are sometimes late to the game on some of these things. But those should be all net additive to what we do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3154.23-3158.34: That's super helpful. I was also wondering on your inventory positioning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3159.82-3167.53: How much are you getting ahead of any seasonal items or any challenges you may foresee for Q2 and Q3 for the spring and summer? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3170.31-3179.14: I don't know exactly. I know that consciously they advised when they presented the budget meetings are talking about those issues. We are bringing in things early. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3179.38-3188.99: We certainly have, you know, you think about it, what we call our depot, our view of distribution system in the US was something like 10 million square feet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3189.37-3193.31: And we essentially slightly more than doubled that with the Innovel acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3193.69-3198.14: Aside from other things, that helps us with a little storage if we need it or bringing in things early. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3198.90-3206.19: And recognizing we start with, we are somewhat seasonal, but historically we've always brought things in early anyway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3206.65-3210.33: So whatever it may be, we certainly have the cash, as somebody mentioned earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3210.85-3217.02: To have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory, even if it hangs around for a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3217.36-3220.00: But I think overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3220.06-3223.44: Some of our items are still a little later than they would be pre-COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3223.82-3231.55: But better than they would be if we were not doing as good a job as I think we are doing on forward buying. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3233.87-3240.74: Perfect. If I could sneak one last one in. I might have missed it, but I think you said for the net new openings this year, you said 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3240.92-3245.85: I thought the last quarter you were aiming more towards 25. Is there anything to call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3246.77-3253.69: I said it was 19 more in the last three quarters of the year, the fiscal year, plus the 8 and 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3255.48-3265.27: Perfect. Thank you very much. For our next question, we have Paul Lewis from Citi. Paul, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3266.69-3275.26: Hey, everyone this Brandon for Paul. I was, I was wondering if we could talk about the increasing catbacks. I think last we spoke we thought. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3275.86-3280.94: You know, the FX would have a three in front of it. Now it sounds like it has a four in front of it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3281.02-3282.06: I'm just wondering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3282.08-3288.39: Was there a change in the strategy there, and specifically on the e-com investments? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.41-3295.16: Do you feel like you're playing some catch up there or laying the groundwork for growth? Just anything that you can share with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3296.00-3303.36: Sure, I think in the previous, as it relates to this year, we had talked about, I think, 3.8 to 4.2, quote unquote. Now we're saying about 4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3304.64-3311.83: These numbers are up from the mid-3s over the last couple of years, low to mid-3s over the last couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3311.85-3321.78: Last year's 3-6 included a $340 or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest in Southern California. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3321.80-3326.29: Which is basically a million and a half plus square foot facility with lots of acreage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3326.31-3329.41: To help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3330.61-3338.86: So I think there's, if you said, what are the big things taking you from the low threes to the low fours over a few years of period? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3339.78-3344.82: It's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive per location. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3345.27-3353.01: More expansion, you know, we in fiscal 20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3353.41-3357.98: I think we were 20 and 21, and we're going to be 27 net new units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3358.32-3361.80: This fiscal year plus five reloads, which is six reloads planned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3363.14-3364.32: We might miss that a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3364.58-3371.29: At the end of the day, so there's more warehouses, clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3371.61-3376.76: Starting with the billion dollar acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3377.12-3385.97: Starting with adding additional square footage to that, as well as the international thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3386.01-3393.79: And even on the distribution side, or what we call our cross-stock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.81-3395.44: In a better way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3395.70-3400.72: Actually building a mini depot in Hawaii where we have five locations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3401.82-3410.93: Seven, I'm sorry, seven locations, but huge volume locations. And with the, so we've gotten to the volume and efficiency there that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3410.95-3412.85: These are good investments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3412.87-3414.35: So it's a lot of those things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3414.57-3420.86: Mind you, we still spend all in close to a billion dollars a year in IT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3424.36-3427.49: And that's how we should kind of think about it going forward, long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3429.19-3432.09: By the way, that's not all CapEx, that's expenses as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3432.53-3439.86: Go ahead, I'm sorry. And the 4 billion range is what we should think about APEX for the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3441.96-3445.59: I don't know for the long term, I think four sounds about right for the next year or two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3446.03-3449.17: And if things continue to grow well, go well and grow well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3450.41-3459.80: Maybe it goes up from there a little bit. But we're not looking to spend it if we don't think we have good things to spend it on just because our cash flow has been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3459.84-3462.62: Exceeding net income plus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3463.18-3469.33: Cash flow has been exceeding regular dividend plus capital expenditures and the like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3472.41-3478.82: And you also mentioned that you're able to change out products when you're faced with shortages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3479.74-3483.46: I was wondering if you could quantify that versus kind of a normal quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3483.92-3491.91: And if you are switching out more than usual, what impact does that have on consumer behavior there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3491.93-3494.61: And anything on the logistics side as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3495.26-3503.12: I think it's, I don't have the exact number, but my guess is it's a small, low to mid single digit percentage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3503.80-3512.17: What it means, though, is when going all the way back to spring of 2020, and people were hoarding goods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3512.41-3519.74: We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get, recognizing from their perspective, it creates a new relationship, which we'll honor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3520.00-3523.08: Going forward, not just for the three months that we needed it then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3523.68-3532.11: So I think there were opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity to some things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3532.41-3541.92: And with I think the going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3542.14-3549.21: Both patio furniture and lawn garden and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.15-3556.12: We took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more that than anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3557.24-3558.82: And the treasure hunt. Yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3558.98-3561.56: So it's still a small piece, but I think it's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3561.58-3569.85: Sometimes when I go into some retailers, I'm not going to name names, but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3570.41-3572.03: First of all, why don't you put something there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3572.25-3577.78: But at the end of the day, I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3580.62-3581.86: Thanks and good luck for all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3585.17-3590.07: For our next question, we have Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3591.25-3592.97: Hi, good afternoon guys. Happy holidays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3593.73-3598.78: Richard, I wanted to ask you, of course, more, you know, all things considered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3599.46-3604.60: Any additional thoughts that you can share? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3604.62-3612.87: For a reason we should expect some incremental, you know, somewhat similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3614.15-3621.30: You were breaking up entirely during that call, so I heard about every other word, if you want to repeat yourself. Yeah, sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3621.74-3626.37: So I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. As you said, pretty good, all things considered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3626.89-3633.91: Any additional thoughts you can share on the current quarter? Comparisons in the core look similar, I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3634.19-3638.32: I'm just wondering if there's any reason we should expect any incremental pressure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3640.32-3643.98: From a competitive standpoint, I mean, there's lots of companies, everybody's competitive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3644.84-3648.61: Again, I think structurally our model allows us to benefit from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3649.57-3655.18: We talked about more pennies per gallon of profit. That allows us to do some other things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3656.72-3661.88: I think we have a lot of levers to pull here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3662.04-3669.93: And we feel pretty good that we are able to hold the prices on key items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3670.07-3676.32: And to, I don't really think that we consider the challenge of achieving a margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3676.58-3682.94: We're pretty good at figuring out how to get there while still being the company we are in terms of competitiveness. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3683.14-3686.45: So no big changes of what we see out there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3687.41-3694.27: It's just there's a lot of changes every month and some things go up and some things go down, but overall we feel pretty good about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3695.70-3702.26: All right, and then just one for a little bit more big picture just around customer data. I was hoping maybe you could just provide an update on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3702.82-3712.55: Things like personalization. And then media is something that we hear a lot of people talk about. Maybe just any thoughts on what you're doing with that opportunity as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3713.57-3723.38: I think there's still low-hanging fruit on the tree here. We've talked about it a little bit. We've done a little bit more targeting than we have ever done, but very little. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3723.92-3725.31: There is more to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3726.71-3736.12: It was just a year and a half ago that we hired someone at a relatively senior level in terms of data analytics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3737.06-3741.38: But that's not the only thing they're working on in the group that he's put together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3741.78-3750.71: But, you know, so I think those are things that'll come over time in the next few years. That's pretty much what I can tell you about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3752.61-3759.40: Thank you. Okay, I'm going to take two more questions, Sadie. Will do, sir. And for the next question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3759.50-3764.22: Have Laura Champagne from Loop Capital. Laura, the line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3765.15-3767.55: Thanks Richard, mine will be quick. It's a follow on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3767.71-3772.69: You mentioned that renewal rates are still headed higher in part because of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3772.71-3779.02: Likely because of the auto renew. What percentage of your membership is on auto renew at this point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3785.79-3792.55: It's about 50 in the US and Canada, which would imply, and that's really where we have it, where we have the co-brand cards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3794.97-3799.74: And US and Canada is about 80% of our companies, so the 50 becomes a 40 if you, rough numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3801.38-3808.51: Got it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3810.59-3811.81: Understood. Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3815.24-3821.78: For our last question, we have Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Kelly, lines have been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3823.30-3825.13: Oh, thanks for squeezing me in here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3826.13-3835.74: I just wanted to talk, Richard, about the inflationary environment. Youíve talked a little bit in the past couple quarters about how your price gaps have widened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3836.58-3846.25: Do you think this kind of magnitude of inflation is just good for Costco's business? I mean, have you seen anything like this in the past where it could. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3846.27-3849.03: Possibly just drive even more volume into your doors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3851.43-3857.60: I mean, from an argument that things are more costly, on the one hand, maybe it reduces demand overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3857.88-3862.06: In the sense that we're the extreme value proposition that helps us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3863.56-3871.99: Who the heck knows? I think what I was reading this morning in the paper was this is the highest inflation in so many years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3873.41-3882.00: It wasn't that long ago, though, 10 plus years ago, that regular inflation was 2 or 3% a year. And of course, it's going to be a little more for a year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3882.40-3888.79: But at the end of the day, I think it helps us a little because of the value proposition that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3892.51-3897.34: That makes sense and a lot has been asked here, but just wanted to also just check on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3897.36-3904.78: Self-checkout and where you are with that and if there's any color you can help us understand on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3904.80-3912.79: The savings or the impact on the cost structure when you put in some self-checkout and the potential for that initiative going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3914.35-3921.10: We pretty much have it now in most locations, and I'm speaking of the US and Canada. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3921.58-3930.77: And I know even across the street in many locations we've expanded it from originally two lanes of three or six to three lanes of three or even four lanes of three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3931.77-3935.02: So in a four lane area, you could have 12 people checking out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3936.54-3945.21: So my guess is it's still going to grow a little as we expand existing units to offer a little bit more of it. And it's been a positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3955.06-3960.48: Well, thank you everyone, and have a good holiday season, and we're around to answer additional questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3966.89-3971.73: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
