asr:0: OUTPUT 88.39-96.24: We have in this year, we are budgeting and we are seeing better prices than last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 96.26-105.35: And higher margins comparing to last year, having some bigger input costs in some like fertilizers much more bigger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 106.37-111.21: But margins since comparing this year to last year are a little higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 112.95-118.72: We related to the real estate business. So remembering that we have three lines of businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 118.80-123.68: One is the production size and the yields on the production.

asr:0: OUTPUT 128.13-137.68: Related to the real estate in the first quarter, we have only news in Brazil. In this quarter, we have no news in Argentina and in the rest of the countries.

asr:0: OUTPUT 180.00-183.60: Related to the quarter of production,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 183.64-206.31: We were driven by the sugar cane activity. In here, that activity gave us much better results and was mainly explained by the frozen that the country received in the winter that made a big loss in the southern regions of Brazil. And that made an increase, a very important increase in the sugar cane prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 206.35-210.33: Combined with the oil prices increased. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 210.41-216.14: So the combination of the two made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugarcane. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 216.16-221.26: And in our case, our plantations were in regions that they were not affected in production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 221.30-225.75: So that combination made us a big gain and in the others a good quarter too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 227.59-231.23: Related to the all effect on our balance sheets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 231.27-237.74: We see a net gain that was mainly explained by this gross profit, financial result and income tax.

asr:0: OUTPUT 330.23-337.74: In the graph to the left about stock conceptions, the soybean, the corn stocks remain globally low. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 337.76-346.31: Having soybean about 27.7% and corn 25.4%.

asr:0: OUTPUT 355.01-362.64: Having soybean about 7.3% and corn 10.1% respectively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.24-369.67: These stock conceptions have a relation about the commodity prices.

asr:0: OUTPUT 471.89-479.00: Thank you, everybody. When we go to the next page, we can see what happened in the farmland sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 479.36-482.62: And these two operational transactions were done in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 484.58-487.07: None of them was reflected on the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 488.09-496.32: Because we are putting transactions that they are surpassing some level of payment and giving possession. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 496.74-502.68: And that was not accomplished on the 30th of September, none in the two cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 503.66-508.59: The two cells are in two different regions. The first one, Rio de Mayo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 508.75-515.46: But it was done in September. Productive area that we sold is 2.9 thousand hectares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.00-523.32: That we bought for 40 million reais and we sold for 130 million reais in a nominal sale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 524.12-530.49: Remember that in Brazil we sell installments related to bags of soybeans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 530.83-536.14: So when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 536.40-540.50: And we made the internal rate of return with the present value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.52-548.49: And giving us in the first case an internal rate of return in reales of 56% and in the case of dollars 40%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 548.99-558.26: That was a transaction done when we did the merge with Agrifirma that we merged through paying through shares of Brasilagro. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 558.42-560.00: And in this case... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.66-565.09: Only selling a third of the farm will recover what we paid for the whole farm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 565.47-571.67: So it was a big gain. It is a very important gain for the first quarter doing this small transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.39-573.53: The second one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.55-583.04: That it was done in October 21, still not recognized, and probably will be on the 31st of December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 583.54-588.03: In here we are selling a productive area of 2.7 thousand hectares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 588.51-592.97: For a total number of 589 million Reais. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.61-601.72: This is bigger than the first IPO the company did, only selling 2.7 thousand hectares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 602.10-606.09: So a small look at what is that price per hectare. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 606.51-616.02: It is depending on the present value or nominal value, 30,000 or more, or 40,000 or more reales, dollars per hectare. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 616.50-622.16: $40,000 or $30,000 or more in the present or nominal value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.42-626.19: So give us the revaluation of the land in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 626.63-630.09: This is a transaction that will be recognized in two steps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 630.89-637.38: First step, it is more than half, 1.5 thousand, sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 637.76-645.91: Hectares of productive area in the first tranche and the second tranche would be like 1.1 thousand hectares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.43-647.85: In 2024. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 648.21-655.94: So this is a big transaction, giving us a big gain for this year and for the 2024 too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 656.42-662.18: And internal rate of return. This farm we bought in 2007, if I don't remember incorrectly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 662.40-668.45: So a long story, giving us like 20% in reais or 12% in dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 668.79-678.10: A big gain. And again, when we see a farm at 3% return, we sell it and we begin to invest it in another area or another activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 678.52-685.43: So first semester or first quarter with activity in Brazil, but still not reflected in our balance sheets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.87-688.61: We can move now to page number six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.89-699.52: We would like to every quarter to be mentioning some of what our agriculture services are doing. Here in this page we are reflecting the two, FEO and Agri-Fi. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 700.00-704.52: A field where Cresud owns 50.1%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 704.92-711.81: And let's see what is the commercialization status. This company became the first of the country by far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.21-718.88: Commercializing grains, inputs, futures and options, services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 719.22-723.66: So this company that today, this year surpassed 6.4%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 723.84-732.09: And we can see the breakdown of what is our participation on the corn, wheat and soybeans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 732.43-737.48: This company became by more than 2 million tons bigger than the competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 737.88-743.14: And this is making really a big gain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 743.18-750.55: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.87-753.99: Coming five, six years ago, close to break even. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.19-757.54: So this company is becoming relevant to Curaçao. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 758.04-761.90: And to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 761.92-770.53: Went to the market and raised $12.3 million at a zero interest rate through the local capital market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 770.71-771.91: In two years period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 772.05-779.48: So this will be for investment in fixed assets and working capital, but this company is mainly employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.50-782.50: This year is passing more employees than presumed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 783.16-788.39: FIO is close to 300 employees. Cresud Agriculture in Argentina is something like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 788.81-797.00: This company is pure services to farmers from the inputs to the exports for the commodities and the specialties.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1182.84-1186.67: Basically a dollar terms similar with the previous quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.11-1194.81: But when we convert that into pesos and then compare with inflation, inflation was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.83-1204.14: Levels of 9% during the quarter and the evaluation of the official exchange rate was only 3% or the blue chip swap was 7%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.54-1209.91: So that effect generates losses in pesos term in the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1214.61-1222.96: So we can move to the next page, page 10, that here we have the breakdown of the adjusted data by segment.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.52-1325.01: Regarding the urban segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.53-1334.05: Here it's more difficult to compare. We are comparing with an operation in the malls that was closed during the previous year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1334.31-1338.76: So here you can see that last year we posted a loss. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1338.98-1346.09: This year we are recovering with almost normal operation in terms of revenues. We will have some concessions, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1346.11-1353.95: Going forward that that will disappear. So we are now running with a complete normal operation.
