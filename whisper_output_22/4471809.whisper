asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.14-1266.87: Which will enable the group to increase the output of high octane motor gasoline and commence production of polymerization grade propylene to be used as feedstock at our petrochemical facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.39-1274.69: I would also like to note that the delayed COCA in Nizhny Novgorod and the catalytic cracking unit in Perm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1274.71-1279.86: Are conducted under the agreements with Russia's Ministry of Energy providing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1279.88-1285.63: For an investment increment in the reverse excise tax on petroleum-paid stocks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.23-1290.89: Now let me briefly outline the major drivers behind our financial performance in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1293.81-1296.80: Client sales volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1296.82-1299.86: With a key factor driving revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.44-1309.15: And this comes in company with high prices so we have a revenue increase of 18% quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1311.51-1318.58: And then again it's both own production and larger trading volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.26-1325.23: Our EBITDA hit an all-time high of £355 billion, up 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.53-1329.19: We have already spoken in detail on EBITDA drivers for each segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.65-1339.52: I would also like to note that EBITDA increase was dragged by the effect of inventory release in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.98-1351.37: As we sold part of our inventory back then. Hence the contribution of this, that and the third quarter's material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1352.47-1363.98: Let me once again remind you that for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, our quarterly results saw almost no impact from one of our carrying over factors going to the normalized market environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1365.01-1371.43: The company posted in its profits of 192 billion Rebos, nearly flat, quote-unquote. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1372.05-1380.46: The EBITDA growth was partially offset by the effective income tax rate rising from 17% to 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1380.84-1386.75: Which was due to intragroup asset sales as we streamlined our business in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1386.99-1391.93: The profit growth was also constrained by high depreciation on the back of rising production volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1392.63-1401.52: Pre-cash flow in the third quarter hit an all-time high of 228 billion rubles, up more than twofold quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1402.26-1406.93: At the working capital expanded by about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.95-1412.63: 100 billion rubles in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.89-1418.36: In the third quarter, the working capital change was minimal, only standing at 6 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1418.70-1427.69: Free cash flow before changes in the working capital totaled 234 billion rubles, up 10% quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1429.03-1437.58: The key driver behind this growth was stronger operating cash flow on the back of rising business margins driven by an improved market environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.00-1446.57: And also high production and throughput volumes. Before I conclude, let me briefly talk about our expectations for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1447.87-1452.69: Given the existing decisions of the OPEC Plus members to increase oil output,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.11-1458.22: We expect hydrocarbon production to grow by about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.00-1466.83: By about 4% year-on-year, excluding the West Kona II project in Iraq. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.31-1477.26: In downstream, we expect our refining volumes to grow by up to 5% year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.58-1487.55: As for our investment activities, we expect the 2021 capital expenditures, excluding the West Carnegie project, to be within 450 billion ribbles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1488.07-1496.52: The lower figure compared to our previously announced plans is explained by a savings achieved and partial cost transfer to 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1496.72-1504.70: With its unique set of competitive advantages, Lukoil continues to boast a strong and appealing investment story in the global oil and gas sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.21-1512.07: Thanks to our superb flexibility and high-quality asset mix, we have been able to maximize the benefits from the market recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.37-1517.36: Transforming it into a shareholder resource using our effective dividend policy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1517.48-1526.25: We are optimistic about the prospects for oil demand and believe that we are in a position to continue developing our business across the board in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.27-1528.13: Quantity and quality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1528.15-1532.43: With a dear account for climate change and sustainability agenda at large. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.27-1540.48: We plan to present the company's updated strategy in March of next year along with the fourth quarter financial results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1541.50-1545.09: Thank you. Now for your attention, and we are ready to take your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.99-1553.63: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.33-1558.86: If you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question, please press star 1 again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1560.06-1564.18: I would like to remind you that questions from the press will not be accepted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.19-1571.89: Please ask questions in the corresponding language, in Russian for the Russian line and in English for the English line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.47-1574.81: You will be advised when to ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.02-1583.12: The first question comes from the Russian line from Karen Kostanian calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.23-1598.06: Yes, thank you for this presentation, gentlemen. Congratulations on your great results. I have two questions. One pertains to the high viscosity oil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1598.56-1600.18: Now, when are you expecting? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.56-1609.41: When you're expecting an outcome from your arrangements with the government and if this agreement is achieved,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1610.33-1617.78: By how much would you intend to increase your CAPEX and the output of oil in the fields in question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1618.10-1621.92: And my other question pertains to Devin from Gaspar Neft. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.30-1630.47: I'm not sure whether you have mentioned that, but when are you expecting the first oil to be coming? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1634.41-1638.16: Okay, let me handle your first question. On the 11th of November this year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1639.18-1646.93: The Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Mishustin, signed the government instruction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1646.95-1650.95: To the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1651.07-1659.58: In Q1, the two ministries are to prepare proposals of how high viscosity oil fields are to be treated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1659.88-1669.57: Several options are being discussed currently. One option suggests that from 2022 onwards, high viscosity oil could be involved in production again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1669.69-1675.56: The company is working at the same time to fast track that time frame. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.38-1685.89: We could be assisted if OPEC plus quota is increased with less of a constraint so that we could increase the total oil output. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.17-1695.66: At this point in time, I cannot provide you with any further details, hence it's too early to discuss the CAPEX. We have a CAPEX plan, but then it will depend on the decision made by the government. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.92-1704.76: What's most important is that there is a decision pending. So in Q1, we'll see some parameters defined, and then we'll be able to discuss those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.05-1710.15: This definitely improves the situation as compared to a situation of totally cancelled tax incentives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.61-1717.96: And regarding your second question, that's Mr. Zhdanov speaking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1718.46-1723.36: We have not provided any of the parameters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1723.42-1732.31: From NEFTA, to be closed early next year and a lot of work is still pending to prepare the production plan, we will update you accordingly. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1733.03-1740.72: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.74-1743.56: Colin from JP Morgan, please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1750.03-1754.79: Good afternoon. Thank you for an opportunity to ask a question. And I have a quick one on your CAPEX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1755.84-1761.20: Now, if you could, please share an indication for some indicative capex for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.70-1770.99: Previously you mentioned a number of around 500 billion but now you have suggested some of the CAPEX from this year will be transferred into next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.19-1773.51: So can you update the next year's figure? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.50-1786.13: Mr. Pogos, Dan is speaking, considering our outlook for 2022, we're finalizing our budget for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.29-1788.57: And the board of directors is to approve it in December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1790.43-1797.98: The basic APEX target is 550 billion rebels, excluding risk in two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1799.50-1806.67: And again, we have the flexibility, depending on the market environment, we can further update this number next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1810.03-1819.52: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1825.09-1833.11: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation. I have three questions and all are related to upstream economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1835.42-1840.38: Could you suggest when the driver field is expected to be loached? That's question one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1840.64-1846.89: My question, too, is a follow-up to Karen's question on the JV with gas from NIPS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1848.83-1858.36: Can you confirm whether or not the JV will include some of the fields already launched by GazpromNet on its own? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.04-1862.44: As part of their next to guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1863.32-1867.97: And my third question has a more philosophical nature. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1868.47-1881.30: Now if one assumes that the market environment is favorable price wise and the OPIC plus constraints are lifted with no negative developments of the taxation side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1881.76-1888.21: So what would be your estimate of the production growth potential for Lukoil in Russia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1889.31-1892.97: I understand that your strategy may be different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1894.87-1904.02: From the actual opportunities that you see in the market but what's your thinking, what's your organic growth? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1904.28-1906.99: Of production based on these inputs. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1916.70-1924.54: On question one, the polygraphy field is expected to be launched at the end of 2022. That's our estimate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.01-1931.53: Second question, well, one field, the Tarsovsky field has been launched. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.35-1939.62: That's the anchor field, and there is a number of other fields which are the part of the JV to be launched further. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.98-1943.56: Regarding the production growth potentially high foliar question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.76-1953.85: You are asking about specific plans of production growth rather than some abstract plans because if you consider our resource base, that's large scale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1954.13-1963.58: And our mid-term and long-term plans are there with major changes to those plans given the constraints of the OPEC Plus agreement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.30-1971.03: That agreement is still in place and we cannot know for how long these would last in the future. However, as part of our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1971.05-1976.64: Mid-term plan, we would intend to ramp up back to the pre-crisis production numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1977.14-1984.82: In terms of daily flows, that would be next year. In terms of the full year, that would be 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.27-1996.12: We have very specific plans how to grow it further from that level onwards based on the pre-crisis plans to 83, 84 million tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1998.54-2000.48: Within three years in Russia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2002.46-2011.51: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.53-2012.69: Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.68-2019.70: A question on the delayed cochrane, Mr. Nobgeta, once it's launched. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.28-2028.57: It looks like you're finishing it very quickly. How long will it take to ramp up to full capacity? In other words, how long will the testing period be? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.49-2053.69: Done speaking construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2054.79-2063.44: Is going to be finished pretty soon in Q1 2022. So we would expect the unit to ramp up to the design capacity in the first half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2075.22-2084.58: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.50-2108.51: My question relates to your CAPEX for 2021. This year, that is, you have suggested a number of 450 billion Dribbles excluding the West Kona 2 project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.81-2112.81: In your accounts, I see the nine month number standing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2112.83-2119.30: Slightly above 280 billion maybe you could realistically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2119.66-2124.32: Assume a number of up to 400 billion rubles rather than 415. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2124.72-2130.57: And how much of the costs have been transferred over to next year? Is that about 50 billion? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2142.46-2151.33: Indeed, some of the costs have been transferred and we suggest it would be somewhat more than $20 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2152.35-2156.80: So we still maintain our guidance and then there is some savings, of course. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2157.12-2162.94: So we would still maintain our guidance for 2021 at 450 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2162.96-2168.37: There is seasonality and one would suggest that Q4 will be slightly higher. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2173.87-2180.50: Alexander Poligota speaking. We see there are no further questions on the line. Thank you for taking part in this call. So see you next time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2184.06-2188.43: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. You may now replace your hands. 
asr:0: END
