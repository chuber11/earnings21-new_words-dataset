asr:0: OUTPUT 170.53-176.46: Our earnings during the third quarter of 2021 were significantly higher than earnings reported. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 176.48-178.50: During the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 179.02-186.25: These results were driven by considerably higher sales volumes and prices across almost all our business lines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 186.95-192.95: We continue seeing very positive market conditions in all of the markets in which we participate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 193.55-197.18: The man-made lithium market is exceeding our previous expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 197.56-206.39: The agritainment market has recovered from the pandemic faster than anticipated, while we are also seeing a positive trend in the fertilizer market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 207.23-212.57: We are now expecting that the lithium market demand should grow close to 50% this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 212.59-218.94: Driven by strong sales of electric vehicles in all relevant markets, especially in China and Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.64-226.29: The capacity expansions we have been working on are allowing us to grow even more than. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 226.75-231.03: Lady Nars reached close to 100,000 metric tons in sales volume this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 231.71-240.84: By the middle of next year, our expansion to 180,000 metric tons should be ready, allowing us to keep on growing our sales volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 242.02-250.47: This accelerated leasing market growth is pressuring prices. At the same time, the contracts we signed last year are expiring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 251.01-256.72: These allow us to expect an average sales price higher than $12,000 per metric ton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.06-261.38: During the fourth quarter and probably even higher during the first quarter next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 262.18-267.09: In the meanwhile, the IUD market demand has already reached the pre-pandemic level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 267.67-273.29: This quick recovery has had a positive impact on prices as supply has not been able to respond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 273.81-280.22: We are now expecting total sales in 2021 around 12.5 thousand metric tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 280.52-286.81: With average sales prices increasing from prices seen over the past few quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.59-292.31: As we are working on expanding our IONING capacity, we expect to ramp up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 292.33-301.16: Additional 1,000 metric tons in the beginning of 2023, followed by approximately 2.5 thousand metric tons in 2024. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 301.60-304.54: All part of our early announced growth plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 305.45-310.11: We have seen some very interesting developments in the fertilizer markets globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.51-314.67: Supply has been impacted by export restrictions and logistic interruption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 315.16-322.12: The spot prices for both potash and potassium nitrate fertilizer have reached levels not seen in more than a decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 322.68-329.21: We now expect our potassium and potassium nitrate average prices to reach almost $700. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 329.23-333.99: And over $1,000 per metric tonne respectively during the fourth quarter this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 334.61-336.60: Considering all the positive factors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 337.02-343.72: We now anticipate a record performance during the fourth quarter this year with a significantly higher EBDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 344.12-347.63: We remain confident in our ability to deliver future growth.

asr:0: OUTPUT 376.44-379.86: If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 380.64-387.03: To withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 391.25-398.26: Our first question today comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 401.60-403.34: I'm going to ask a few questions one by one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 404.62-413.21: Can we look into your production for next year for lithium? You've got to 120 already LCE. You'll get to 180 some point next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 413.87-419.04: What do you think will be your ability for production next year? And what do you think your level of sales? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 419.70-424.46: I assume you want to build some inventory, but what could be your maximum production or maximum sales next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 428.01-431.01: Okay, how you doing? Ricardo Arama speaking now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.29-440.36: So, about production, as a total production decision that we are ramped up to 180 during next year, we think it's reasonable to expect a production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 440.64-442.86: The 140,000 metric tonne 6 here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 443.62-453.41: Maybe it's going to be just a little bit higher than that, but 140 is my best estimate today of the total lithium and lithium hydroxide total production in Chile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 453.93-456.26: About sales volumes, Paulo, what's your opinion? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 457.22-458.58: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 459.10-462.84: Well, our idea is to continue growing according to the demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 463.54-471.77: If we consider that we expect a growth for the next year of the demand between 20 or 30%, we expect to grow our sales in that same percentage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 475.84-479.58: Okay, now I appreciate your pricing guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 479.82-483.70: Now, you know, when I look at October Chilean customs data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 483.74-490.03: Your pricing in October seems well less than $12,000. You're going to average above $12,000, you say, for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 490.47-500.10: So I want to know, you know, if you expect to play so much more volume next year and presumably you're now pricing volumes now for next year, like your pricing volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 500.18-501.28: Placing your head for next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 501.92-509.77: How much, you know, how much of your pricing, how much of your volume 2022 are you locking in now? Or we expect to lock in by Christmas, let's say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 510.41-516.62: And would you expect that pricing, that any pricing you're locking in now for 22, is that all of 12,000? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 525.65-530.55: Well, you know that today we are in the middle of the negotiation for polio for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 530.99-536.64: However, what I can say because you already know that we have to take use and local contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 537.20-546.55: But still for the next year we have, we need to negotiate closely to the 80% of our total sales for the next year is open to discussions with our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 546.93-551.03: So that's the percent that's in total volumes that is open for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 552.91-557.90: So right now today, 80% of your anticipated volume next year is open. Is that what you're saying? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 561.00-568.25: To. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 568.57-577.64: And 80% is still open to the conditions that we need to discuss with our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 579.70-588.71: And I appreciate that. And we can all see spot pricing from different Chinese and Asian benchmarks, be it $20,000 on carbon, $20,000 on junk, or $25,000 on carbon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 589.39-595.14: Are those real prices that you can achieve at scale in the market for 2022? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 595.26-601.42: Or is the answer, you know, it's much less than $25,000, but it's much more than $12,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 601.64-609.01: Like help us understand how real some of those prices are we see in the twenties for real volume, real large volume you offer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 612.39-621.84: You know that always is a noisy question regarding prices, but what we need to remember is that depending on what you negotiate with your customer, it means. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 621.86-624.60: Short-term contract, long-term contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 624.62-631.25: Depending on the quality of the product, if it goes to battery applications, industrial applications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 631.29-633.91: Then you have a different prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 634.37-642.46: What I prevent today is that because of the huge demand of lithium and lack of supply, the spot price is today high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.74-647.15: But it doesn't mean that we will see these kind of prices for the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 647.17-656.38: Price because again, it's depending on the conditions that we negotiate with each customer. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 662.34-666.33: Our next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 668.23-675.68: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope everyone is doing well. I'll ask a few questions one by one if that's okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 676.28-685.91: I guess the first question is just to extend off of Joel's question. You talked about 20% of 2022 volume is negotiated already and 80% is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.53-689.01: Can you just talk about the shape of that 80%? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 690.09-697.72: How much of that 80% should be contracted by the end of this year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 697.96-702.56: How do those contracts get renegotiated in each of the next kind of four or five quarters? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 703.92-713.09: You know, are they all calendar 2022 contracts that will be negotiated before January 1st or is it on a kind of continuous basis, summer short term, summer long term? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 713.41-719.34: Can you just give some more color in terms of when we expect that 80% to be contracted? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 723.68-728.63: Okay, well, it is a difficult question because we are under negotiation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 729.09-734.41: For sure that we know that when you are selling this amount of lithium, we need to secure that amount. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 734.89-737.86: But also it's up to every customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 738.10-744.56: The rest of the 80% will be a combination of closed shorted contracts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 744.58-752.19: And for sure, something that we are looking for, if we are able to sign good contracts, we are also thinking to sign non-sign contracts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 752.83-759.12: Normally, when you sign a lot of contracts, the negotiation process is longer than when you negotiate a shorter contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 759.14-763.60: So everything will depend on how fast we can do that with our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 763.80-769.87: So today I cannot really give you a number of how much of those contracts we will have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 770.05-780.00: Anyhow, we are very close to the end of the year, so for sure that I expect that by the end of the year, at least the first quarter should be already negotiating with our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 781.76-784.58: Will 100% be finished by the end of Q1? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 788.15-793.27: I cannot say 100%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 793.33-801.30: But most of it should be finished by the end of Q1. Is that right? I mean just based on the timing of the previous contracts and when they expire. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 801.50-802.92: Is that fair to say? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 806.41-808.31: But again, I mean, it depends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.43-813.13: But for sure, because of the period of the year that we have today,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 813.53-818.90: By the end of the year, we should have an important percentage that's already negotiated for Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 820.58-822.12: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 822.72-826.25: Next question is on iodine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 826.59-832.91: You guys have tried different strategies over the years, sometimes volume, sometimes price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.93-838.44: With mixed success on the price side and the volume side has been very successful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 838.82-844.28: Now we're getting above $35 or that's the direction that we're going per kilogram and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 844.64-853.73: If I remember correctly, that's kind of the point in which you start to see the economics look attractive for marginal producers in Chile to come online. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 854.13-861.02: Is that what you want? Do you want to see higher prices or is that getting a little bit dangerous that you could see new capacity coming on? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 861.04-865.05: Can you kind of run us through what that debate looks like and kind of what your opinion is? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 868.45-876.28: Okay, well, you know that in the industry we need to consider different things. So one of them is the demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.26-882.82: You know that this year the recovery of demand will be higher than expected, close to 12%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 883.72-886.51: Then we need to go see the answer of the supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 886.95-894.39: So at the end, everything will depend on the behavior of the different players in the supply side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 895.18-899.56: In that regard, what we have seen is not a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 899.58-907.97: I mean, we have not seen enough response of the supply in order to be able to supply all the demand that is today in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 909.35-912.65: So right now we start with the supply and demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 912.95-921.04: And everything will depend on how the different players react with the supply plans in order to accomplish the demand that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 924.40-929.89: Just two more quick ones for me. When you look at each of your business segments,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 930.41-937.30: Can you talk about costs of production, whether it's iodine or NLP or potash or whatever it may be? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 938.06-944.44: And how that's been impacted by inflation, cost inflation of raw materials, of labor, of energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.78-952.51: Are you seeing that already or is that something that we should expect and be modeling for over the next few quarters? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 956.52-959.00: If you review our numbers,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.06-967.29: During the first three quarters of this year, you see the cost is slightly higher during third quarter than compared to the previous quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 967.91-974.77: I think that course costs today are affected by the exchange rate, for example, the exchange. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 975.36-981.94: Are affected by increased cost of raw material, a significant increase in cost of raw materials on our production process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 982.46-984.94: The additional cost of the energy, as you may know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 985.53-992.71: Contractors, of course, the contractors we have, they reflect the exchange rate, increased cost of raw material, the energy, everything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.15-1000.84: We have to make sure that the cost in the last 18 months related to the COVID-19 pandemic that affects in some way our cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1001.26-1002.74: I think that's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1002.82-1003.98: It's already. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.14-1013.83: It will be some additional probably cost if the situation of the raw materials and energy continues during the next few quarters, yes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1014.39-1015.44: I think that we are doing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1015.48-1022.68: That the right thing in order to increase productivity, to increase the yields of our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1022.72-1032.09: But so far, we are seeing every single product producer in the world is increasing costs that have been affecting our production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1032.11-1034.75: Production in the last two or three quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.78-1045.65: Great. And then very last question, if I may. Last quarter, you said that lithium demand was looking like it was going to be up 40%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1045.67-1049.11: And next year was, you know, you were thinking of around 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.43-1053.69: Now you're saying lithium demand is going to be up 50% this year, and that makes sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1054.55-1063.00: The question is, is that 50% taking away some of the demand? Are we seeing some demand acceleration getting pulled from 2022? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1063.04-1066.87: Or do you think 2022 will still be 20 or potentially even stronger? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.69-1076.80: And then maybe as a follow up, how do you think 25 will look? Are we still looking like it'll exceed 1M tons or could it be a little bit higher? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.20-1085.43: Okay, Ben, first of all, we need to remember that it's important the base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.45-1093.57: For what we are starting 2020, we know that the demand was lower because of the crisis. So that explains why we have this big growth this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1094.13-1101.92: And we are going from 40 to 50% because what we have seen with electric vehicles sales, it's been very good and very positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1102.00-1109.77: Actually today our forecast is that the total sales, the year sales will be between 6.3 or 6.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.79-1112.87: Which is bigger than what one expected that's the thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1113.01-1121.34: And the other thing, because we need to consider that some part of the region that we demand today is for the cars that we produce next year, also we are... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1121.68-1129.15: We have a more positive view from the road of the next year when I said to you between 20 or 30%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1129.89-1133.13: That view is a little bit bigger than the view that we had before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1133.71-1137.56: So we have some very positive outcome, at least in the short term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1138.16-1141.80: We have different scenarios. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.88-1145.77: Our base scenario is 1 million, a toss of MCA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1146.05-1153.17: Which is bigger than the one we gave a month ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1154.31-1159.74: And we are working and of course we are following up the market and potentially we could see better results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1160.30-1166.83: But today we remain our view of the $1 million. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.23-1176.48: Our next question comes from Gwyhrein Poharni with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.04-1181.54: I don't want everyone to think of taking my questions. There are two questions, actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1182.00-1183.84: The first one on the Iodine business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.90-1192.41: If you could share a bit of the impacts of the fire that took place in one of your plants and what was the impact in terms of cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1192.75-1196.36: During this quarter and the second question on the fertilizer business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1196.80-1204.28: If you could share a bit in terms of the pricing that we are seeing on the marketplace and what do you expect going forward for the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1217.44-1218.98: Fire behind our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.00-1222.94: In the north three months ago, I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1223.92-1230.09: The impact in production was not more than 40 tons because most of the production was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.55-1237.86: And finally, about the cost, yes, we had some additional cost, probably in the range of $200,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1237.88-1239.74: Aright, man. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1240.00-1248.85: Improvement of the facility replacement of equipment, but in the $200,000 to $150,000 total. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1248.87-1250.59: Cost involving the fire. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1251.89-1253.57: That's why it was not so relevant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1254.05-1259.06: We are taking all the measures that this kind of situation will not happen again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.42-1265.45: It's a very important, it's a significant issue for us having a park in the facility. That's why we're... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.47-1270.53: We really tell the situation and now we're very prepared for this kind of situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1270.93-1280.00: About the fertilizer, it's difficult to give you an outlook after the fourth quarter. We know now that fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1280.50-1288.37: It is very unusual. We are observing price levels that have not been recorded in previous years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1289.91-1296.20: As I mentioned to you, we are reaching $700 per ton in the potash, close to $1,000 in the potash and nitrate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.14-1305.89: I do not have a long term view. It is important today to consider that in the potash industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.93-1314.87: The current prices that we have today reflect I think a temporary supply and demand situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.54-1321.34: One good news in my opinion is that the demand of the potash industry remains very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1322.32-1327.49: That is associated with better prices of agricultural products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1328.05-1333.41: On the other hand, these logistical difficulties of shipments push the prices up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1334.21-1340.72: It is very difficult for us to predict prices for next year. Definitely prices for fourth quarter are going to be very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.64-1345.65: The situation is very difficult to predict in the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1346.29-1352.03: Anyway, it's important to consider that the case of potassium nitrate is different from the case of potassium chloride. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1352.97-1361.96: All the specialty fertilizers are less volatile. However, although with less volatility, they follow in some way the trend of potash priming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1366.83-1374.11: Thank you, Mercury. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1374.15-1378.20: Our next question comes from Corinne Blanchard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1380.42-1381.58: Hey, good morning everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1382.34-1390.49: I'm not sure my question has been answered, but there's just a few, probably two follow-up questions. The first one on potassium. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1390.67-1397.20: So, you'll raise 2021 volume guidance to close to 900 kiloton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1397.78-1404.30: Which imply a significant catch-up in 4Q. So, if you could just comment on that catch-up for 4Q. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.64-1410.81: And also, how should we be thinking in terms of volume for 2022? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.17-1420.74: Given the market condition, do you still expect volume to decrease? And would you expect maybe volume to stay close to 800 or 900 or from next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1424.50-1433.13: So, in this case, we have a very good example of a very good example of a very good example. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.71-1439.18: Today, we are doing our best in order to increase the volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1439.20-1444.42: We are using some inventories and so on in order to increase the volume during the first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1444.80-1450.73: That's why probably if you put the numbers together, total volumes is close to 300,000 metric tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.87-1454.98: It's a very strong number. We expect to deliver during one quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1455.48-1460.00: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1460.34-1468.69: Sometimes you have a delay of one or two treatments from fourth quarter to first quarter. You don't know yet because it will be decided at the end of the month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1468.77-1470.73: Depending on the conditions of the port. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1471.59-1476.54: But anyway, it's going to be a really strong quarter because the price condition will try to push everything forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.92-1485.59: About next year, I don't have now a forecast of volume for that. Remember that we have a total production in the solar of the gamma. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.01-1494.43: And we use some of the potash, most of the potash in the production of Potassium Nitrate either for fertilizer or solar source business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.16-1501.14: That's why depending what's going to be able to study in especially fertilizer and solar source next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1501.72-1510.25: And the total production from the Solarzacama, at the end, the remaining is going to be the potage that will sell to the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1510.95-1518.50: Anyway, as you may know, we are reducing, it's our commitment from the company to reduce the pumping of solutions at the salary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.84-1523.08: The most important reduction will be in 2022 as compared to 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1523.50-1529.43: 23, 24, 25, we will have small reductions every year, but the most important one is going to be next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1529.85-1533.75: And from tools of production of voltage at this alarm,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1534.11-1545.15: Will be between 100 and 150,000 tons lower. It means from a total level close to 1.25 million tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.97-1549.73: We will move to 1.1 million tons probably production for next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1550.21-1557.20: If you move forward, probably reductions because the reduction in pumping will be in the range of 40,000 metric tons per year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1557.58-1560.00: The first year is an important one, the 150. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1561.18-1564.26: We don't know yet exactly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.13-1573.33: We're improving a lot the deals at the salon level, that's why we expect this to be closer to $100,000 with action. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1573.91-1580.36: Most of it, of course, will be reflected in the potash industry because our first priority is to supply the potash for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.62-1584.76: With nitrates and solar, but that's nitrate and solar source. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.99-1593.89: Great, thank you. And just to come back maybe a little bit on lithium pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1594.89-1601.40: What's your expectation going forward, maybe 22, but maybe even beyond that time? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.70-1610.85: In terms of considering maybe using a little bit of contract like short term, a little bit of long term and maybe switching to some sales on spot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1611.29-1620.26: Do you consider maybe switching at some point to a more hybrid model for pricing, like some of your peers are doing that? Or do you rather... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.28-1625.02: Know, stick more to contract and offtake agreements for most of the volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.13-1640.90: Okay, well, regarding to the expectation of prices for the next year, we see a strong demand, as we already said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1641.94-1648.27: However, you know that the price is an actor of the supply and demand, so everything also will depend on the reaction of the supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.37-1656.32: We know that there are other projects under development, so everything at the end will depend on how the supply can react to the demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1656.90-1666.63: Anyhow, we are really positive on the demand side, but we need to see what happens in the next year. But we should expect a positive trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1667.43-1672.77: We got into the strategy of contracts and mixtures, and it's something that we have said before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1673.39-1677.96: We are open to consider different alternatives with our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.32-1686.07: Our idea is to give our customers the solutions that they need. In the past we have announced some of their agreements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.45-1694.77: We are under discussions of different contracts with our customers, but at the end, what we are looking for always is to have good contracts for both sides. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.34-1701.20: So we are open finally to have a mixed strategy between short and long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1704.78-1713.63: Thank you, that's helpful. And then the last one, do you have any update on the construction or any update for the Mount Orland project in Australia? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.18-1726.13: Well, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we announced the final investment decision. So from there, we are doing a good progress. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1726.47-1735.48: We have started the early construction stage in both sides. That means the refinery in Quinana and the Mojola side where we'll be the mine and the concentrated plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.12-1741.42: So far so good according to the to the plan so everything is going well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1744.54-1756.70: Thank you. That's a good sign. Our last question today will come from Cesar Perez-Navoa with BTG Pactual. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1758.30-1761.82: Yes, good morning or good afternoon to everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1762.50-1768.35: Some of my questions have already been answered. Perhaps I have a weak connectivity here, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1769.05-1779.00: My questions would be what supply conditions does SQMC and the lithium market in general for next year considering that new volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1779.02-1783.60: Will come on stream for several producers including yourself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1784.38-1788.39: Second, I am fully aware management provides no pricing outlook. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1788.77-1798.74: However, most lithium benchmarks are hoovering around two times Ashkem's indicated fourth quarter price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.94-1800.00: The question being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.24-1812.27: In terms of direction, where would your realized price be or if that should come closer to that already embedded in the spot market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1812.61-1821.78: Considering that if I heard correctly, 80% of your contracts are yet to be closed, possibly in the first quarter of next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.22-1825.43: Any qualitative assessment there would be greatly appreciated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1835.66-1841.00: Hello? Okay, yeah. Okay, this is Pablo speaking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.30-1849.03: The market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.81-1857.68: As I told you, we see a growth for the next year between 20 and 30 percent and that is mainly explained for the electric vehicle penetration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1858.34-1866.95: As I said before, the potential SDPs for the year, we expect that they will be between 6.3 and 6.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.59-1874.45: For the next year we see that number will be close to 9 million, so we see that the amount of electric vehicles will continue growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1874.57-1880.08: So we are really positive about the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.50-1886.41: And we don't have any doubts about that. We see a strong fundamental of the lithium demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1888.15-1889.85: We go to the new supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.27-1895.34: Well, I think that it's good to see that new projects are coming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.54-1903.18: In the sense that in order to be able to supply this amount, this huge amount of demand, it's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.44-1910.15: So we expect that the important players will continue with the expansion plan that they also have announced, like us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1910.51-1912.69: So that's what we see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1913.43-1915.72: And finally, regarding to the prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1916.48-1920.32: It's really difficult to do so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.38-1924.26: Any forecast about that because you see that the market is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1924.28-1931.53: Is moving so fast, it changed so fast, that any price prediction I would say that it's difficult to do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1932.31-1940.36: What we're going to do is to try again to secure volumes with our customers, negotiating good conditions from each party. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1940.74-1944.16: In order to secure a long-term offer to our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1947.05-1951.13: All right, thank you very much. And if I may squeeze one more question there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1951.85-1957.66: Maybe you answered this before, but have you given any CAPEX guidance for 2022? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.02-1968.71: Yeah, so you find the wrong big topics for next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1968.87-1977.20: We did an update of the capex in the last 30 days, so 60 days, the same forecast we had at the beginning of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1977.64-1981.32: And if I'm not wrong, it's close to $500 million. It goes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1991.73-1994.23: All right, thank you, Ricardo. And thank you, everyone. Pablo, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.00-2009.79: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Irina Akhsenova, Investor Relations, for any closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2012.75-2016.78: Joining us today and we look forward to having you at our next call. Have a great day, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2019.38-2025.25: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2026.47-2032.45: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2034.01-2039.98: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.78-2047.45: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
