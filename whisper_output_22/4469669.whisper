asr:0: OUTPUT 434.71-436.22: Today's announcement is no different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.26-442.76: Toshiba has built a portfolio of leading businesses, but in order to enhance our competitive positioning,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 442.78-446.31: Each business needs greater flexibility to address. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 446.33-448.59: Its own market opportunities and challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 448.93-452.51: The official names for the new companies will be announced in due course.

asr:0: OUTPUT 538.48-545.45: The separation this time enables us to better align each new company by its unique business characteristics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 547.85-550.13: Infrastructure service company.

asr:0: OUTPUT 559.18-567.77: It has long business cycles that are more heavily dependent on negotiations between business parties than the market conditions at large. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 569.07-578.80: In addition, it will be a capital light business. And there are also major differences to the extent in which we conduct customized production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 579.26-585.55: In contrast, device company primarily manufactures and sells devices such as semiconductors and other materials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.57-590.75: Its business cycles are shorter and can be impacted significantly by the market conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 591.35-598.64: It will be a capital intensive business that requires scale of continuous production across multiple customer orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 599.38-605.63: And relatively speaking, the large capital investment needs to be made in a very flexible manner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 608.11-616.44: So objective of a spin-off, there are three reasons. First, the separation will unlock immense value by removing complexity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.50-625.61: Second, it enables us to have a much more focused and agile decision making and their management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 625.83-630.63: And the third, separation naturally enhances choices for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.03-639.86: Our board and management team firmly believe that the strategic reorganization is the right step for sustainable profitable growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 639.88-646.65: For each of the businesses and the best path to create additional value for our stakeholders.

asr:0: OUTPUT 660.22-668.91: We will be able to provide our customers more innovative and tailored services and solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 671.47-680.68: Our employees will have the opportunities to work at more focused companies where they can gain more technical expertise and self-growth opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.70-683.98: And have greater growth potential in their chosen field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 686.49-695.76: And the separation will benefit our communities by providing more focused solutions to solve social issues of carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 695.78-698.02: That we are all facing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 698.80-707.45: We believe that there are three main benefits of the business separation. First, the standalone companies will have improved management and governance structures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.25-714.49: Infrastructure service company and device company are expected to have dedicated management teams. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 714.51-719.18: That bring deep industry knowledge with clear growth strategies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 724.14-730.93: We will of course consider candidates from outside of the company for building new management structure.

asr:0: OUTPUT 740.64-745.69: With greater focus and knowledge of their respective companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.71-749.19: Customers and employees. In addition, new structure creates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 749.21-756.90: Optionality for both new companies to own their make on separate and informed decision regarding potential strategic partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 757.24-764.20: Second, the standalone companies will have more effective, efficient, and tailored capital allocation policies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 764.48-767.57: More closely matching their industry peers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 770.75-778.40: This will enable them to better explore options to optimize their cost of capital by managing their leverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.60-782.90: And provide more direct engagement with the capital markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 784.44-793.43: And increase the ability to target debt and equity investors, which could drive additional cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.52-800.72: And the third, and certainly not least, we will be able to increase shareholders' return. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 800.76-815.02: Toshiba intends to monetize shares in Kiyokusha while maximizing the shareholders' value and return the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practical possible to the extent that doing so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 815.03-818.44: Does not interfere with the smooth implementation of this separation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 819.76-829.43: This will increase the return to Toshiba shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.65-841.96: In addition, this will facilitate fair value by providing compelling investment opportunities that meet different preferences of the shareholders' investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 842.98-848.21: Soshiba has recently beat up a strong track record of creating a return to the value of the shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 849.09-859.26: Based on the targeted dividend payout ratio of 30% as committed over the last four years, we have steadily increased our dividend payment from 30 yen per share in FY 2018. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 859.28-862.40: To an expected 80 yen per share in FY21. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 862.98-871.05: In addition, the special dividend of 110 yen per share had already been provided during FY 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.65-876.72: Toshiba has also maintained a commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.88-884.30: We bought back 700 billion yen worth of the shares in 2010. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 884.42-888.75: And another 100 billion yen in 2021.

asr:0: OUTPUT 921.30-928.41: A strategic reorganization this time is the last step in Toshiba's commitment, latest step. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.43-932.13: In Toshiba's commitment to creating and returning shareholders' value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 935.76-952.29: In the spin-off, we are working with relevant authorities and advisors to determine the best and the most effective and efficient way to spin-off the businesses with an intention of effective transaction in a tax-qualified spin-off structure pursuant to the recent tax reform legislation in Japan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 952.85-956.78: We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 960.86-967.79: The timeline is that the reorganisation is expected to complete in the second half of the fiscal year 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 967.81-973.27: Subject to a shareholder's vote and in obtaining approval from the relevant authorities.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.06-1028.93: Now, over the past nearly five months or so, we have proactively evaluated a full range of options to enhance shareholders' value.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2821.06-2827.27: And compared to what we announced three months before it is an upward revision of a hundred billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2829.47-2832.37: For income before tax and net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2833.51-2842.22: As Kyokushiya's portion is unknown for the six months ahead. So this is just as a reference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2843.24-2850.25: In the first half, there was a $20 billion upward revision from Kiyoksia equity earnings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2851.73-2856.28: So we have made an upward revision for the income before tax and also net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2857.02-2862.42: For operating income and free cash flow, we maintain the previous forecast and there is no change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2863.10-2871.59: Slide 23 is a forecast by segment. At the very right column,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2873.45-2877.40: It gives the difference between the previous forecast announced three months before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.00-2883.56: A little lower than the middle device and storage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2883.58-2890.93: For the revenue, $80 billion upward revision for net sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2892.07-2901.04: However, having said that, out of this 80 billion, Keoxia memory resale is still included. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2901.08-2905.85: Which accounts for about half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2905.87-2912.53: So in real terms, semiconductor or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2912.55-2917.68: Hydride related growth increase in revenue is about 40 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2919.40-2922.44: And one column above, Retail and Printing Solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2924.64-2931.33: As Toshiba Tech already announced their figures,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2931.43-2940.76: And their overseas retail is very strong. Also with the weaker yen, we have made an upward revision of 20 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2941.00-2950.87: As they made this afforded provision, we also reflected the same. And as I mentioned, for the company-wide operating income, no change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2950.89-2954.93: By segment building solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2954.95-2963.26: Especially retail printing Toshiba Tech because of the soaring material and logistic costs lack of semiconductors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2963.82-2970.07: Each segment, compared to the previous announcement, made a downward revision by 5 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2970.71-2975.48: On the other hand, in the first half, device and storage has been very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2976.40-2981.82: So in net, it is a $15 billion increase in profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2982.94-2989.93: Slide 24. Similar to first half analysis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2989.97-3003.88: On the left is FY20, 104.4 billion operating profit and we had 17.5 billion restructuring cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3004.24-3010.11: So this is reversed, it will mean that we have an operating profit income of $120 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3011.05-3016.08: In addition to this, if you go a little to the right,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3017.96-3024.52: On a planned basis, we have the restructuring and 21 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3027.45-3029.31: Also... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3029.33-3038.44: Excuse me, restructuring cost of 10 billion and also fixed cost increase for 21 billion and half of that is depreciation and also half is for R&D. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3039.92-3046.65: With these expenses cost increasing, but with the increase in revenue,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3046.67-3050.73: And also with the effect of the restructuring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3050.75-3052.15: You. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3052.55-3059.58: Which will offset the increase of a cost and a 170 billion profit is achievable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3061.92-3069.99: Lack of semiconductor, and also the soaring material price, as I mentioned earlier, that is illustrated in the balloon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3071.45-3075.70: So that was about the second quarter results explanation. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3080.00-3085.49: That concludes the presentation part of the session. Now we'd like to move on to the Q&A session.

asr:0: OUTPUT 3179.38-3181.42: Thank you very much for the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3182.10-3187.47: First off, now regarding the separation into three entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3188.13-3196.46: What are the flows of discussion that resulted in this conclusion? Well, for the SRC and the Board of Directors,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3197.00-3199.16: I think that discussion was all ongoing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3199.38-3204.58: The Fu first came up with the idea of separation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3204.60-3210.05: What type of other choices that we have discussed other than the separation of the entities? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3213.53-3216.76: Now, this is Tsunakaba. May I answer to your question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3218.62-3224.68: Now, as I mentioned earlier, executive side and also the board meeting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3224.84-3228.93: Have had the meetings almost every week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3229.19-3230.71: For the last five months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3230.93-3233.33: There were many strategic options that we discussed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3233.57-3238.62: And also that were reviews of the medium-term plan that we have compiled and also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3238.94-3240.84: We. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3241.02-3250.13: We at the SRC had had a discussion about the potential privatization with our partners. So we have compared many options. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3250.55-3254.03: Now, in regards to the ideas of tax-free,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3254.19-3263.74: While we were discussing and after the end of the discussion between HRC and the board, we came up with this idea. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3264.20-3269.65: And as PowerPoint had mentioned, the executive CMO management side have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.67-3275.46: Had a very confident in pursuing this option of a tax-free spin-off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3275.68-3281.40: I believe that this is the best possible path forward for Toshiba. That is all. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3282.66-3288.33: Are there any other options that we have discussed? Could you elaborate on that? Could you repeat the question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3290.03-3298.60: So when the spin-off idea surfaced and SRC or the same measurement, who was the first one to say? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3298.88-3300.84: And were there any other options? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3302.56-3309.93: Regarding other options, SRC will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3309.95-3316.48: Issue a report at a later date about how the discussion has developed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3316.62-3321.68: It was about 10 pages long, a document that we intend to publish in due course. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3322.08-3331.59: But it was several months ago that this particular idea surfaced. And SRC, we at the management and advisors,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3332.69-3335.38: All parties involved and made a discussion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3335.44-3337.12: In the course of the whole discussion,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3338.14-3348.31: We came up with the idea of a tax-free spin-off and the feasibility of that idea was recognized as a viable option and ultimately. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3348.63-3356.10: We came up with the idea of separation into three companies and ExiftiveSide had proposed this idea. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3356.42-3360.28: May I move on to the second question then? Second question is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3363.24-3365.03: Now, regarding the future growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3365.27-3375.18: Now, spin-off is just talking about the institution. It is means, but how are you going to make growth in real-term basis that I'd like to explore with you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3376.80-3379.84: Reason is that in regard to the Toshiba Next Plan,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3379.98-3389.07: In FY25, 43 yen of the net sales and 400 billion yen of operating income and 10% of operating income margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3389.47-3393.51: That was the target and a total of the three entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.71-3400.36: Will you be able to exceed that initial target in the case of Dochin Ichiba? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3400.92-3405.11: The source of growth is coming from the technology developed by R&D. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3405.51-3411.49: And what is the source of the development and how are you gonna separate that into three entities? Could you label it on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3412.25-3421.40: I think answer is that the question is to talk about the growth potential and as page 8 describes, there are three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3421.42-3424.12: Rectangles and from left and right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3424.14-3425.85: Realty speaking,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3425.87-3434.75: That these are considered shareholders where we are changing the entity structures and simplify the operation so that we can materialize the values. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3435.50-3443.10: And thereby providing more options for the shareholders. But in regard to the growth, the square in the middle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3444.04-3452.17: Where the forecast and agile management, that will be the largest difference vis-a-vis other ideas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3452.45-3454.39: To give you some specific ideas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3454.69-3457.66: And for example, as Mr. Hatazawa mentioned earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3457.68-3464.78: The power semiconductor to be growth and then the investment into 300 millimeter was made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3465.11-3472.25: And that is something that I reflect upon now, that semiconductor is in shortages nowadays, and in retrospect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3474.09-3477.34: Probably a year before our decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3477.36-3488.67: Or at least six months before our actual decision that investment had had to be made, but there were headquarters and the subsidiaries and there are the topic safety meetings and others and therefore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3488.69-3493.69: It took quite a long time to make final decisions and in terms of agility,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3493.75-3495.90: They are something that we are personally focused upon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3496.22-3497.34: And therefore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3497.36-3504.40: Looking at each market, the competition situation and peers or competitive landscape that we need to carefully. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3504.46-3508.95: Look at and the focus and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3508.97-3515.40: The very small management will have to make very agile decisions so that we can compete well in the global market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3515.48-3518.28: So that's why we decided to separate the entities in this way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3518.42-3519.78: I personally believe that's a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3520.26-3524.90: And in regard to Toshiba's next plan, how the number will play out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3525.13-3532.21: In regard to the specific targeted numbers when we discussed with shareholders as SRC has mentioned earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3532.39-3537.14: That Toshiba always make the three-year medium term plan in the year three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3537.36-3545.75: So Shibahara never had achieved the results and the target. And that was actually a criticism that we have to face up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3546.19-3554.93: And we are thinking about the feasible number and we incorporate that into this presentation. I just wanted to add that to my comments. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3555.52-3557.74: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3560.00-3564.68: As explained by Mr. Matsunaka earlier regarding the statement by the board,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3567.77-3575.98: Has been already released on our press release web page titled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3576.84-3581.86: The process is reading to the spin-off plan by the board of directors of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3582.58-3585.17: And that is already released on our website. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3586.77-3596.10: Mr. Furukawa, Ms. Furukawa, this is Furukawa of Bloomberg speaking. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3596.50-3601.72: I have two questions. May I ask two questions at once? Yes, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3602.78-3607.15: I have questions to Tsunakawa-san regarding this reorganization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3607.79-3621.10: I understood advantages very well but changing the organisation of the company there will be risks incurred and potential demerits as well and in reorganisation process in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3621.96-3628.43: I think that you were going to explain this to employees and other stakeholders like business partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3628.49-3632.23: Do you think that all stakeholders will understand this and accept this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3632.49-3638.60: And a second point is about the conversion of the stake in Keoxia into cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3639.64-3647.83: The shares will be partly purchased and most of the net proceeds will be returned to the shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3648.25-3654.57: And this time are you going to divest all the shares held by the company and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3654.59-3658.70: Could you please explain whether the plan stays unchanged and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3659.24-3662.20: And IPO policy related to QXEA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3662.36-3669.49: Do you still keep the strategy or policy to keep the Kyoksia IPO? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3670.63-3678.54: And regarding merits and demerits, in the competitive landscape, there are advantages regarding the creative capabilities of Toshiba. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3678.82-3686.89: As in the question asked by the reporter from Nikkei, I couldn't respond to that. Regarding the research laboratories,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3687.35-3689.67: Were there any concerns about that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3691.17-3695.86: He asked that question as well. And researchers and staffers in principle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3697.18-3701.46: Are going to be divided into two companies, standalone companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3701.90-3707.67: There needs to be a system of process allowing the exhibition of creativities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3708.09-3716.46: And we would like to work out the details related to the basic research at the research laboratories. And that is the remaining challenge for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3716.96-3718.14: We have to work on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3718.52-3725.87: But in principle, staffers will be divided into two stand-alone companies to promote the individual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3725.89-3735.60: Companies, semiconductor energy and infrastructure, the core weight of the management strategy will be changed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3736.12-3741.52: But we believe that the disadvantage will outweigh disadvantages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3741.86-3743.84: And as you said that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3743.86-3751.97: We would like to come up with a system to improve the situation related to any potential disadvantages in your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3752.05-3759.62: Regarding your second question about Kyoksia, whatever which will exceed the appropriate level of capital will be returned to shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3760.00-3770.47: And earlier majority of stake, the net seeds proceeds from the sale of the Kyoksha shares will be returned to shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3770.49-3774.01: And considering the current financial position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3775.62-3785.61: Everything in excess of the appropriate capital. Well we thought that even if when we return all the proceeds from the sale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3785.65-3791.07: To shareholders, we would be able to sustain the financial structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3791.85-3801.10: So this time we said that all the proceeds will be returned to shareholders. Of course, anything related to the spin-off will be kept. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3801.54-3805.35: By IPO's policy which stays unchanged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3805.75-3812.35: And this is to be determined by Bain, therefore this is not something we are able to determine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3812.57-3818.86: But following the decision by Bain, we like to be cooperative with them so that we can be prepared. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3822.86-3827.29: Thank you. Next, NHK, Shimae-san, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3830.35-3834.03: This is Shmaee from NHK. Do you hear me okay? Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3838.02-3840.00: I would like to ask Tanaka-san. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3842.72-3844.16: Is about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3844.28-3850.89: Disadvantage of the separation plant and there was a mention about the R&D. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3852.35-3857.10: So 3 trillion yen sells size by splitting that, separating that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3857.42-3865.02: So size wise it will be smaller first of all, but still do you believe that you will be viable with a smaller size? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3865.41-3871.67: And also I would like to ask Mr. Broff is that privatization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3871.69-3877.98: Has been often mentioned and this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3878.00-3880.78: So the three entities being listed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3881.40-3884.64: So that is quite the contrary with privatization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3885.73-3895.34: So have you given up with the privatization? And if you have given up with the privatization, so what was the reason and the cause? So can I hear from? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3897.26-3906.93: So first Mr. Sunakawa will respond and then we will be switching the image camera and also the voice to connect to Mr. Brough. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3907.35-3914.25: So the question was about three troglodynes being split and separated, whether we are concerned about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3915.94-3917.62: For energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3917.64-3927.45: Energy infrastructure business, 2 trillion. Worth of business in size and semiconductor device storage, 1 trillion. A little less than 1 trillion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3931.01-3936.80: So this is sizable, quite sized, and we are aiming for a fresh start. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3937.72-3939.02: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3939.04-3948.25: So we are willing to start a very fresh start with a financial position. So we do not have any concerns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3948.51-3949.55: On the other hand,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3949.59-3956.78: The two entities will be able to have a very agile management in their business on a very focused manner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3956.80-3960.84: That is a large advantage. So I think I will switch to Mr. Broff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3961.82-3965.27: Switching the image and also the voice. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3968.69-3977.50: Thank you, Chairman. As Chairman Sunakawa has mentioned, we have uploaded this afternoon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3977.70-3984.20: The SRC's 10-page letter which I think is probably unprecedented. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3984.22-3990.29: Explaining the journey that the SRC as well as the board. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3990.31-3992.81: Has been through for the last five months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3993.43-4000.64: And within that letter, you will see a section related to the potential privatization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4000.66-4004.56: Of Toshiba and all of the work that we did. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4004.58-4007.33: On that particular option. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4008.25-4015.24: But what we ultimately decided was that the plan that we presented today, the separation plan,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4015.26-4025.29: Offered more flexibility to our shareholders and was in fact better as far as the long-term growth and value of Tsushima Corporation was concerned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4025.95-4029.95: So we believe the plan is the best for our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4031.19-4039.40: When we began the SRC exercise, there was a view expressed by some shareholders, but not all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4039.42-4042.34: That we should be going straight to an auction process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4042.54-4052.13: Frankly, our fiduciary duties require us to explore all options and through that process the separation plan was developed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4052.69-4060.00: The reason for the separation plan is actually explained in the letter and it arose from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4075.72-4078.62: The SNRC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4080.12-4081.80: It is in the report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4082.10-4091.89: But SRC with the strategic partners in a very deep manner, first stage, second stage, third stage, and many layers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4092.21-4094.89: There was discussion and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4096.70-4102.90: Each partner, for example, regulatory risk, also about the antitrust, also Kyivskaya. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4104.66-4110.97: That the price is difficult and unclear and we did not come to a very clear-cut pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4111.49-4118.06: And that is also mentioned in the report. So I hope that you will read through the report. That is all for myself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4121.26-4128.35: Did you say that with the partners you already had discussion about the general shareholder meeting? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4132.15-4134.77: Do you believe that it will be approved at the AGM? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4138.30-4144.42: Right, in the disclosure in the announcement between January and March,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4145.09-4151.31: About the separation plan into three entities, we are confident in what we have announced and explained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4151.55-4165.29: And we are asking for the endorsement and to seek opinions from the shareholders we are expecting to hold EGM during January-March. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4167.63-4170.67: Next, Murakami-san of Asahi Shimbun, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4171.77-4175.08: This is Murakami of the Asahi Shimbun. Can you all hear me? Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4176.18-4182.64: Thank you for the opportunity. May I ask a question to Mr. Tanakawa? Separation into three entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4183.16-4185.27: Well, when we look at it from a different point of view,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4185.55-4195.54: General comprehensive electric company, that idea has already been given up on and then this is a disbundlement of the companies. What do you think of this opinion? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4196.10-4200.72: Well, let me answer that being a comprehensive electronic company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4200.90-4207.33: Be it a TV, a personal computer, and home appliances, and a medical that I used to belong to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4207.81-4210.05: There's nothing of the business already. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4210.45-4216.86: And therefore, we are no longer comprehensive electronic player. However, social infrastructure and device business in semiconductors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4217.20-4218.64: These two entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4219.00-4223.12: You mentioned that this is a disbundlement, but in my opinion, this is an evolution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4223.14-4231.61: For the future. So it is not dismantlement, but it is evolution for the future. So we would like to be very confident in moving forward to the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4232.05-4234.21: May I ask second question, if I may? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4234.75-4243.08: Now, the reorganization plan this time, what is the impact of the employment as well as the closure of your operating sites? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4245.49-4251.95: Impact on the employment, I would not expect so, but that also requires. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4251.97-4255.92: Further explanation to the society at large. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4256.14-4261.52: So that's the policy that we'd like to take going forward in regard to the closure of the operating sites. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4265.43-4266.73: The pen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4266.75-4276.50: Does not complete with the announcement of the plan. Announcement of the plan is the starting point for the future evolution. This is the starting point for further development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4276.64-4283.84: And therefore, we will continue with the portfolio review, capital allocation policies, and we are poised to do that going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4284.06-4285.67: On top of that, if necessary,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4285.83-4287.99: There's nothing be decided at this point in time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4288.05-4295.48: But we may conclude that perhaps the closure of the site is more rational, but we have started. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4295.50-4298.08: Our path toward evolution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4298.36-4303.48: And therefore, in the Minister of our course of actions, there will be other opportunities as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4303.86-4305.25: Last question if I may. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4305.51-4309.11: The Governance Enhancement Committee report that I'd like to ask about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4309.21-4318.40: In that report, the former senior executive officers have engaged in acts in violation of the corporate ethics. And based on that,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4318.42-4324.28: Well, although the duty was already relieved from the former executives,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4324.40-4335.78: And still you are asking for them to pay back their remuneration and also some damages are loathed to be made. What do you think of that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4336.34-4345.06: Well, first, the reason of the report was compiled that perhaps induced by the independent investigative report that perhaps the AGMM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4345.17-4353.99: Organized in a fair manner, such as interfering with the voting activities of the shareholders and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4354.05-4362.46: We as a company committed to the receipt of the independent investigative report in the various years since the Siamana. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4362.62-4367.91: And it is not the legal decision whether that was acceptable or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4368.33-4377.62: It is just a fact that we received the report from investigators and also some of the board's threats were resisted by the shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4377.88-4382.82: We believe that the pressure issue was the covenants issue of this company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4382.88-4391.95: That is awareness. So it wasn't about what had happened in the past. It was about the evolutions for the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4392.41-4399.98: And without having the redevelopment of the governance structure of this company, the sustain of plan will not be executed quite well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4400.20-4408.55: And therefore, as soon as possible, we would like to reorganize or redevelop the governance structure of this company and the full report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4408.91-4420.46: Of the Governance Enhancement Committee was now published and I look at the fourth quarter regarding the suggestions to the recurrence prevention measures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4420.50-4424.58: And there were four major points were raised. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4424.84-4429.37: And how we are going to rebuild the governance of this company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4429.85-4435.48: How are we going to rebuild the governance? That I'd like to highlight in my expertise going forward in the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4436.10-4441.96: I do not intend to just reflect upon what had happened in the past. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4442.34-4446.17: We just make a very sincere reflection about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4446.27-4453.95: And it's always the case that the company will say that we thought something bad had happened and we will change going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4454.19-4455.68: That's not what we are going to do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4455.84-4462.58: We will do a serious exercise such as brainstorming and discussions and we would like to be very strenuous. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4462.60-4470.17: Implementing the recurrence prevention measures and I'd like to spend a lot of time for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4471.19-4479.48: Are you suggesting that what had happened has a bygone? So bygones be bygone and you are going to focus on more forward-looking actions going forward. Is that a case? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4481.26-4490.19: Well, compensation committee, as Ms. Wadahiki mentioned,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4490.25-4500.32: Perhaps a competition committee may discuss something about what had happened in the past, but personally, I'd like to just count on the competition committee for the decisions to come in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4500.50-4501.62: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4503.06-4507.85: From Kyodo News, Ms. Inoue, please have the floor. Yes, this is Inoue of Kyodo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4508.71-4513.25: I have a question to Mr. Tsunakawa regarding this decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4517.10-4519.32: The process leading to this decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4520.04-4524.96: The composition of the board has been reduced from 13 by 5 members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4525.59-4534.01: And Tanaka-san, you are serving as the president as well and on the board as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4534.45-4541.78: I wonder how this decision was reached. So could you please give us your take on this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4542.30-4548.25: Yes, chairperson of the board is served as a temporary position and also for the president position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4548.65-4556.08: We needed to find a successor as soon as possible. Of course, the successor plan is being formed by any companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4556.56-4563.24: So anyway, this is something that should be determined by the nomination committee. So I will follow the decision by the committee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4563.54-4571.55: But for the current position and the duties and responsibilities I would like to dedicate myself to fulfil these duties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4572.41-4578.92: So do you have the idea that you are going to continue to serve in order to accomplish this spin-off? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4580.76-4585.37: Well, at the board, the current board serving, well, I think that the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4585.39-4591.35: By when I'm going to serve on the board, this is to be determined by the nomination committee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4591.57-4596.84: But as far as we have this plan for the spin-off, I would like to continue to dedicate myself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4598.52-4600.78: And Mr. Krumatomy resigned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4603.36-4616.84: And he was engaged in saying that he will respect the engagement with shareholders and I think that do you think that if there was no influence by the activists. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4616.86-4618.78: Do you think that you didn't? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4618.90-4621.26: You had been reaching this decision this time around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4621.90-4624.38: Well, when you say activists. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4624.40-4632.65: In this process we could learn a lot from the engagement with shareholders, particularly in relation to governance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4632.85-4635.34: There are many things that we could learn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4637.06-4640.70: Irrespective of whether or not shareholders are activists or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4640.76-4650.21: But this time, in order to enhance the value of the company and to enhance the shareholders' value, we believe that this was the right decision three years ago in 2018. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4650.29-4652.45: Toshiba Next Plan was formulated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4652.95-4659.06: And at the time, the company's goal was to, through maximization of corporate value,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4659.26-4663.38: TSO total shareholder return is to be enhanced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4663.74-4670.13: This is what we said. So TSR or shareholder's value to be maximized. That was what we said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4671.29-4674.81: And this policy has not changed at all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4675.28-4679.66: And this time for the purpose of increasing the shareholder value or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4679.70-4681.34: Expanding the CSR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4681.38-4684.92: And this separation plan is very reasonable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4684.94-4692.99: Towards the future, we need to make evolution. We believe that this is a very important one step towards that. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4695.08-4697.16: From Diamond, Stenbogesund, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4699.10-4701.22: From Diamond, my name is Simpunky speaking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4701.64-4710.15: On a related note, I would like to ask about the top management positions and I do have several questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4711.83-4719.66: Within the year to find a successor and also the chair of the board meeting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4720.58-4729.85: And I understand that it will be difficult to find a successor within the calendar year. I would like to know whether that is correct and also what the reason. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4730.81-4737.26: And perhaps Mr. Brough from the nomination committee or anyone who is suitable to answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4737.60-4743.40: I hope that would be answered. And also my next question is about the separation plan into three entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4744.34-4752.59: About the President, CEO, and would that impact the finding the successor of the chairman and also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4755.78-4758.82: When do you want to decide on the new management? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4761.82-4771.73: So at the first question, we would like to ask Mr. Bofton. And please wait as we will be switching the image and also the line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4775.38-4779.24: With regard to the separation plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4780.00-4787.91: We should be able to recruit and retain people with more specialist skills. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4788.49-4792.13: Rather than the generalist skills that are needed to run a conglomerate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4792.97-4797.64: And once we have the support of our shareholders,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4797.66-4804.48: We will be on a course to start recruiting people for our respective boards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4804.74-4809.35: But that's a little bit early in the day at the moment but of course the intention is to have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4809.37-4815.74: Appropriately qualified boards with industry experience to run those two Stinco businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4817.70-4824.26: I think beyond that, we are going to go to our shareholders for an EGM in March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4825.09-4828.51: I think once we've got that endorsement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4828.53-4836.34: We should be putting forward some more candidates for Toshiba Corporation 6502 to assist the board. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4836.38-4839.44: In particular with regard to the Orbit Committee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4860.00-4862.76: And the translator mistakenly announced that it was me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4866.91-4873.65: About the outside board directors deciding by December that plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4873.67-4877.18: And there was a question on that point and the reason. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4878.62-4886.89: So this time, this much strategic options and we had this change in course and within the process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4888.57-4898.56: Unless it was fixed and as we were not able to recruit and appoint someone. So that was what was mentioned at the nomination committee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4898.58-4900.32: I am not a member of the nomination committee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4900.68-4909.55: So the first priority was placed on to creating and specify the separation plan. That was the priority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4911.91-4913.95: That was the supplementary explanation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4918.28-4920.46: We will move to the next question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4922.20-4924.78: Next, Takahashi-san of Toyo Keizai, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4926.11-4933.13: Can you hear me? Yes, hear you well. This is Takahashi of Toyo Kids. I thank you very much for this opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4933.35-4938.46: I'd like to follow up the previous question. May I ask once again and confirm? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4939.02-4947.97: Now, the chairperson of the company, for your company, what is the selection process? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4948.77-4957.50: Well, the question is that, Sunaka-san, are you going to serve as an interim chairperson until the separation of the companies? May I confirm once again? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4957.96-4963.44: And I'd like to ask another question at this juncture. That the company will be separated into three entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4963.96-4969.09: And the third one, which is considered to be the current Toshiba portion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4969.37-4979.30: That the Kiyok shares stake will be owned and also Toshiba Tech shareholder is going to be Toshiba, but do you think that Toshiba will disappear in the future? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4979.40-4984.14: I just wonder what is the continuation or existence of the Shiba entity going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4984.60-4990.75: Regarding who will be the chairperson and CEO in the future regarding that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4990.77-4998.12: Outside directors are comprising the nomination committee so it is up to the nomination committee's decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4998.36-5005.67: So at this point in time, there's nothing that we know of. And therefore, it is up to the nomination committees to discuss going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5006.09-5013.15: Now regarding what would happen that the legacy Toshiba, what would happen on that entity? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5013.49-5020.92: Will of Toshiba will own the ownership stake of Kyokusha and for Kyokusha's ownership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5021.16-5024.38: We would like to monetize into the cash as soon as possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5024.86-5028.23: And for Toshiba Tech, positioning is completely different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5029.63-5037.50: Well, Kiyokusha is an equity method applicable company and Toshiba Tech is a fully consolidated listed subsidiary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5042.00-5046.25: What we call data business. For that, there's nothing decided at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5047.19-5048.67: Working on digitalization at the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5048.75-5057.44: Business and Toshiba Tech owns many data and Toshiba Tech's business is indispensable for Toshiba overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5057.66-5066.99: So what would happen for that entity? Currently there are the heavy debt and also brand management issue as well. We need to discuss about the details going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5067.39-5069.21: So that is the current situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5071.01-5075.92: Thank you. Now, do you have clear pathways for divestitures and so forth? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5076.24-5083.32: No, none. Are you asking about tech? Correct. The tech for the Toshiba Tech, nothing is decided. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5085.05-5088.31: May I ask a further question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5089.25-5095.22: Relationship of the three entities. Once these are spun off, and it will be different independent entities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5095.52-5102.94: I'm not sure it is legally allowable or not. However, for example, cross-holding the shares, for example, among the three entities would that be a viable option? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5104.52-5109.17: Under the laws and regulations in Japan, cross-shareholding of three entities is impossible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5109.47-5116.30: So we will not have a cross-sharing of the shares. Thank you very much. Next is TV Tokyo. Abe-san, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5118.86-5122.64: This is Abe of TV Tokyo. Can you hear me? Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5125.91-5135.74: In this press conference, the materials are titled, The Transforming Toshiba to Enhance Shareholder Value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5138.40-5146.75: And it used to be to enhance corporate value, but it has been changed to enhance shareholder value. Is it correct? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5147.89-5150.29: I don't know. I'm not sure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5151.03-5160.54: The shareholder value should be enhanced. That was the word we finalized. And by maximizing corporate value and then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5160.56-5163.22: Shareholder value will be also enhanced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5163.80-5167.55: So, in the end, ultimately, shareholder value will be enhanced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5167.93-5173.49: As the means to do that and then corporate value should be increased so TSR should be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5173.51-5179.30: Expanded. So as the final point to reach we wrote the shareholder value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5180.68-5188.57: The reason why I ask this question, according to what I heard from the company's people and the current management team,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5189.51-5194.61: Maybe people are looking only towards the shareholders within the management team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5194.83-5200.16: And that is the criticism that we have heard from the people in the company, activists, particularly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5200.78-5204.34: In particular, shareholders are a considered must. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5204.54-5213.97: In preparation of this material, Tanakawa-san, you mentioned that there are a lot of discussions, management team and the top executives of the subsidiaries and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5214.51-5216.88: So have you... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5216.90-5225.01: I believe that there was only limited discussion with the top executives of the subsidiaries or operating companies and it was out of the blue for them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5225.37-5230.15: Do you think that you have obtained understanding from the internal people about this plan? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5233.53-5235.96: We have been continuing to say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5235.98-5244.72: Since three years ago when Toshiba Next Plan was announced and TSL should be enhanced, we have been keeping to say the same thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5244.82-5247.09: But of course, shareholders, stakeholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5247.35-5250.71: But of course, the society at large and employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5251.33-5261.06: All the stakeholders should be valued. And this is our policy which has stayed unchanged. And this time again, we do not change this policy at all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5261.56-5264.72: By having this separation into three companies,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5264.76-5272.33: We believe that we will be able to provide appropriate services to customers and there will be incentives and various benefits and benefits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5272.35-5274.07: Merit for employees as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5274.33-5278.52: Based upon the business cycle of each company after separation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5278.66-5286.33: And overall, for all the stakeholders, we believe that this decision is going to be the best option. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5290.89-5298.32: Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone companies which will be listed on the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5299.20-5305.81: Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage of the shares to be allocated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5306.01-5309.67: Do you think that this will be reflecting the current values? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5311.89-5318.34: Well, I think that will be determined when the spin-off is completed. We do not have anything that has been clarified. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5318.92-5320.66: Nothing clarified? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5321.26-5323.80: Then the structure of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5323.82-5332.27: Shareholding ownership structure is different. I think there will be an option for shareholders to choose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5333.07-5338.24: Well, based upon the same ratio, I think maybe I should defer this question to CFO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5341.00-5349.35: So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5351.09-5357.62: Will be divided, I mean shares of the Toshiba held by shareholders will be divided. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5357.68-5364.44: And shareholders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5364.80-5370.97: So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5374.11-5376.26: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5376.42-5385.93: I think there is uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D functions. For example, in the case of infrastructure company,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5385.95-5389.99: Infrastructure, business, and the QKD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5390.01-5392.89: Business, of course, quantum encryption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5393.53-5397.08: It will cost a lot of money in R&D activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5398.30-5404.76: So after separating into two entities and research laboratories will be also divided into two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5405.15-5413.79: So do you think that you can you'll be able to maintain such capabilities that Toshiba cutting edge technology can be really maintained? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5414.43-5421.64: I think there needs to be more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5425.05-5427.27: Okay, I would like to defer to Hatta Zawa-san. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5428.05-5436.14: Within the numbers we presented, CAPEX R&D expenditures are explained for the coming three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5438.12-5440.00: And according to the current plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5440.70-5449.63: The growth plan to be supported by the growth funds as you know to be spent in the R&D and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5450.73-5455.56: So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5456.06-5458.60: R&D expenditures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5459.22-5463.56: In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5463.64-5471.53: Which has been increased by 1% or 2% a point. So overall, we are going to put more focus on the R&D. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5473.47-5478.92: And in terms of division into device and infrastructure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5478.94-5481.38: And content-sensitive research. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5481.58-5491.07: It will depend on where in the business areas such activities can be allocated to and then the expenditures or efforts will be divided. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5491.19-5500.94: As Tanaka-san mentioned, and the basic research, we would like to avoid a negative impact of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process of spin-off completion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5501.26-5511.23: R&D continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to be even more aggressive in spending in the R&D. Lastly,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5511.67-5518.38: Have you already reported this plan to METI? If so, what was the feedback? What was the reaction from METI? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5520.96-5530.25: Yes, we went to explain this to them in advance. I don't think there was any negative feedback from them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5530.99-5539.30: Thank you very much. So it is about time so we would like to take the last question. UK Business. Could I have the phone please? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5541.68-5550.15: This is Kodachi from Nikkei Business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last questions. Two to Tsunakawa-san. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5550.99-5552.35: So by the kilts and chairs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5553.45-5560.30: So in order to solve the excessive net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5562.26-5564.12: So we have the device company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5565.47-5570.85: So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5571.13-5574.55: And if you keep the shares in stake, perhaps you can see some energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5574.91-5581.34: So, but are you still willing to determine to sell the stake? And the second one is about the separation plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5582.24-5586.99: So I think this special resolution will be required at the AGM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5587.45-5592.93: But I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be a very hard hurdle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5610.21-5620.20: And also, I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5622.52-5623.76: Is that is what I heard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5625.51-5634.83: Within the SRC, so why not sell to the PE fund but this separation plan was supported. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5635.20-5643.76: So, could you reiterate the reason? Because I did not find in the explanation the reasoning. So, could that be answered? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5644.58-5648.45: So myself, Tanaka, about these Keoksea Steak shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5649.41-5652.29: So why not seek synergy with the semiconductor business? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5653.23-5656.74: Memory business will require massive investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5656.76-5663.96: And even with the current financial position, we have decided no longer to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5663.98-5667.63: And so instead to monetize the stake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5667.75-5672.59: So that has been already decided from before and there is no change to this policy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5673.03-5678.86: And about the two-third special resolution 2023. So until that point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5681.68-5683.10: As I mentioned earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5683.92-5690.99: This reform is just the beginning and it is sort of a declaration and so in the meantime. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5691.83-5700.30: There will be further reform that is going to come and will be executed also capital policy as well and also for the shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5700.94-5704.24: That we will be endorsed and be supported, we will make the effort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5706.79-5709.45: And Mr. Brough, could you respond please? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5710.49-5715.66: The SRC's letter to shareholders, which was published this afternoon,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5715.68-5721.14: Goes into some detail about the process we followed with regard to private equity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5721.70-5727.99: It was quite an exhaustive process, going through several rounds with credible buyers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5728.09-5733.81: And at the end of the day, the separation plan came about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5733.87-5739.72: Principally because of the difficulty in valuing the Keoxius shares at this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5740.10-5760.08: And the separation plan was therefore regarded as superior to the private equity plan from a quantitative and qualitative aspect. So if you like, the separation plan emerged from our earlier discussions with regard to the management plan,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5760.10-5762.20: To possible minority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5762.28-5763.28: Investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5763.34-5766.59: With regard to private equity solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5780.00-5782.22: Other sessions for the media. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5785.19-5792.79: Next we would like to invite the SOSAT analysts and financial institutions to take up some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5793.09-5799.26: So those of you who were not picked up by the questionnaire, please retract your questions by pressing Asterix 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5799.70-5808.43: Now we would like to open the session for the analysts and the investors and please enter your question by pressing asterisks and one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5809.31-5817.08: City group, Ezawa-san, please. This is Ezawa of city group. Can you all hear me? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5817.72-5820.16: Thank you very much. Two questions at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5822.84-5826.93: Until recently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5826.95-5834.69: Clearly identify the knoll core business or the divestitures of some part of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5834.71-5844.14: Or possibly be discussed at the company it seems. And now the company has concluded that the spin-off is a correct option. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5844.82-5848.95: But in terms of the divestitures compared to spin-off,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5851.33-5853.79: Compared to the divestitures versus spin-off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5854.25-5860.24: Why did you conclude that spin-off generates the larger upsides in the company's shareholder value? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5860.46-5866.87: And what is the benefit of having a split? So could you elaborate on that specifically? That is the first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5867.17-5868.35: The second question is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5868.65-5878.38: Pertaining to the presentation by Tanakawa-san at the outset that business portfolio will opt for the further revisions and portfolio realignment going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5878.90-5881.20: That's how I understood your presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5881.52-5889.57: Ultimately, being Toshiba Group, what would be the desirable ways of how Toshiba would be like in the future? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5890.03-5896.82: I think it will be beyond what you have decided on in two years' time, beyond that, as a result of the spin-off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5897.74-5906.31: Do you think that a complete ASAP or any of the three entities would be the ultimate form of the company or do you see further realignment of the company? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5906.51-5909.07: Do you have any visions beyond a two-year time? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5909.97-5917.34: Now question one and two, I think some parts are interlinked. So at the beginning in the medium term plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5918.68-5926.41: Inclusive non-core and core, it is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and non-core. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5926.69-5934.49: But we tried to focus on what the company's layout would be in the near future. So that was the focal point this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5934.85-5938.34: And therefore the identifying core versus non-core. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5938.80-5945.21: Is actually on the ongoing discussion at this moment as well and we will continue that discussion going forward as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5945.73-5951.77: So what we have announced this time is just a starting point of improving the value going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5952.01-5956.50: So there will be two new calls as soon as possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5959.20-5968.11: They will prepare the business plan on their own and we'd like to provide opportunities so that two new girls will be able to present their own business plan for the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5968.51-5970.15: Going back to the first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5971.25-5978.76: What is the strength and what was the advantage of the split idea versus the divestitures? There are three squares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5978.78-5984.58: In the previous presentations and I am CEO of this company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5984.78-5988.47: And therefore cash flow from the main business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5988.89-5996.64: Is the core challenge for me and that is the main theme in my opinion and therefore focused and agile business management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5996.94-5999.66: Is the very important point in my view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5999.84-6007.97: Sorry, I'm talking too long, but in retrospect, I've been serving as CEO and COO for a very long time for this company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6008.43-6014.93: And what I remorse about is that we were able to, we were not able to exercise the growth strategy properly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6015.24-6020.40: So at the right timing, we'd like to make an investment at the appropriate timing. We'd like to be very agile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6020.86-6027.11: And we have a very good technology at the highest or top in the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6027.49-6036.06: And were we able to use our marketing capabilities in a very quick and agile way? The question remains as is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6036.34-6039.68: So because of the split this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6039.78-6048.73: I hope that senior management who have specialized knowledge about this area will be able to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6048.75-6050.17: I shall have decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6050.19-6060.00: And I hope that this particular shortcoming of myself will be resolved in the separation of the businesses. So I try to answer two questions at once. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6062.50-6071.43: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6072.27-6075.72: From SNBC Niko Securities, Yoshizumi-san. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6077.84-6082.44: This is Yoshizumi of SNBC Niko Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6082.90-6087.85: Thank you very much. I have two questions. First question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6088.87-6092.63: Is through separation to unlock value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6092.89-6099.70: What is the concrete image of unlocking value through spin-off conglomerate discount will be resolved? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6101.04-6102.52: I think that was the basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6103.38-6111.19: So, are you sure that this congruent merit-demerit discount can be resolved? So, could you please give us your specific opinion? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6111.73-6123.42: In fiscal year 2023, the operating income of 200 billion yen, which is rather conservative and infrastructure service ROIC is still 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6123.94-6125.39: I think earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6125.41-6134.53: Infrastructure service will achieve 30%, infrastructure system 10%. So in total, at least 20% can be secured. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6134.55-6138.06: I think that there will be the improvement, the room. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6138.12-6147.55: But after the split and then 10% ROIC and then do you think that the conglomerate discount can be really cleared or resolved? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6148.07-6151.43: This is my first question about your expectation on these points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6153.23-6161.14: Okay, I would like to respond first and I would like to ask Hatazawa-san to supplement. And this time, unlocking the value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6162.14-6171.65: This is the headline, but the purpose itself is not to resolve the conglomerate discount. We needed to clarify the structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6171.95-6179.44: So that each individual stand-alone company will be able to manage their business respectively in an easy to understand manner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6179.60-6182.10: As a result, the performance will be bettered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6182.32-6188.27: So it will lead to the resolution of the conglomerate discount. This is what I am feeling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6189.79-6193.61: Regarding numbers, I said earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6195.28-6199.68: The numbers that can be achievable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6199.72-6207.57: Because we have been pointed out about the lack of achieving whatever commitment we have been making in the past,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6207.67-6211.87: So there was the criticism from the sources on the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6211.93-6216.50: That's why we came up with these numbers, which seem to be sure to be achieved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6217.46-6224.40: Hata Zawa is going to supplement and in 2025 and towards 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6224.68-6232.73: We presented a plan towards those years and internally we have that forecast or targets for 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6233.25-6238.30: And based upon the opinion from external parties, we were asked to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6238.32-6244.86: Secure the delivery on the committed numbers. So that's why we came up with the conservative plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6245.15-6248.49: And we are showing the plan for the coming three years alone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6249.57-6252.25: And in fiscal year 24, 25. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6252.55-6255.68: We have a plan in... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6255.70-6262.82: Inside the company and would like to disclose those plans at the appropriate opportunity and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6262.86-6271.37: We talked about the importance of investing in R&D activities and results will be realized in fiscal year 24 and 25. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6274.27-6282.30: And external parties, particularly listening to the voices of shareholders and within the short period of time until fiscal year 23,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6282.80-6287.61: What can be secured to be achieved and what can be achieved in the short term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6287.83-6292.37: It should be presented, so you may think that these numbers seem to be a little weak. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6292.63-6296.78: But I'm sorry, that was the basis for coming up with this number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6297.16-6304.80: And we wanted to incorporate some risk buffers. So that's why we came up with this plan. That's all. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6305.69-6311.57: My second question is for CFO. In the coming two years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6311.59-6316.08: Share buyback in the level of 100 billion yen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6317.42-6329.85: You said and is it related to the sale of the shares in Keoxia or it is not included in the buy back plan and utilizing NOL. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6330.43-6337.16: And then what will be the advantage, benefits of the tax issues at the time of sale? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6339.28-6345.39: So, a qualitative comment will be, okay, so could you please give us your comment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6346.33-6348.19: Thank you very much for your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6349.31-6357.76: Regarding your first question, as Mr. Kusunokawa mentioned, at our company,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6358.02-6362.54: We have a yardstick of so-called appropriate level of capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6362.84-6369.99: So capital exceeding that appropriate level will be returned to shareholders. That's what we have been saying. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6370.07-6378.84: As Hattasawasan mentioned earlier, in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming 2022,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6379.76-6381.72: In these years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6381.80-6390.85: We came up with this rather sure plan, therefore we will be able to achieve this net income number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6391.33-6401.30: So considering all these and according to our calculation, we'll be able to return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6402.74-6408.61: So regarding the gains from the sale of Kyoksha shares is outside of this number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6409.19-6413.41: And regarding the NOL, net operating loss, you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6414.15-6420.00: Well, as you know, according to the tax law for the current fiscal year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6420.46-6426.03: Half of the amount recorded in the fiscal year can be utilized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6426.45-6431.55: So based on the balance sheet, there is an NOL in the amount of about 300 billion yen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6431.97-6440.96: So how and when Kiyoksha, stake in Kiyoksha can be sold at any point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6441.52-6446.29: So if at that time, if we still have the NOL, and then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6446.31-6452.45: About half of the gains obtained through the sale of Kioxia shares will be offset by the NOL. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6452.81-6462.34: Thank you very much. Understood. Thank you. Next, UBS. Yes, Maksim. Please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6465.17-6469.19: Thank you. UBS, this is Yese speaking. Yes, we hear you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6471.83-6472.87: I have one question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6474.75-6478.32: But there are three aims in asking my one question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6481.10-6484.64: So this announcement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6484.68-6492.75: About how management is done, also how the business exists. I am sure that there was a lot of discussion on these matters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6493.21-6498.52: So, the ideal state of Toshiba. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6499.26-6502.16: What do you believe is the most ideal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6502.78-6504.04: I know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6504.08-6513.67: That it could be something unrealistic, but could you explain about the ideal state of Toshiba? The reason I am asking, there are three reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6515.90-6525.47: What do you think the issue of Toshiba is and the process, not how you've reflected,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6525.49-6531.75: If there's anything, an event that has led you to the process and also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6531.79-6540.00: Second part is that when selecting the management of the new separated company,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6540.84-6554.65: When you want to hand over to the new management, what is your ambition? What is your hope that the new management to realize? And also the three-part is that the USGE also have decided the separation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6554.71-6562.36: So, I believe that separation spin-off is now being questioned and this is something beyond shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6562.86-6570.59: So what is the significance, meaning of separation? I understand being agile, that is one of the advantages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6571.03-6574.71: Also, this has been said from the early 2000s. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6574.77-6585.65: And so why now today separation spin-off is being decided? Does that reflect something in society? So these are my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6587.79-6597.06: I would like to respond and if any of the two of my colleagues have anything to add. So what is the ideal state? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6597.34-6600.66: So I know that this will differ, but for myself,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6602.20-6603.60: When we have a business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6604.08-6612.51: And we are trying to solve the social issues around us and that is what is happening on a daily basis and the repetition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6613.39-6615.22: Personally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6615.98-6621.64: The company brand, that is nothing, that is not where I am particular about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6622.06-6630.53: Well, medical, social medical, some went to get a medical and would give it a COVID situation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6631.89-6640.00: MRI, for example, they are very well positioned in Japan, globally, which is very. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6640.98-6643.86: And, although I'm sad that her Shiva name is gone,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6644.84-6651.73: But what I have done is contributing to society and seeing it growing, that itself makes me very happy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6652.13-6659.42: So, in the same sense, in the same note, that what we are doing in our business, that our employees being satisfied. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6659.66-6664.60: And also contributing to society, I think that is the ideal way, ideal state. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6665.29-6666.97: So, even in the form. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6666.99-6672.77: That it is split into two or more with the name changes, but our mission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6672.79-6677.70: Itself, how we execute and realize the mission, I think that is the important part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6678.10-6682.44: And so I was questioning myself, what is the ideal state? I know that I'm talking a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6682.60-6692.53: So perhaps this will be my response and also to ask what I expect towards the future management, especially the largest issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6692.55-6696.80: Is governance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6697.52-6702.90: So when it comes to governance, this is going to be the fundamentals and management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6703.34-6712.15: And governance enhancement committee has pointed out that although it may take some time that we want to reconstruct the governance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6712.21-6715.14: And also with a new company, Management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6716.62-6718.56: There was a mention about what type. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6718.58-6720.56: Is suitable and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6720.64-6733.69: It is mentioned sometimes we will see talent from the outside of the market and also something with the capability of the governance perspective that is going to be some of the basics requirements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6734.27-6740.96: Qualifications and it was just by chance that GE also announced that Nikkei's leak. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6741.30-6747.31: With that, we were a little earlier with our scheme to be known. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6747.73-6752.55: I don't know if this answers Yesi's question, but that is my impression. Do you have anything to add? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6754.98-6763.22: I think that what each individual will be answering will be different. So this is my personal view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6765.69-6774.15: Myself, I believe that Toshiba's mission in philosophy is that what is asked for by Toshiba. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6774.47-6782.52: And we have the responsibility to execute our responsibility. So that is what we are required of, and that is the reason of existence. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6785.91-6791.07: So that is one thing. On the other hand, what clients, customers request us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6791.57-6800.20: Sometimes the time is different and also the requirement is different, meaning that sometimes we cannot make. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6800.22-6805.61: Management decision which has been pointed out as an issue, I think this applies to GE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6806.05-6810.15: The management environment has changed. Speed is required. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6810.41-6816.76: So not like at time in the past with a lot of things mixtured in between. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6817.16-6826.85: We will not be able to catch up and we cannot make a pure decision in order to survive. So that is why I believe that spin off or separation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6826.87-6828.63: Could be one of the trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6829.73-6830.77: Oui. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6830.83-6844.44: Have the infrastructure, energy and serve the clients in this industry and we believe that Toshiba may have only the answer and for the device and disk and also for the future information society. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6845.02-6846.53: What is required of Toshiba? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6847.61-6849.39: We need to create the solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6849.59-6852.69: In a quickly manner that is requested by our clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6852.77-6861.48: I think that is what we exist for and that is the reasoning for why we have decided on this decision and also it matches the needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6865.15-6868.37: Also, let me also say a few words. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6869.89-6872.77: From a financial position perspective,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6872.79-6880.00: From a shareholder we have the equity and also we want to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6880.70-6884.62: Steadily increase the value that is also the mission of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6884.68-6889.35: For this to happen, as Hadassah Hasan mentioned,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6890.81-6907.81: We need to win the trust of our clients' customers and also we have to deliver the products and services that is required of. And what is most important is that the employees also share the same mission, look at the same direction, be aligned in the same mission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6908.09-6913.93: So eventually that will lead to increase the value for the shareholders and unlock the values. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6916.58-6922.34: There are various means to realize this and given the current situation of Toshiba. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6922.92-6928.31: What we have been discussing and what we are trying to execute this framework. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6928.33-6934.29: Is going to be the best path forward for the shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6934.31-6936.90: I personally believe so strongly. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6941.82-6950.23: Thank you very much. Next, we would like to invite from Goldman Sachs Mr. Harada, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6953.05-6957.34: This is Harada speaking from Komansar. Thank you. Can you all hear me? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6958.32-6967.03: Thank you. Now, I would like to ask one question. Now, my question may sound very similar to the previous questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6967.23-6975.20: Now, infrastructure services and device that you are going to separate into and infrastructure services company, let's solve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6976.54-6980.54: Is considered a conglomerate in my opinion when you look at the business structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6980.88-6989.77: On the global basis, for example, elevators could be divestitures going forward or carved out going forward. And going forward,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6990.45-6996.80: Do you think that further realignment of military services in scope or in your vision at this point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 6997.60-7001.92: And in addition, there are many conglomerate-based companies in Japan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7003.06-7008.35: Be good or bad. Your company is having a good connection with Metis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7009.99-7015.16: Than in order to enhance competitiveness of the overall corporate Japan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7015.28-7022.14: Perhaps the real lament of the companies involving whole corporate society in Japan is perhaps is considered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7022.44-7028.37: Was that a part of the discussion with them? And also, being a part of the concept on the side of the senior management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7028.75-7037.88: Would that be also something that you would consider if a good opportunity arises? Are you conscious of this type of operation or opportunity? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7039.78-7043.82: So if we're a structured company, there are a variety of businesses included. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7044.36-7047.31: However, there are some common denominators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7047.53-7050.75: For example, be it services and subscription models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7051.05-7057.62: And it is quite a high potential of sharing the commonality across the different businesses in the infrastructure services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7057.96-7059.30: But like I mentioned earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7059.56-7068.65: Portfolio review exercise will continue and there's nothing that we have decided at this point in time and yet we'd like to continue to discuss going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7070.61-7074.47: Now, regarding the realignment of industries in Japan,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7074.69-7083.26: My position is at least that we reviewed all possible opportunities and options exhaustively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7083.80-7093.37: Think about all the stakeholders such as shareholders, employees and society, large customers and we'd like to review from that point of view. That is my position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7094.71-7097.84: Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comment. That is all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7099.26-7100.28: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7101.84-7107.45: Now, we'd like to entertain one last question at this point in time. SBI, Itsumi-san, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7109.37-7118.92: Thank you very much. I have two questions regarding spin-off to list span of companies on the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7120.06-7123.78: I am not experienced in this area, so could you please give us timeline? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7124.58-7130.77: For new calls, including their balance sheets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7131.89-7143.42: The treatment of such accounting will be starting from the third quarter of this fiscal year 21 and then in two years from today, a spin-off will be completed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7144.74-7153.75: This is my understanding. Is this correct? And the second question is about the company names of the Nucos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7154.77-7161.72: Do you plan to name with Toshiba in the company's name, like Kyoksuya or another? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7162.02-7168.97: I think that in this scheme, I think the new company's name will be like the ones as Kiyokusha. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7170.41-7172.47: Regarding the timeline,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7173.71-7182.18: For the companies to be listed on the market, there needs to be two fiscal year financial results to be audited. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7182.20-7186.37: So therefore our target is in the second half of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7186.95-7194.53: Fiscal year 23, Hirata-san will supplement and regarding the company names there is nothing that has been determined yet. We are going to work out the details. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7194.83-7198.42: Regarding timeline, could you please supplement? Yes, Hirata speaking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7199.34-7205.05: Let me supplement a little bit. I think on page 12, there is the schedule or timeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7209.13-7213.95: We would like to observe and follow this timeline as much as possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7214.25-7220.10: And with some better ideas or devising the ideas we'd like to shorten this duration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7221.84-7230.03: As you can see here, there is a necessity for two fiscal year's financial numbers to be audited. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7231.39-7237.86: This is the requirement by TSE and for this fiscal year 2022, the numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7238.08-7243.28: Operation is based upon the assumption that the current organizational structure will continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7243.92-7247.79: And of course, there are a lot to be worked out with auditors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7248.25-7254.73: And for fiscal year 2021 the financial results to be closed based on the current Toshiba's organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7254.75-7260.08: And then that will be the basis for the new codes and then we will divide the numbers into two companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7260.10-7265.37: At some point in fiscal year 2022, we would like to finalize the numbers for the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7265.39-7267.49: New companies to be established. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7267.77-7270.67: In parallel for fiscal year 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7270.69-7275.94: Based on the current consolidation under the Toshiba Group and financial statement will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7275.96-7282.94: Prepared and based upon the three new codes we are going to create three separate financial statements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7284.86-7289.69: So that we will be working in line with the current timeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7289.71-7295.12: And regarding the internal control examination to be conducted by auditors as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7295.98-7300.00: So of course for Toshiba Corporation,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7300.52-7307.69: On the current consolidation basis, of course we would continue operation for fiscal year 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7307.93-7314.63: So in parallel with that, based upon the new organizational structure, which will be created. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7314.69-7319.38: And so that the internal control will be functioning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7319.68-7329.61: So we will check whether internal control will be working well in such a new organisation structure. So it is going to be complicated during 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7330.31-7335.70: Until the end of fiscal year 2022, current organisation structure will be maintained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7336.08-7343.08: But in parallel, we will prepare gradually the separate balance sheets for three new companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7344.52-7353.19: Of course, there are a lot to be done, but roughly speaking, this is our current plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7355.86-7357.30: Otherwise additives will be done on it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7359.26-7367.69: But there was one question left from the media, so we would like to take the last question. Mr. Washio, Ryoichi, are you still connected? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7378.40-7380.52: So we will close the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7380.92-7390.63: So there is one correction, Tanakawa mentioned, is that about the spin-off related, is that there was a leak from the Nikkei article. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7391.87-7396.26: It is not a leak by the company, so I want to make a correction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 7397.36-7405.37: So thank you very much for all the participants coming to the press release and also those participating through the phone, please make sure that you hang off. 
asr:0: END
