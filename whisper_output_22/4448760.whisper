asr:0: OUTPUT 185.29-189.69: During the second quarter of the year, the global economy continued to recover. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 190.09-198.70: There are, however, material differences in the recoveries of countries depending on the effectiveness of these countries' vaccination programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 199.58-206.27: Additionally, new variants of the virus such as the Delta Plus and more recently the Gamma variant continue to appear. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 206.55-212.37: For now, it is apparent that the vaccinations being administered are effective against these new variants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 212.49-216.60: However, where this is not the case, economic recoveries would be curtailed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 217.34-223.50: In any case, clear evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccination programs resides in the fact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 223.52-228.61: That although people continue to get infected, the lethality of the virus has drastically dropped. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 229.29-235.88: Colombia has not been the exception to the economic recovery or to a well-administered vaccination program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 236.54-244.36: To date, more than 30 million doses have been administered and more than 13 million people have been fully immunized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 245.27-252.71: This progress in the vaccination program, along with better external conditions, have boosted the recovery of the Colombian economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 253.33-264.28: This recovery has not been devoid of headwinds, specifically the violent demonstrations and strikes that plagued the country mostly during the months of April and May. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 265.15-270.91: However, after a drop in consumer confidence, not surprisingly during April and May,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 270.93-277.60: As of July, this indicator has recovered and is now at its highest level since the start of the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 277.62-289.77: Supported by the progress of the vaccination campaign, better unemployment numbers, renewed commercial activity, and higher prices of export commodities such as coffee and oil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 290.67-297.90: High frequency data, such as energy demand, suggests that business activity is advancing towards its pre-pandemic level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.66-306.19: As a result, analysts have continued to raise their estimates of the GDP growth forecast for Colombia during 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 306.87-312.13: The OECD, for example, now forecasts a GDP growth of 7.6% for 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 312.69-320.08: And the IMF is expected to raise its projections in August given the positive outcome of recent months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 320.84-329.01: In its latest meeting, the central bank revised its own growth forecast from 6.5% to 7.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 329.55-335.38: And in a while, we now forecast that the economy will grow approximately 7% in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 336.86-346.57: Moving on to the labor market, in June, the unemployment rate fell to 14.4% and the number of jobs increased by 161,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 347.53-360.00: The average unemployment rate during the second quarter was 15% compared to 15.8% during the first quarter and 20.3% a year earlier. Of course,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 360.80-362.96: There is still a long way to go on this front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 363.42-373.87: Despite the mentioned improvement, there are still approximately 1.4 million jobs that still need to be recovered to bring us back to the pre-pandemic levels of employment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 374.65-381.60: If these jobs were recovered, the country would experience a drop of between 6 and 7% in unemployment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 382.38-390.51: For now, as the recovery process continues, we expect a further decline in the unemployment rate to 12% by year's end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 390.53-395.18: Reaching an average of 14.8% for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 396.54-406.33: In June, 12-month inflation reached 3.63%, 204 basis points higher when compared to inflation during 2010. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 407.99-413.33: This year's number has been driven mainly by supply factors and by statistical base effect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 413.79-423.30: In fact, the surge of food prices of 5.5% in May was triggered by the disruptions of supply and logistics that arose from the strikes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 423.98-431.13: As of July, 12-month inflation had risen by 34 basis points versus June to 3.97%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.83-439.20: This increase was driven by food prices, which rose by 40 basis points, and by higher prices in service sectors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 439.22-445.45: As a result of higher activity leisure industries such as restaurants, hotels, recreation and culture. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 446.11-448.09: We expect that inflation for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 448.15-457.68: 2021 will reach 4% as food prices revert, offset by the pass-through of higher commodity prices and as shipping costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 459.12-466.59: Although medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 3% given the recent surge in consumer prices,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 466.61-469.35: The weaker peso and the growth prospects? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 469.77-474.94: We expect that the central bank will start a monetary policy tightening cycle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 474.95-481.52: In the last quarter with a high probability of two 25 basis point hikes before the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 481.98-489.71: In that scenario, the repo rate will increase to 2.25% from its current 1.75% level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 490.45-497.54: Regarding the exchange rate, in the last few weeks, the peso has weakened to as high as 4,000 pesos per dollar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 497.56-501.24: Due to the strengthening of the dollar in international markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 501.26-511.25: As investors seek shelter in safe assets caused by the renewed uncertainty owing to the spread of the Delta variant and also due to the increasing Colombia's risk premium. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 511.95-518.92: However, with the projection that the central bank will start a new monetary tightening cycle and if as expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 519.22-523.24: Congress approves the proposed tax reform, to which I will refer in a minute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 523.44-529.99: It is likely that the Colombian peso will seek a level close to 3700 pesos per dollar in the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 531.01-539.42: The government has presented a new tax reform that seeks to increase tax revenues by 15 trillion pesos or 1.2% of GDP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.22-547.01: The additional revenue would mainly originate from increasing the corporate tax rate to 35% starting in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 547.45-552.67: Instead of reducing it to 30% as approved in the 2019 tax reform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 553.41-560.10: The financial sector, however, will continue to pay a 3% surcharge over the corporate rate until 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.48-564.32: The surcharge was expected to cease by 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 565.21-574.15: Other components of the tax reform include reducing tax deductible expenses, strengthening legal measures to fight tax evasion, and freezing government spending. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 574.75-581.10: This new tax reform has greater political support and is expected to be approved in Congress in the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.76-589.15: In the meantime, the government expects the fiscal deficit to reach 2021 at 8.6% of GDP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 589.17-592.45: With a primary deficit of 5.3% of GDP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.57-599.84: Regarding the current account deficit, it is expected to widen to 4.4% of GDP by year's end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.00-604.74: Up from the 3.3% that GDP observed at the end of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 605.35-614.35: Pent-up demand should translate into a larger trade deficit that will be partially upset by larger and better priced oil and coffee exports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 615.22-622.28: With respect to Central America, the IMF expects a 5.7% growth of the region's economy in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.96-635.58: As discussed in the past, Central America greatly benefits from the recovery of the U.S. Economy as certain Central American countries are highly dependent on cash remittances incoming from the United States. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.42-644.94: Economic growth of the region should be positively impacted by the infrastructure sector as these countries that were affected by storms, ADA and IOTA,.

asr:0: OUTPUT 648.83-655.10: During the first two months of the second quarter, Panama estimated an annual GDP growth of 16.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 655.12-659.92: And during the same period Costa Rica estimated GDP growth of 12.3%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 660.58-670.73: Panama benefits from the reactivation of global trade and foreign investment, given its role as a global maritime transportation hub, and the consequential increase in canal activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 671.35-676.80: In Costa Rica, 6 out of 15 economic sectors reached pre-pandemic production levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 677.58-685.63: Remittances have surged year on year, 55% in El Salvador, 43% in Guatemala, and 44% in Honduras.

asr:0: OUTPUT 695.16-697.92: And 28.4% in Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 698.58-707.07: Guatemala and Honduras' growth will be boosted, as I said before, by increases in fiscal spending to reconstruct damaged infrastructure after the mentioned storms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 707.99-709.05: Finally,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 709.07-718.14: Based on leading indicators, year-on-year economic estimated growth reached 15.2% in Nicaragua during the first two months of the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.70-727.31: Despite internal and external favorable economic conditions, growth in Nicaragua could be limited by the challenging political context. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 728.97-738.74: Moving on to the status of our loan relief programs, as of June, we had active reliefs represented approximately 11.5% of our total consolidated loan portfolio.

asr:0: OUTPUT 758.96-766.15: In Central America, reliefs amounted to 16.5 trillion pesos, representing 20.9% of the region's portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.19-774.23: These reliefs in Central America were driven by Panama, which accounted for more than half of the region's active reliefs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 775.20-779.40: Of all loans in both geographies that have concluded their relief periods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 779.42-786.27: Those currently past due 90 days or more represent only 1% of our total consolidated loan portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 786.83-793.31: And those currently passed through 30 days or more represent 1.8% of our total consolidated loan portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 794.15-802.38: Our cost of risk, as it's been booked, reflects our estimation of losses related to the complete unwinding of these relief programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.98-810.83: We continue to execute our digital strategy in accordance with our expectations. Allow me to elaborate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 811.61-818.82: As I have mentioned before, we have prioritized the transformation of our core products into digital solutions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.84-822.90: And the digitalization of core processes in our banks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.62-832.29: We believe that both those efforts will yield additional net income via additional sales revenues and cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.39-843.14: We have successfully concluded the digitalization of most of our retail bank products and are now in the process of rolling those out to all our banks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 844.10-847.75: This has led us to increase our digital retail sales substantially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 848.39-855.46: In Colombia, 60% of all sales of retail products for which a digitalized solution has been developed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 855.48-864.70: Are currently conducted through the digital applications and 40% of those are end-to-end digital cells without human intervention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.49-871.75: These sales represent almost 40% of our total digitalized and non-digitalized retail products sold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.63-878.30: In Central America, approximately 25% of total sales are sales of digitalized products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 879.28-885.55: As part of our IT transformation process, our digitalization effort is cloud-based. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.75-893.73: Allowing us to scale up faster and cheaper than with traditional IT infrastructure models. Allow me to explain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 894.96-900.52: First, all of our digital products are already 100% in the cloud or cloud native. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 901.12-909.27: As a result, we do not need to further invest to migrate the infrastructure of our digital products to the cloud because we're already there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 910.25-915.14: Secondly, our centralized data platforms in our digital labs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 915.16-917.12: Such as Augusta and Matilde. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 917.32-925.97: Are also in the cloud, allowing us to be more efficient in our processes, reduce operational costs, and increase our client penetration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 926.61-927.77: But building. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 927.79-937.14: It's a marketing platform which has allowed us to acquire new digital clients at what we currently believe is the lowest acquisition cost in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 937.92-941.92: This adds to the capabilities of our data platform, Augusta. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 941.94-948.89: Which has allowed us to improve our cost of client acquisition, cross-selling, customer retention,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 948.91-954.11: And risk mitigation, among others, through advanced analytical models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 955.52-965.75: As of June 2021, our active digital clients totaled 5.2 million, increasing approximately 31% in the last 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.73-974.71: Even though adding active digital clients is a necessary step for digital transformation, obtaining long-term sustainable value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 974.75-978.00: As a result of this effort is the primary objective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 978.64-987.51: High acquisition costs of digital clients have led us to be watchful of what we have denominated net loss growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 987.97-993.85: Associated with one transaction users or those that lack potential to be monetized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 994.59-1000.00: In Colombia, a country with very strict usury rate restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1000.28-1010.23: Transactional platforms with low or no fees will find it difficult to sell profitable banking products regardless of their number of digital customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1010.95-1018.56: We have been working in alternative ways to acquire new digital clients that meet our profitability criteria. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1018.58-1027.87: Leveraging ecosystems that provide services that are valuable to our clients and where profitable products of our banks are part of the solution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.43-1030.07: Among those, first,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1030.37-1033.39: In Colombia about digital labs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1033.41-1041.76: Has been working to redesign popular existing websites such as Carrollá, Metro Cuadrado, and ElEmpleo.com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1041.80-1051.49: And to add to those ecosystems additional products, including banking digital products to further our goal of adding profitability to digital growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.27-1061.64: Being part of these ecosystems afford our banks the opportunity to increase digital clients through auto loans, mortgages, payroll loans, and other products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1062.28-1066.43: These ecosystems currently serve over 10 million users. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.25-1071.41: In Central America, we recently launched cash with a K. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1071.91-1081.26: A transactional app available across the region that already has 100,000 digital clients, 70% of which are not back clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.28-1084.58: With more than 350,000 transactions to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.35-1089.41: Soon, family remittances will be available through our cash app. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.73-1097.12: This will allow us not only to acquire at least 500,000 additional profitable digital clients by year-end,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1097.14-1101.70: But also to increase our remittances fee income and to make our app profitable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1102.60-1107.45: Finally, in Colombia we're improving our digital channels to better fit our customers' needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1107.81-1111.37: Banco Popular launched recently its banking app. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1111.39-1119.30: At the beginning of the year and we expect Banco de Occidente and Banco de Avivillas to launch their new apps in the next couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1120.02-1126.33: These apps have a more modern, intuitive, and secure design that will contribute to a better customer experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1127.39-1131.23: In Central America, our focus has been primarily on customer service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1131.71-1141.44: In 2021, 54% of client interactions have been conducted through digital channels and 46% through our call centers and others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.10-1148.63: Customers have quickly adopted the mobile channel as their preferred means to make the request. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1149.25-1157.08: Almost 20% of those queries are picked up and handled by chatbots and resolved without human intervention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1158.94-1166.75: To finish, regarding our financial results, Diego will refer next in detail to our financial performance during the second quarter of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1166.89-1169.31: However, allow me to highlight the following. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1170.97-1179.76: To start with, Grupo Al registered its best results ever for a quarter with a attributable netting of approximately $900,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1179.80-1181.08: 50 billion pesos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.70-1187.89: A valid attributable net income for the first half of 2021 was 1.74 trillion pesos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1188.43-1196.60: This resulted in a return on average equity for the quarter of 18.2%.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2374.69-2381.00: Okay, let me start with your question number 11 on digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.86-2385.63: What I meant is the following. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2387.71-2398.70: What we see around the region with FinTech platforms that have been able to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2398.72-2401.98: Turning net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.02-2405.59: Is basically the,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2405.61-2414.25: Not charging fees, but charging substantial interest rates in one way or another. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2415.28-2422.48: In Colombia, as I said, it's a little bit more complicated because we have very strict usury rate regulation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2423.10-2429.47: So here, when you bring on digital clients,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2429.57-2433.55: You have to consider how you're going to monetize them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.61-2442.62: And you can massively increase your digital clients in those sort of platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.28-2456.78: But if in that massification you acquire a lot of digital clients that will probably not transect too much, like for example clients that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2456.80-2461.12: It just becomes so to receive subsidies from the government. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.98-2470.93: Or other types of clients that will probably not be subject to becoming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.95-2474.51: Debtors via loans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2475.50-2482.88: It might be a little bit harder to monetize them. I don't have the solution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.74-2489.51: And I am sure that everybody who is coming up with a digital platform has thought about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2490.11-2500.66: And obviously, most of it is going to depend on what your cost of funds is. If you are planning to take in funds to then try to make those customers into borrowers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2501.04-2505.15: It also depends on your costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2505.17-2506.19: Structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.21-2524.60: And obviously, some of these fintechs, which are starting from the beginning as solely digital platforms with no legacy of other types of costs, have an easier time of keeping costs down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2524.99-2533.49: But all that I'm saying is, in our case, when we think about massification of digital clients,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2534.37-2542.50: We always think in terms of what's that going to produce with respect to net income for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2543.02-2544.32: So, um... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2544.34-2556.56: In that respect, we usually say, let's start with those actions that we know are going to result in valuation and valuation via additional net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2556.94-2561.94: Because as you know, we are basically valued based on a price to earnings ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2562.38-2564.18: And so we have to produce the earnings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2564.70-2568.71: And that's why we're saying in our... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2568.73-2573.51: In our strategy, we first decided we would put a lot of empathy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2573.53-2580.22: On being able to offer our own legacy products in a digital manner so that new clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2580.24-2582.16: Could acquire them that way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2582.62-2591.79: And secondly, we've been going through the digitalization of processes and operations in the banks, and that has resulted in cost savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2592.25-2599.92: We will obviously not discard in any shape the idea of massifying digital clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2599.94-2605.51: But we have to make sure and that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.53-2611.53: That those clients have some future in terms of producing additional revenues for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2612.57-2618.02: So that's what I was referring to when I talked about our digital strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2619.60-2628.99: Moving to your guidance questions, regarding return on equity, even though we are not giving guidance on 2022 on this call,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2629.49-2632.77: Just to give you a framework to think around it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2632.97-2641.66: We have a few things that are still to continue improving into the future, particularly cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2641.68-2644.32: Improve throughout the year and into next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2645.19-2651.35: That has been part of what has helped us in sustaining our stronger results than market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2651.91-2656.20: And we expect to continue seeing that improvement into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2656.82-2659.98: The other part that will be helping us as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2660.46-2666.05: It's all that is related to increased macro activity in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.07-2671.59: Regarding stronger growth and increasing rates for banks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2671.61-2679.26: A slight increase in rate is always a positive increase in fee income associated with activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2680.00-2687.31: What could a dampen the kind of positive numbers that I'm pointing into it is the tax reform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2687.53-2691.67: It is building in what comes out from that reform is still to be seen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2692.05-2696.38: At this point with the tax reform that is currently in congress. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2696.76-2701.48: The numbers might not change substantially compared to this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2701.82-2707.03: But the expectation of having lower taxes into the future somehow has faded away. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2707.37-2714.79: So we have a combination of improvement on the operational front and then the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2714.81-2718.62: Almost on the last line we have the impact of taxes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2718.90-2728.07: That's a long way to tell you that even though we are not giving guidance, these kind of numbers are numbers that we could expect to continue seeing into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.93-2734.89: Then regarding the breakdown of what is going to happen with loan growth, as mentioned,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2735.58-2740.68: We have a much better performance from the growth perspective on the consumer front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2741.20-2749.67: We could expect to see something in the 12 to 14 percent area growth and on the commercial front it should be somewhere between 6 and 7 percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2750.83-2753.49: If you break down that by regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2754.15-2757.70: Colombia should be in the 6-8% area growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2758.08-2763.12: And Central America should be at a similar rate if you look at it in dollar terms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2763.18-2771.93: By the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2771.95-2774.96: Numbers that we believe could be numbers at the end of year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2775.46-2779.70: So that will help and that will propel what is happening with Central America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2782.44-2785.77: Our next question comes from Adriana de los Bava. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2788.05-2790.21: Congratulations on the results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2791.19-2796.98: I wanted to see if you can help us have a better sense of the income growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2797.68-2806.29: I know in the quarter there were slight impacts from the protest, but if you can help us with that, it would be great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2808.29-2812.83: I'm sorry, were you referring to fee income or to income growth? I didn't hear you properly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2815.12-2823.06: Well, it could be talking about normalized levels of growth, but however you think is best to formulate it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2824.16-2825.55: Okay, well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2826.97-2832.45: Regarding the the loan side. I just mentioned it before it is volume wise we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2832.47-2837.60: The dynamics I just covered when referring to Sebastian's question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2838.42-2840.22: Regarding Martin's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.02-2848.19: We're actually moving into a better ground for margins given that we expect to see the central bank increasing rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2848.87-2856.34: And the fees side, we mentioned we are slightly short from loan growth because loan growth is starting to come stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2857.06-2866.17: Therefore, if loans are growing in the 9% to 10% area, we could see a couple percentage points below that on the fee side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2867.33-2873.17: P still has some room to increase particularly for two reasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2873.73-2875.88: Number one on the pension side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2875.90-2889.55: We had some impact during this quarter of volatility that implied that some of our keys that are related to our profitability and the funds was affected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2889.83-2900.54: Bear in mind that there is a lag between how we get those into our P&L and how they happen in the market because we charge fees after returns have been obtained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2900.80-2901.94: We have some delay there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2902.40-2909.25: But. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2909.57-2916.10: We're seeing a pickup in products that are very rich in fees such as credit cards and other consumer products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2916.32-2919.48: That in the past we have de-emphasized and at this point we're. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2919.50-2927.59: Ready to start to open our risk appetite. So that will come with these as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2927.83-2931.95: I know we've covered what you were referring to, but those are the main drivers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2934.07-2940.58: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question, please press star then 1 on your touchtone phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2941.90-2946.53: Our next question comes from Brian Flores from ASA Investment. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2948.09-2950.35: Hi, thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2950.87-2958.30: Can you please confirm what was the guided figure for cost over risk? And then I'll give a second question. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2959.90-2965.89: Okay, regarding cost of risk, you might have noticed that we lowered our guidance we had previously given. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2966.23-2974.99: Initially we started out with 2.5%, lowered it to 2.3% to 2.4%, and this time around we're lowering it to 2.1% to 2.2%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2975.54-2979.14: The reason for that is we're seeing a much better performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2979.16-2982.14: On our loan portfolio, particularly on the retail side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2982.52-2992.51: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2992.53-2998.34: Benefited from relief is also performing much better. So that's the reason we're doing that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2999.36-3007.23: Something there that we're still holding back from being more aggressive is a provision in Central America, particularly in Panama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3007.53-3010.65: Given that they're later in the process of finishing reliefs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3011.03-3015.58: In absence of that, we might have had a positive bias on the numbers that I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3020.30-3029.37: My second question is on 2022. I know it's still a bit early, but we're getting closer to it. Just thinking about your guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3030.09-3038.10: If you have any idea of how any of these lines would look like and what are you aiming for in terms of sustainable ROE. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3039.60-3045.85: I would prefer to stick to the answer to Sebastien regarding guidance and what to expect on ROE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3046.21-3052.75: At this point, I would say we would be very happy to be able to transfer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3052.77-3057.72: Our optimism on the economy and performance into guidance, but we prefer to be prudent at this point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3062.56-3066.47: Our next question comes from Udi Fernandez from JP Morgan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3068.07-3071.63: Hi all, first, congrats on the results, very good quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3072.15-3080.86: I have a question on margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3081.42-3083.40: But my question is regarding the funding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3083.94-3088.13: Do you think you'll be able to keep growing deposits at a healthy pace? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3088.17-3090.75: Over the last one, two years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3090.83-3099.28: We saw you and Colombian banks in general having a very good funding structure, right? Like demand deposits growing, the funding costs coming down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3099.76-3108.27: So my question is, should we see an inflection point for funding cost and we start to see funding costs slightly moving up? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3108.81-3118.14: And how that could affect the margins because that could be negative if that's correct, if that assumption that maybe funding costs will be higher, that can penalize a little bit the needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3118.66-3127.75: But on the other hand, maybe stage 3 lows will peak and that will help a little bit, you have higher rates in Colombia. So I guess the bottom line here is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3127.91-3132.41: What should we expect for NIMS in the coming quarters for you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3132.77-3137.72: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3137.74-3143.46: To. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3144.58-3147.55: We should expect to continue sustaining that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3147.75-3154.75: I mentioned somehow or I hinted twice that we've had excess liquidity that has been a burden on our net interest margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3155.20-3164.70: That's been a prudent way to manage it, particularly in Central America where there's no central banks, with taking excess deposits to what would be the normal way to run the bank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3165.33-3174.67: So a deposit growth, we will have at least some time where we have the leisure of having excess deposits so we can be picky on prices and that will help us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3174.69-3176.12: Over several quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3176.82-3184.70: Regarding margins, we suffer when rates come down, particularly those from the central bank, and we benefit when those go up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.21-3193.69: Something that we have already started to feel is that the IBR from that basically is the interbanking rate in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3193.71-3198.40: Has already started to pick up reflecting expectations on increase of profits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3198.98-3205.49: If you recall what we have in our... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3205.51-3212.25: Commercial portfolio in Colombia is substantially floating loans based on IVR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3212.67-3218.70: So we've started to feel that already benefiting us and expect to see that in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.14-3227.81: Then the other side of the pocket is our retail franchise where it goes it deposits are not as a left to what is happening with the central bank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3228.23-3232.67: And that's the main source of improvement in margin when rates go up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3234.03-3236.96: There's two different types of cycles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3237.28-3246.89: Some cycles where rates are going up because risk is going up, therefore the cost of risk is built into the pricing of the banks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3247.21-3253.57: However, this time around, we're looking into a cycle where rates are going up with an improvement in cost of risk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3253.93-3259.98: So I would say that will be benefiting our margins and more so our margins after cost of risk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3261.70-3263.66: If I may ask just a quick follow-up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3264.02-3268.07: Do you have a sensitivity on rates that you can provide? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3268.31-3276.64: I know the main is not the reference rate, but just as a proxy, like if the rates move up 100 bits, what should we see for your names? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3277.36-3280.80: Well, yeah, you have to build in cost of risk into that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3280.92-3292.01: In the past we used to disclose some sort of sensitivity around the 20 basis points or the 20 cents per dollar kind of sensitivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3292.03-3295.80: But that was pure interest rate sensitivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3295.88-3303.82: However, pricing has become growingly intelligent in Colombia and you have to build in as well the cost of risk into those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3303.94-3310.83: So that has made a difference and perhaps that was what I was pointing out before and it is cycles where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3310.99-3316.84: You're seeing increases in rates combined with improvement in cost of risk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3317.00-3324.36: Are perhaps the most positive and most sensitive or elastic cycles to interest rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3324.70-3333.99: However, we have ceased to do that because of that last factor, and it depends very much on the speed at which the risk premiums are built into prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3335.28-3337.76: Perfect. Thank you and again congrats on the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3347.47-3352.27: And first of all congratulations for the results. I would like to know if you can give us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3352.99-3354.83: Bit more color of your expectation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3355.38-3356.92: Second half of 2012. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3358.58-3359.86: Think the earnings is gonna be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3360.00-3363.76: They are going to behave the same as the first half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3363.90-3367.59: And also I would like to know if you can give us... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3368.13-3374.21: A little bit more color about what are your expectations on loan growth, like if you can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3374.23-3380.00: Give us like the consumption, the consumer, the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3383.68-3392.23: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3392.63-3395.98: I think people are waiting for 2021 to incorporate what is going to happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3399.02-3406.03: Quite positive on how the second half of the year will behave. As I mentioned, still prudent on the cost of risk side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3406.39-3416.28: That's the reason why we're guiding into 15 to 15.5% ROE for the year, in spite of having already overperformed those numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3416.68-3422.48: So we are prudent on that side because the cycle is not over yet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3422.58-3428.45: But we are quite positive on the core banking side of how things are behaving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3428.83-3436.38: And regarding loan growth, just to repeat what I answered Sebastian at the beginning,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3436.84-3442.06: We're looking into commercial lending growing somewhere in the 6% to 8%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3442.18-3449.25: Area and the consumer side, the retail side, growing more in the 12 to 14 percent area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3454.95-3458.64: Our next question comes from Andres Soto from Santander. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3460.96-3463.28: Good morning and thank you for the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3463.54-3473.39: My question is related to expenses. When I compare expenses this quarter with the second quarter of 2019, there is a 14% growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3473.45-3482.74: Obviously, you have inorganic growth in the middle, but still you have real expense growth over that period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3483.10-3490.23: I would like to understand if there is any strategy to achieve efficiency. In the past, you mentioned that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3490.27-3496.22: This could be one of the opportunities that the digital transformation could bring to a group of our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3496.54-3500.92: Through the backend integration of the different brands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3501.36-3505.23: So I would like to understand your thoughts about your expense performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3507.97-3509.35: Well p. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3509.43-3518.64: I will start first with the quantitative discussion here and then we can move into the more strategic one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3518.68-3520.80: Regarding expense growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3522.00-3529.91: I would say 2019 is also a tricky year. It's a tricky year because we had a cost growth throughout the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3530.35-3536.24: It was also affected by a depreciation of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3536.26-3543.44: The US dollar and therefore we saw some effect coming from Central America that started to weigh much more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3543.46-3547.23: Inner costs and also had the conversion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3547.61-3554.03: The numbers when you run them, FX impact are more positive than what the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3554.05-3557.92: You're looking into and I think that's perhaps the way to look at those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3558.32-3565.21: Then you're absolutely right. The MFG acquisition also has some impact there because we're talking of a larger bank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3565.61-3571.73: Therefore, perhaps the best way to look at it is more on the cost to assets or cost to income base to try to have that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3572.35-3582.12: Having said so, part of what are the positive takeaways from the pandemic is we had to go back and rethink a lot of the costs that we had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3582.64-3589.85: The digital front that you rightly mentioned is something that has allowed us to bring costs down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3590.39-3598.72: By the government.
