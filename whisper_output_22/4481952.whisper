asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 3.76-12.27: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 Quarter Results Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 12.85-16.04: There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 17.00-22.30: If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 23.68-30.45: I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr Martin Cummings, General Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 32.87-38.76: Thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to the Evolution Mining December 2021 quarterly conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 39.60-43.80: As Darcy mentioned, my name's Martin Cummings and I'm the General Manager, Investor Relations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 44.84-53.71: This morning on the call we have Jake Klein, our Executive Chairman, Laurie Conway, our CFO and Finance Director, and myself in our group office in Sydney. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 54.91-61.38: Bob Fulker, our Chief Operating Officer, and Glen Masterman, our VP Discovery and Business Development, are dialling in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 63.12-69.45: It has been a tumultuous couple of years and as expected gold's role as a safe haven during those times has been demonstrated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 70.23-79.34: As the pandemic was breaking in early 2020, we saw gold rise from the low of 1,500s per ounce to an all-time high around 2,070 in August that year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 80.56-86.33: We started 2021 with the gold price down from its peak at just under US$1,900 per ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 87.09-92.61: Economies were surging as they emerged from COVID lockdowns and equity markets were printing new highs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 93.71-98.90: Bitcoin was continuing to generate a lot of interest, with some touting it as a new digital gold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 99.82-103.84: And exposure to any metal that ended up in a Tesla was highly sought after. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 105.11-111.43: Gold couldn't catch a bid in early 2021 and the sell-off was brisk, down to $1680 by March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 112.21-119.90: Gold equities would follow and by the end of September, the GDX index of senior gold companies had fallen about 20% year to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 120.00-125.51: With the GDXJJr index even lower, down around 30%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 126.81-128.77: But in the last three months, things have turned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 129.51-137.18: Developing economies are now dealing with soaring inflation, with the Federal Reserve now indicating it will need to respond with rate increases soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 138.32-144.64: The Omicron COVID variant spread quickly, leading some countries to reintroduce or extend lockdowns and restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 145.59-148.97: And recently Russia and Ukraine tension has Europe on high alert. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 150.27-155.08: Bitcoin had an incredible journey in 2021, but has now given back most of those gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 155.98-161.66: Gold's role as a safe haven is returning and we now trade back up around US$18.20 per ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 162.96-171.21: For Australian gold miners, the Australian dollar gold price also went on a wild ride, but we currently sit within 10 to 15% of its all-time high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 171.81-174.61: These really are great prices to be selling our product at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 175.66-185.17: And of course copper had a standout year too, rising around 25%. Evolution is well placed to benefit from this with our copper production materially increasing from this month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 186.17-190.53: With that, I'll now hand over to Jake to introduce the December 2021 quarterly report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 191.65-197.22: Thanks Martin, good morning everyone, welcome to the call, thanks for joining us and Happy New Year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 198.58-207.45: Despite the industry headwinds, COVID, labour shortages and unseasonal rainfall, our teams did extremely well to manage the impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 208.33-211.45: As planned and first articulated to you in July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 211.53-218.42: We anticipate the second half of the year to be materially better than the last six months and are on track to deliver our guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 220.04-228.11: Given the first half performance at Red Lake we expect to be in the bottom half of the production range and between the mid and top end of the cost guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 230.01-237.68: Last quarter, our portfolio was significantly improved by securing 100% ownership of the iconic Ernest Henry copper gold mine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 238.66-242.10: We also concluded the sale of manned carbon to Navarre Minerals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 242.12-249.49: And whilst retaining exposure to the future of the operation, the sale allows us to focus on our larger, higher margin assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 252.39-258.94: We continue to be consistent and diligent in the implementation of our strategy of improving the quality of our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 258.96-266.67: And being laser focused about putting ourselves into a position where we can generate sector-leading returns on the capital we deploy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 267.65-274.43: In our view, this is the holy grail in our industry and is the true measure of a gold company's performance over the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 276.66-281.50: I visited Ernest Henry last week and left very confident that in the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 281.52-286.69: We concluded what is likely to prove one of the most transformative deals in evolution's history. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 288.27-297.06: It is an outstanding operation with a great team and terrific geological upside. We look forward to hosting a number of you there for a site visit in due course. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.90-306.05: The foundations for the transaction were put in place in 2016 when we secured the economic interest in the asset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 306.07-310.75: And since then have built a strong and mutually respectful relationship with Glencore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.77-318.66: That allowed us to negotiate this deal on a bilateral, exclusive basis over the course of a few months last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 320.26-324.88: Our economic interest delivered $79.5 million in cash flow last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 325.25-332.69: And now with 100% of the operation being included from 1 January, we expect its impact to be even bigger going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 334.11-337.88: The CAVE extension pre-feasibility study will be a priority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 337.90-346.67: And with intersections 400 metres below the study area and still open below that, Ernest Henry has a long and very exciting future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.23-355.07: Cal performed extremely well and managed to deliver to plan in spite of unprecedented rainfall and COVID interruptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 355.98-363.24: The underground project which will grow cows' production to 350,000 ounces per annum remains on schedule and budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 365.07-368.77: I was also fortunate to be able to visit Red Lake in November last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 369.55-375.64: Due to COVID travel restrictions, this was my first visit since we took ownership of the asset in April 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 377.82-383.30: Red Lake is one of the best commercial opportunities I've seen in the gold sector in my career. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 384.72-390.51: For the combined purchase price of $650 million US dollars being Red Lake and Battle North. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 390.67-399.58: We have secured a district scale tenement position with 11 million ounces of resource and significant exploration upside. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.44-409.53: Seven kilometers of prospective strike with associated mining infrastructure, three mills and $700 million of Canadian tax losses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 411.03-417.98: In time, this asset will be transformed into a plus 350,000 ounce a year low-cost producer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 418.98-421.20: This is how value is created in our sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 422.44-428.47: As you will hear from Bob, who has just returned from his third visit in the last five months, progress is being made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 429.41-433.71: Last quarter we consistently achieved over 1200 metres of development each month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 433.75-441.66: As a result of this and other improvements, we are confident of a material and sustainable improvement to production in the next two quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 442.72-450.51: We expect this higher production to drive the cost per ounce lower, and I'm looking forward to visiting the operation again with Laurie in the next few weeks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 452.29-458.36: Frustratingly, Mungare remains the only asset in our portfolio that we cannot currently visit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 459.24-464.36: We are fortunate to have a good team in Western Australia who have led the Kandana integration, which has gone well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 464.74-469.29: And we are growing increasingly confident about the future and the potential of this operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 470.95-476.72: Mount Rordan was impacted by heavy rainfall and was forced to process the low-grade stockpile material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 477.62-490.65: Strategically, we continue to assess the potential of Mount Roridon to be converted into a pumped hydro generator, which could be a significant contributor of renewable energy to the southeast Queensland grid at the end of its mine life. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 492.47-501.70: This last quarter the highlights for the Discovery Team were good intersections at Kew in Western Australia and also more intriguing and exciting intersections at Red Lake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 501.72-506.63: Where there is plenty of open space and interesting geology to discover another high-grade zone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 507.71-511.93: Glenn and his team are also plotting and planning the next phase of drilling at Ernest Henry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.91-519.62: Whilst we are managing industry headwinds, we should not ignore the significant commodity price tailwinds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 520.40-531.21: The gold price of over $2,500 Australian dollars and a copper price which going forward will represent around 20% of our revenue of over $13,500 Australian dollars per tonne. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 532.23-539.70: Evolution is well positioned to benefit from this. I'll now hand over to Bob to provide some more detail on the operational performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 541.50-543.20: Thanks Jake and good morning everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 544.58-553.29: The December quarter saw our TRIFF stabilise at 9.4, the highlight being a 35% reduction in the 12-month moving average at Mundarin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 554.77-559.40: The December quarter gold production is the first reported without Mt. Carlin's contribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.12-568.07: The quarterly goal of production was 148,000 ounces with a 5% improvement in the oil and sustaining cost to $1,347 an ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 569.27-572.95: Despite the challenges faced with above average rainform and COVID,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.97-579.78: Cal had a strong quarter delivering 60,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $998 an ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 580.00-584.16: And an operating mine cash flow, pre-capital, of $80.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 585.33-589.93: Capital investment ramped up at Cal with $60 million spent on major projects this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 590.57-595.98: This included $24 million on the IWL and $33.5 million on the underground development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 596.98-605.51: Underground development rates will ramp up in the March quarter with a second jumbo commencing in December. And the selection of the primary mining contractor is on track for the March quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 606.27-608.61: The project remains on budget and on schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.35-612.65: The IWL Stage 2 deposition has run smoothly throughout the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 613.83-622.54: Ernest Henry produced 21,000 ounces of gold and 4.1 thousand ounces of copper at an all-in sustaining cost of a negative $882 an ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 623.48-632.53: The high AISC compared to the September quarter is primarily driven by lower copper production due to lower mining planned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.55-634.77: Love our planned morning concert. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.16-641.88: The net mine cash flow remained strong at $79.5 million, another significant contribution to the portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.78-647.11: I'm pleased to say this will be the last quarter reporting Ernest Henry as an economic interest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 647.71-653.75: Integration activities are well underway and I'm excited to have the Ernest Henry team as part of the Evolution family. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 654.79-661.28: The pre-feasibility study for the mine extension below the 1125 RL has commenced and will incorporate the recent drilling results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 661.84-666.21: Indicating mineralization extends further than assumed in the concept study. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 667.23-670.57: Completion of the study is expected in H1FY23. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 672.35-682.12: Moving on to Red Lake, over the past five months, I've been on site three times. Each time I've seen improvement and step change in performance and delivery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 683.06-687.57: While they still work in progress, pleasingly, many key metrics are moving in the right direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 688.71-698.18: Red Lake produced 20,000 ounces for the quarter and although their oil and sustaining cost is not where we need it to be, the operating mine cash flow for the quarter was a positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 699.12-707.23: And we spent $13.9 million in sustaining capital and $36.9 million on major capital for future production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.91-711.83: For the past couple of quarters, I've been talking about development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.21-720.74: Pleasingly, during the December quarter, each month was above our long-term transformation goal of 1,200 metres per month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 721.86-729.69: The December quarter was 21% higher than the September quarter. I expect this to continue, allowing additional mining fronts to be opened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 731.03-739.40: Campbell Mill continues to achieve new records and approval has been granted to lift the daily throughput restriction of 2000 tonnes per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 739.42-744.36: For a limited trial in the second half of the financial year to support the Campbell Mill expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.75-749.53: I still don't know where we want them to be. There have been significant improvements through the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.39-752.71: The cycle time has improved by 25%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 753.49-762.44: Stove idle time has improved by 60%, time to drill per stove has improved by 27% and slot drilling has halved with the V30 implementation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 763.68-773.89: Stope extraction quality focused has delivered a 19% improvement in stope recovery, a 3% reduction in dilution and a 15% increase in our all mine to quarter and quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 774.73-780.42: And in December, the grade lifted to 4.9 grams per ton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 782.54-790.23: Looking forward to H2, we're expecting to see a continual improvement in delivery from the underground and the two mills operating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 791.29-799.42: Notable improvements for the second half of the year, tonnes processed will increase with the Red Lake Mill running and the Campbell Mill Rate Extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 800.42-807.89: Grade mind is lifting as dilution reduces and plans for early ore from the CYD development continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.91-816.56: Increased tons from Kozner, the transfer haulage locomotives performance has improved by 43% last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 816.58-820.98: And replacement locomotives will be commissioned this quarter, further reducing downtime. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.74-829.73: And increased number of mining horizons and continuing the improvement in stoke design and execution to further enhance our ore delivery and quality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 831.81-841.40: Mangare is moving forward post integration. For a quarter, they produced 34,000 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,829 an ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 842.14-845.83: And generate an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of $20.7 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 847.71-856.68: Oil grade process increased 34% over the last quarter as a proportion of underground oil in the feed increased from 54% to 67%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 857.68-861.88: Workforce integration is ongoing with a focus on establishing a one team approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 862.72-869.09: The sharing of resources across the field has commenced and enabling better deployment of equipment and resources to priority areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 869.11-875.44: Which has been critical as a site navigates high vacancy rates and COVID-related impacts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 876.72-885.35: Mount Rordan produced 12.4 thousand ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1842 an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of $11.9 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 886.41-891.73: As previously mentioned, weather significantly impacted access to the pit, resulting in reduced oil movements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 892.55-897.82: As a result, stockpile feed increased, directly affecting gold grade and production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 898.88-903.52: In summary, some great improvements made at Radley and Mungaree throughout the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 903.82-911.89: The Cowl Underground project continues to hit milestones and the official ownership of the Ernest Henry mine has added additional opportunities for the portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 912.73-919.80: Thank you for your time and I'll hand over to Glenn. Thank you Bob and good morning everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 920.86-923.58: Firstly, at our QJARN Fan Fair in Western Australia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 924.12-931.99: We've advised our partner Musgrave Minerals that we will be taking full management and operatorship of the project which occurred on January 1st of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 933.03-939.06: Recent results from diamond drilling at the West Island Prospect outlined on page 15 of this morning's report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 939.66-944.40: Importantly confirm the potential for high-grade mineralisation within individual loads. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 945.49-953.45: Drilling has also identified multiple new load structures in the favourable dolerite host in various locations along stripes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.59-963.34: The geometric relationships between structures and dolerite imply individual loads may be limited by their potential strike length but remain open at depth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 964.36-970.01: The Air Corps Drilling Program has been very important in further delineating the favourable dolerite host. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 970.03-975.24: Associated gold anomalism along strike from the original West Island drilling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 976.14-984.68: The results have unlocked new areas with the necessary geological ingredients for mineralisation to occur up to 5km from West Island. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 986.15-995.05: One of the challenges with all of our drilling programs is long delays waiting to receive assay results in time to inform where to drill next. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 996.44-1002.84: This is an industry-wide issue and is holding back the ability to accelerate drilling programs in the ways we would like to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1003.54-1012.55: At Kew, we are still waiting on results from five diamond holes and over 70 air core holes, which restricts our ability to sensibly add additional drilling resources. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1014.61-1022.84: At Red Lake, two deep holes were completed as wide space step-outs from the original intercept reported last quarter on the R Zone extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1023.74-1028.55: One of the holes intersected high grade mineralisation 200 metres away from the first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.57-1035.38: From the first hole with the other hole drilling through the structure however it did not return significant mineralization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1036.20-1045.99: The results reported on page 12 are encouraging because they unlock a large area of real estate that has not been previously drilled along the extension of the Arzone structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1046.83-1054.71: Follow-up drilling is currently stepping up the high-grade intercept in hole 69 to expand the potential scale of mineralisation in this area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.26-1067.97: At Mongaree, drilling underground at Kandana and East Kandana continues concentration on small resource extensions and classification upgrades on future mining areas adjacent to existing development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1068.99-1073.69: Step out drilling into the footwall of the K2 structure from the underground at Hornet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.71-1079.06: Has returned further promising intercepts of stacked load-style mineralization at Star Trek. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.12-1088.73: Follow up drilling is underway to understand the significance of the laminated vein in hole 2130 reported on page 14 of this morning's report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.69-1097.26: The geology is similar to what would be expected on the main K2 structure at RHP, which is where the priority follow-up drilling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.96-1106.33: At Ernest Henry, we have assessed H2 drilling priorities, which will be focused on developing ore body knowledge for the PFS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1106.35-1111.89: Along with de-risking areas of the resource that require additional data support before production is scheduled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1112.65-1121.82: As Bob and Jake mentioned earlier, strong copper-gold mineralisation has been intercepted at the 480 metre RL and remains open down plunge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1122.60-1124.24: With that, I'll hand over to Larry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1126.57-1134.15: Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll provide a brief update on the financial performance for the quarter as outlined on pages nine and 10 of the report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.10-1141.08: For the group we produced 148,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $13.47 per ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.82-1151.01: This aligns with our guidance where we said the production would increase over the year and the all-in sustaining costs would trend down from around $14.50 per ounce in the first quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.01-1156.20: The AISC was approximately 5% lower than the September quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1157.18-1159.68: Our focus on portfolio quality is evident. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.98-1168.85: In that on a like-for-like basis the divestment of Mount Carlton operation reduced our all-in sustaining cost by $28 per ounce this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1170.01-1176.98: As our production and cost profile changes in the second half, the cost benefit from this divestment will improve further. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.26-1188.93: Group production and cost guidance remain unchanged at 670,000 to 725,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $11.35 to $11.95 per ounce. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.43-1199.48: With the performance of Red Lake in the first half, we expect to be at the bottom end of the production range and in the top half of the cost guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1200.58-1206.07: In terms of cash flow, we were fairly well in line with plan, excluding the underperformance at Red Lake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.83-1214.77: We generated $203 million of operating cash flow, which is up 4.6% and 13% excluding Mt Carlton. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1215.90-1220.40: On a per ounce basis, our operating cash flow was up 10% quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1221.26-1229.99: This was against a flat gold price and lower copper revenue where the higher copper price was offset by planned lower copper volumes at Ernest Henrich. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.55-1236.32: Net mine cash flow was $53 million with our capital programs remaining on plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1237.06-1247.65: We invested around $34 million in sustaining capital, while major project investment increased to $114 million as projects at Cowell and Red Lake progressed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.69-1259.36: Group capital guidance remains unchanged at $150 million to $175 million for sustaining and $440 million to $505 million for major projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1260.68-1268.65: We'll see an immediate benefit of the acquisition of 100% of Ernest Henry, where AISC will reduce materially in the second half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1269.51-1272.51: More importantly though, our cash flow will be increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.39-1277.72: Based on our guidance and depending on the copper price achieved in the second half,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.74-1283.44: We expect to realise an additional $80 million to $130 million of net mine cash flow at Ernest Henry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1284.38-1287.77: This will be taken into consideration when determining our interim dividends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1289.09-1298.64: As previously announced, during the quarter we successfully priced the US $200 million US private placement for nine years at very attractive pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.66-1301.12: To partially fund the Ernest Henry acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.86-1303.46: This will be drawn down next month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1304.62-1309.91: We ended December with $1.15 billion of cash and net debt of $450 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.61-1317.42: Now, unordered gearing is around 12.6% prior to the payment for Ernest Henry in early January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1318.34-1323.86: We are on track to be below the 29% projected at time of announcing the acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.28-1329.63: And we expect to quickly be back within our targeted gearing levels and maintain a very strong balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.73-1335.54: I look forward to updating you next month on the FY22 interim financial results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1336.62-1341.08: Thank you for your time this morning and Darcy please open the line for questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.90-1349.09: Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.95-1357.16: If you wish to cancel your request, please press star 2. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1358.32-1363.04: Your first question comes from David Radcliffe from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.60-1366.41: Hi, good morning, Jake and team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1366.83-1374.45: My question is on Red Lake. The commentary around mining rates does seem more optimistic today, which is great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.12-1381.12: Especially with respect to, I guess, the mine efficiencies and dilution and opening up more mining crates up front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1381.48-1389.29: Just trying to think how we should think about the high development rates converting into higher mine tons over this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1389.43-1395.44: And if you could maybe provide some sort of quantum how that comes through over the next couple of quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1396.22-1400.62: And then on grade, how we should sort of think about those numbers over the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.96-1403.68: Obviously, there's going to be the sweet love from Campbell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1403.70-1411.85: But when do we, from the operations today, how do we move closer to that preserved grade of six given that currently it's in the four? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.63-1416.40: Thanks David, those are good questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1417.38-1423.68: And I think we are going through a transformation, we've called it a three to five year transformation at Red Lake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1424.66-1427.59: The last six months have taught us a lot about the operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1428.65-1430.75: We've focused on the development and we've. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.85-1433.55: We've specifically taken the decision to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.57-1440.16: I suppose sacrifice production over development and getting ready and setting the transformation up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.20-1445.93: And we now feel that we've kind of bottomed and we're at a point where you're really going to see improvements in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.85-1448.37: So the development rates are up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1448.57-1453.11: The improvements in mining are getting better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.13-1461.10: As Bob highlighted and he can talk further to it, dilution has been reduced. We're comfortable that the models are performing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.18-1466.93: We need to open up some of these higher grade areas which are going to be happening over the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.91-1472.25: So it's a journey. We're on the right path. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.85-1480.74: And you are going to see material improvements to production and lowering of costs in the next quarter and following quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1481.14-1485.79: Bob, do you want to add to that? Yeah, thanks, Jake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.27-1495.18: David, as Jake said, the expectation is that as we get the development into the new areas, and it takes a long time,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.20-1498.24: To go out and open up new areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1498.74-1503.06: Then the mining fronts will open up which will help stabilise and increase the tonnages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1503.86-1511.79: We've started to see an increase in tonnages last quarter through the quarter, although it's not as high as we need it yet, but it's still growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1513.63-1518.88: And areas like aviation and the like, they do take a bit of time to set up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1519.36-1524.16: I would expect that over the next couple of quarters, we'll start to see those tonnages come in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1525.43-1527.45: As Jake said also, on the grade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1528.49-1536.26: We are getting a lot better with the reconciliations of dilution and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1536.28-1538.58: And the like, as I mentioned, all the numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.24-1548.75: I expect that over the coming quarters we'll see that continue to improve. Greene, did you want to comment on the model specifically? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1552.01-1553.69: Sure Bob, I think... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1553.71-1563.84: One of the things that we're starting to see, David, is that particularly with our reconciliations, so our Dom to Grey control and our Dom to Reserve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.25-1567.71: We're starting to see an upward tick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1567.73-1577.38: Particularly on the grade front as we improve some of the mining related factors as Bob has just described, dilution, recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1577.78-1582.84: And we've improved our grade control system. So we are starting to see that upward tick in the grade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1583.42-1589.97: And particularly on a three month moving average, it's starting to trend into the direction where we need it to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.37-1598.74: We have confidence that the models are performing to plan and we're just aligning that with the way we're mining. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.08-1600.38: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1600.40-1604.80: We're confident that we'll start to see that where it needs to be over the next coming quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1606.03-1612.67: I just conclude that, David, with a comment around the fact that we've owned this asset for 21 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1613.17-1617.38: It's only been in the last five months that we've been able to visit the operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1618.12-1622.08: But when we bought the asset in April 2019, we said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1622.26-1626.61: Our three year goal was to get to a run rate of 200,000 ounces of gold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.85-1633.31: And then a longer term five year horizon of 350,000 ounces a year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.35-1637.08: And we are committed to delivering that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1637.24-1640.00: On both 36 month and 60 month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1643.30-1648.77: Much guys I'll pass it on. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.99-1652.29: Comes from Al Harvey from J.P. Morgan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1656.04-1665.35: Jason team just a couple from me just with Ernest Henry and the study so we've got about 18 months for the PFS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1666.49-1675.28: Just wondering if this is going to take on much of the work that Glencore did or if it'll be kind of a complete recut incorporating that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1675.78-1677.74: Those further depth extensions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.80-1682.00: I think, Glenn, you mentioned it was going down to 480 metres. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1682.02-1691.61: And still open beyond. So where potentially would you draw the line on those depth extensions and where this study will finish up? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.93-1702.60: Yes, so just to clarify, the study will be delivered in the second half of this calendar year, so first half of FY22. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1702.62-1705.23: So we kind of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.25-1708.71: Say nine months away from delivery of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.71-1715.62: It will build on the concept study which was completed by Glencore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1716.46-1721.30: I suppose one of the things which we found intriguing as we've looked at the concept study. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1721.94-1723.38: Is that it was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1723.40-1736.76: Determined really on the basis of minimizing the capital expenditure, which meant that the depth extent of the concept study went down to as far as the decline could go and you could truck material up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1737.58-1743.24: That wasn't constrained or determined by geology, it was more determined by. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1743.30-1749.85: How far can we develop, how deep can we develop, which is kind of a 45 year mine life extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1749.87-1761.98: With a decline development and not needing to spend significant capital. So the priority was really minimizing capital expenditure and extending mine life. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1762.00-1766.71: By which constrained it to that 45 years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.73-1769.51: Our pre-feeds will look at that as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1769.99-1776.00: But it will also look at some longer dated options as to whether there is potential to extend it even further beyond that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1776.54-1781.76: Which certainly from my site visit there was a lot of optimism from the site team that that was possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1785.87-1789.73: Thanks Jake. Maybe just quickly on Red Lake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1790.31-1800.24: You got the approval for the high throughput trial, how long will that trial last and then what are the permitting steps that will follow? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1802.22-1805.29: Bob, do you want to take that question? Yes, thanks Al. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1806.41-1815.10: The trial is actually permitted for a six to eight week period of basically unlimited throughput through the Campbell Mill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1815.78-1823.18: And the reason we wanted the trial was to determine how far we could actually push the mill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1824.20-1833.99: So really it's a short period of time that will allow us to then be able to go and actually seek the approvals for a permanent lift. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1834.93-1836.96: At the moment you need an engineering study. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1837.48-1845.25: And we actually believe that we can actually get all the data we need out of this trial to be able to go and actually seek the permitting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.51-1856.56: Bob and if I could just sneak one more in just with cow there was a small contribution from the underground this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1857.14-1860.06: I thought we were going to expect that a little bit lighter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.18-1868.89: Is this material a one-off or can we kind of expect underground to start contributing more and seeing that ramp up over the next few quarters? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1874.43-1879.74: We're on track for the time frame that we've actually spoken about earlier, Al. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.26-1887.65: There will be minor contributions coming through as we develop through different zones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1888.55-1892.17: But it won't be significant in the immediate future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1893.05-1898.30: But we're on track to deliver first door, as we said. I'm just trying to remember exactly the time frame. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.26-1903.20: I can't remember, sorry. I'll have to check it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.82-1912.09: Jake? I don't think there was any contribution or material contribution from the underground. It remains on track and on schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.91-1918.06: No worries. Thanks Jake and Bob. Cheers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1921.94-1926.75: Thank you. Your next question comes from Daniel Morgan from Barron Joey. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1928.17-1937.40: Hi Jack and Tim. Just on Red Lake, can you just run through on why FY22 guidance is still achievable, albeit at the low end of the ranch? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.00-1944.18: It does imply the next two quarters have got a very strong production run rate of over 50,000 ounces. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.76-1948.01: I guess we're at the end of January, so you should have visibility on that data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1949.35-1959.24: It just seems a big lift. What is underpinning that? Do you have high-grade stopes available? Is it running this trial of the plant? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.26-1961.04: Does that give you more production? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.36-1962.90: And how is gardens achievable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1963.70-1968.25: Yeah, Dan, thanks. I mean, we've specifically said that group guidance is achievable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.43-1972.71: We're not going to make the asset guidance at Red Lake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.39-1975.90: But we're not feeling... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1976.40-1985.87: That we want to be granular enough to say how much we can produce because all these steps are in place and are showing improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.53-1993.75: But on a group basis, and I think that's what investors should look at, we are confirming that we will make our guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1995.24-1999.12: I might have misinterpreted the comment that it was a group comment. Apologies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.06-2002.14: Just on red light, maybe taking a step back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2003.04-2005.02: Could you maybe break out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2006.07-2013.49: What are the critical elements that need to be in place for the turnaround to occur? Because obviously a lot of these are not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2013.51-2021.32: Current, whether that's equipment, access to the upper Campbell, or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.34-2022.76: Or the melt through positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2022.82-2030.69: Can you just unpick when these pieces to the turnaround will be in place or expected to be in place and when we can expect that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.59-2036.28: Bob, you've just recovered from jet lag from your latest trip there, so over to you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.48-2040.90: Thanks Jake and thanks Dan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2043.42-2048.21: As we talked about earlier, the big one to start with was getting the development to open up new areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2049.93-2054.89: But post that, we've actually been working on this type of turnaround cycle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2056.24-2058.88: And the time to initial... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2058.90-2062.58: From initial development through to filling of a stoke. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2062.68-2070.95: So we're going to keep the sequence going for the next scope which comes along right beside the previous field scopes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2071.91-2080.12: So we've been working on long-held drill rates, we've been working on pace fill, placement, we've been working on re-entry times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2080.16-2085.21: As well as stoping and turnover of the actual stoves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2085.73-2088.23: So all those together is really... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.25-2095.98: Is what is enabling the lift last quarter of our ore tons by I think it was about 15% from the previous quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2097.08-2102.00: But that comes around because we can actually get into the studs quicker and more regularly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.00-2110.17: If we actually look at the additional mining fronts, what it enables us to do is actually spread the mining fleet out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2110.93-2120.48: So that interruption and disruption from interacting activities is limited even further. So that allows us to actually... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2120.50-2125.69: Turn the actual cycles quicker because we actually don't have the same disruption factors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.29-2129.75: A big one for coming quarters is Cochner. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2130.47-2140.44: And last quarter, the high speed tram or the locomotive that takes the ore from Cochina across to Reach Heart. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2140.88-2143.48: That improved significantly from the previous quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.14-2153.77: And that is one of the main things that allow us, because Koshner has got a good turnover cycle of its stubs already. Did I sort of try to answer it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.94-2160.56: When is access coming to the Upper Campbell from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2164.50-2167.01: So, we're... Sorry, Dad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.85-2171.47: I was just going to say the upper Campbell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2172.23-2180.16: So the CYD is actually accessing the upper Campbell. And we're already down into that area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2180.18-2181.54: With the CYD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2182.50-2189.13: The first stoke ore was always said to be around about 12 months after, and that still is on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2190.59-2199.58: We will get minor amounts of development or earlier. The same as at Kel, as you go through areas you'll intercept some minor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2201.30-2206.07: All zones, but anything from a start will still be within that 12 months from first starting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2206.85-2207.87: Check if you don't have anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2209.41-2218.58: No, other than that you were walking around it last week and you felt positive about the outlook over there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.52-2227.87: I suppose the thing that I would add to all this commentary on Red Lake is that each time someone's been there, and particularly Bob, who's made several trips. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2229.01-2233.53: There are no red flags with respect to our delivery of this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2233.55-2240.54: Our operational efficiency better down. I still believe this is, as I said in my commentary,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.22-2246.63: This is an amazing commercial opportunity where we've acquired assets that need transformation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2247.49-2256.18: It's going to take some time. We've had a few hiccups in the last six months, but there are no red flags with respect to delivery and transforming this operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2257.88-2264.76: I guess Jake on that comment about the ore tonnages or the potential ore within that Campbell zone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2265.81-2270.53: Daniel, I walked 9, 11, 14 and a few other levels this time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2270.97-2276.96: And it's right for the taking. It's just the access we've got to get there. So that's what's taking the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2278.82-2283.74: Thank you. And last question is probably a bit simpler, just Mungari. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.70-2287.11: Just the numbers on page four. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2287.55-2296.86: I was going to confirmation on whether these are equity numbers or or do they have JV production in them? I just want to make sure I'm treating like with like here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2298.92-2299.92: Sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2300.06-2306.95: Dan, so the physicals up the top will be 100% of what's processed when we're talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2306.97-2311.91: Gold production, silver production, that is our equitable share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2312.87-2318.12: So we're wanting to show what the actual mining and processing has been able to do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2324.78-2329.79: Thank you. Your next question comes from Levi Spry from UBS. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2333.13-2341.40: G'day, happy new year. Thanks for the call. Can I just follow up on Dave and Dan's questions there around Red Lake? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2343.06-2346.11: Bob, can we get the tonnes and grades for the second half? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2346.19-2357.08: Do I assume that the three year 200,000 ounces means that we're going for a 50,000 ounce per quarter run rate in 12 months or whatever it works out to be? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2358.76-2362.62: I think before Bob answers that, I'll have a good Happy New Year leave. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2364.44-2373.99: Yes is the answer to your last question. To get to 200,000 ounces we need to get to consistently doing a run rate of 50,000 ounces per quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.64-2384.38: We'd prefer not to kind of break down into tons and grades for the next six months because we just feel we want to build confidence ourselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2384.40-2389.01: On a group guidance basis, we are comfortable, we'll make the guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.43-2393.67: But would prefer just to give us another couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2394.07-2400.36: To just get comfortable that these changes that we're seeing are going to be repeated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2400.38-2409.09: And consistently deliverable. Yep. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Jack. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.13-2417.18: Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.10-2422.26: First, a quick one at Cal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2422.68-2429.29: It seems like sustaining capex is running a bit low on an annualized basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2429.35-2432.73: Is there a reason for that or should we be expecting a lift in the second half? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.89-2440.02: Yeah Alex it is just basically timing more than anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.46-2447.85: We expect that their second half will lift. The primary focus in the first half was getting the underground. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2447.91-2454.29: The IWL projects continuing and in the second half you'll see some sustaining capital come through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.42-2467.93: So, for the second quarter, can we confirm that there was no grade reconciliation issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.35-2473.83: Yeah, there was dilution but that was improving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.93-2485.27: In the month of December we felt very comfortable that we'd addressed some of the issues that we were getting in terms of both dilution and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2485.29-2488.73: And we feel confident that the models are performing to plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2489.91-2493.69: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I was sort of talking about the model, but you've answered me there. Thanks very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2497.56-2502.32: Your next question comes from Matthew Friedman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2504.16-2505.83: Sure, thanks. Morning Jake and team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.57-2510.73: I don't want to labor the point on Red Lake and you did kind of just touch on it there, Jake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.79-2518.66: I'm just wondering, you've highlighted on the call and in the report a number of ways that tonnes are improving and volumes are improving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.70-2520.90: We can see mining rates lifting, development rates lifting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.28-2523.04: But obviously grade keeps falling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2523.50-2526.43: You've been underperforming the reserve grade for a year now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.93-2529.75: I guess, does that mean we'll see an overperformance at some point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2530.43-2539.60: Is there a need to rethink some of the dilution assumptions and other factors that underpin that reserve grade? You said you're comfortable with the way the model is performing at the moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2539.72-2542.36: I guess there's another year of data on this asset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2542.58-2548.47: Now I guess lead to any sort of expectations or anything that we should think about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.49-2553.55: At the next mineral resource or reserve update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2553.95-2556.92: Anything to think about in terms of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2558.00-2565.37: Yes, thanks Matt. I mean, good question again. And Bob and his team have been doing a lot of work on understanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.41-2571.67: That and again we came to the we are of the view empirically that the models are performing to plan but Bob. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2571.77-2579.44: Maybe you can give some colour as to some of the issues and then hand over to Glenn to just give some guidance on the MRI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2580.46-2582.02: Yeah, no problems going, Matt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2583.46-2588.01: The number that I quoted when I was speaking, that was the December number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2588.39-2597.00: So the number in the report is an average for the quarter of 3.95 and in December it did lift to 4.9. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2597.46-2604.68: Which is starting to show out some of the dilution issues that I spoke about being under control. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.39-2612.71: It's also showing some improvements in drilling accuracy and the like within the stopes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2613.01-2618.84: It's actually starting to improve significantly. And that's why what Jake said about we're pretty confident on the models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2619.70-2627.49: Are we working on all those things? Are we where we need to be? I still think we've got improvements to be had, so I still think that there's further uplifts to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2628.53-2632.53: But it is actually all moving in the right direction. So it's pretty, pretty pleasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2634.03-2635.78: Do you want to comment on the model? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.08-2639.16: Thanks, Bob. Yeah, Matt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2640.38-2649.97: Just a really I guess a bit of a preview on our MRLR update which will come out with mid next month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2651.37-2660.54: As you'll recall, when we did the evolution update to bring it into compliance with JORC,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2662.02-2667.75: We consolidated the models from over 130 to 19 principal models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2668.53-2670.49: In the last 12 months,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2671.15-2676.36: We've had new data and mining from six of those models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2676.38-2683.00: So they are the ones that we're going to be revising into the MRLR annual update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2683.64-2691.79: We're not seeing any material movement in the resource and that's from a Tung's End grade perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2691.85-2697.46: And assuming that the same cut-off grades as we previously had which is around about three and a half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2698.04-2701.44: Grams per ton on a mineral resource basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2702.98-2711.51: The new data that we're collecting is really confirming some of the geological interpretations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2712.37-2717.78: There are some small changes, there'll be swings and roundabouts in areas where we didn't have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2717.80-2722.48: As much data support as we would have liked, but that's to be expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2722.94-2728.53: So I think all in all, we're not expecting to see any material change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.93-2736.60: Year over year in terms of the actual geological model and how it informs the resource estimate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2737.88-2746.05: And I think from sort of looking at this in a great amount of detail, Bob and his technical team and Glenn and the resource. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2747.33-2754.63: We are confident that we are addressing the mining issues and with good mining practice. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2755.26-2758.06: We should be able to get the grade that is in the models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2760.70-2763.16: Got it. Thanks Jake and thanks for the context Glenn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2764.66-2780.00: Just secondly, on Ernest Henry, and obviously congrats to the team on closing that transaction over Christmas and the New Year. I hope they did manage to get some kind of a holiday. But just wondering, in terms of, you mentioned that the copper production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2780.04-2786.77: During the quarter was a bit lower than... Sorry, the lower copper production during the quarter was, I guess, to plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2787.33-2790.85: And potentially that's attributable to lower grades quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2792.91-2796.08: That asset is still mining above reserve grades, the copper in particular. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2796.10-2803.32: Just wondering when we should be thinking about a roll-off back to reserve grades for that asset? Did we see that in the December quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2804.34-2810.67: And then, I guess similar to the last question, anything to think about in terms of incorporating that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2810.69-2816.52: Reserve and resource into your next update, now that that's being reported on a 100% basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2816.58-2823.10: I believe it's already a JORC standard resource, but yeah, any movements there to think about now that it's fully evolution ownership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2826.59-2828.89: And do you want to just comment on the resource? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2831.27-2841.18: Yeah, sure Jake. So on the resource Matt, we will be providing an update mid next month which will incorporate information. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.56-2851.15: Up until about May last year, which will be when Glegcor did their last resource update. So there will be an update reflecting that point in time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2851.47-2858.14: It won't incorporate all the drilling information that we've collected between May and December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2859.32-2866.47: So that will obviously be rolled into our MROR cycle as we go ahead, you know, this 12-month period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2867.13-2872.47: To really incorporate all that information in addition to the new drilling that will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2873.33-2874.99: That is in the plan for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2877.96-2885.67: Matt just on the production, it was a combination. In the quarter we had a shutdown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2885.81-2890.35: Which was a planned shutdown and also a shutdown in the mine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2890.89-2899.82: So we did end up with some lower grades coming through and as we look at the rest of the year, you do see that the average grade being mined. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2900.92-2904.24: Is coming back down, certainly from where the first quarter was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2904.76-2910.85: And the second thing that did impact on copper in this quarter were some finalisations of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2910.87-2915.14: Of the previous quarter's concentrate sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2915.60-2918.92: So that did have a bit of an impact on the copper piece in particular. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2919.54-2921.24: So what you'll see... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2921.42-2929.89: If you look at it as a half, you're going to see that then flow through into the second half as a pretty well a light for light. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2931.83-2935.42: Once you gross it up to 100% obviously. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2937.36-2940.40: Right, got it. Thanks Laurie and thanks for the comments Glenn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2944.36-2948.97: Thank you. The next question comes from Mitch Ryan from Jeffries. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2950.37-2953.07: Good morning all. Thank you very much for taking out the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2953.61-2962.32: A quick question with regards to Red Lake, but more of a longer term question. Just wondering if you could provide an update on Battle North and their acquisition there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2962.34-2964.28: Specifically around the milling capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2965.49-2969.87: Part of the rationale for that was to potentially bring that capacity online. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2970.51-2979.40: Can you give us an update on the permitting processes for that? How much attention is actually being able to be spent on that given the focus on just, I guess, consolidating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2980.00-2982.54: Base level of production in the existing Red Lake operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2984.66-2992.49: Bob over to you. Yeah thanks. The Battle North processing plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2994.77-3004.02: It's there, it's operational if we wanted to start it. We are replacing some parts that need replacing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3004.50-3009.27: The big issue at the Bateman plant is the TSF and we're working through that at the moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3010.65-3012.77: So the next sort of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3012.81-3014.57: 12 odd ish months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3014.59-3023.70: Our capacity at Red Lake and Campbell are going to be enough, so that's what we're doing, the permitting and all the work to bring it in on time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3023.72-3025.53: When we actually made it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3027.31-3036.14: From the rest of Battle North, we're still doing work in the underground. We're doing some drilling that Glenn could talk about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3037.02-3039.26: So we've done some great control drilling over there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3039.80-3042.78: Just to gather our knowledge on your bodies as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.03-3055.22: Your next question comes from Stuart McKinnon from The West Australian. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3057.02-3058.08: Oh, good day, Jack and Shane. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3059.02-3071.57: I was just intrigued by the mention in the quarterly about up to 15% of your workforce being effectively knocked out at Red Lake and Cow at various times because of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3073.31-3081.44: Obviously, you know, COVID hasn't been sort of awash in the community as it has in those other places, Canada and New South Wales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3081.46-3083.64: In WI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3083.68-3089.57: That eventually you're going to have the same challenges at your WA operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3089.59-3094.21: In terms of COVID and managing the workforce as you do at Red Like and Cal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3094.53-3099.28: And how much or more of an impact is that going to be given that you're already sort of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3099.30-3107.51: Short on workers given the WI situation with the labour market shortage just generally in the resources industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3109.49-3111.37: That's a good question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3112.21-3116.16: Look, we're obviously watching it and monitoring it very closely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3117.38-3126.49: And trying to put in the contingency plans and the learnings which we've got from managing it, and we've managed it effectively at Red Lake and Cowl. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3127.79-3132.37: But unless there is some sort of a consensus,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3132.71-3135.88: Someone finds a cure for COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3135.90-3143.14: Which does not seem to be the case because people who are triple VAC still seem to be catching the Omicron variants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3143.16-3146.85: In New South Wales and Canada and around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3147.55-3151.95: Then you'd have to think that at some point in time if Western Australia opens up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3152.67-3161.58: Omnicron is going to spread through Western Australia. So we are going to do our best to put in contingency plans, but if you couple that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3161.80-3163.82: A skill shortage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3164.34-3170.37: It does put the whole mining industry in Western Australia at some risk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3173.35-3174.37: Thanks for that, Joe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3178.48-3183.28: Thank you. Your next question comes from Nick Evans from The Australian. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3186.99-3189.51: I'm sorry about that. Just tell me my fine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3190.43-3197.42: I'm just a follow-up to his question, Jake. In terms of New South Wales in particular,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3197.90-3202.60: How are you thinking about the spread of pharmacons in New South Wales? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3202.62-3213.59: Think that Cal or your operations there have seen the worst of it? Or were you expecting this kind of level of absenteeism to continue for some time? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3214.11-3223.08: Just in terms of WA, I thought I detected a sort of a note of frustration in your voice when you talked about not being able to visit it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3223.38-3225.21: Do you think that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3225.23-3237.82: In terms of dealing with the inevitable split in WA, should the state government have bitten the bullet and done it now or do you think there was some benefit to delaying the reopening in WA? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3240.26-3243.12: Thanks, Nicola. I'll answer the second question first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3243.54-3250.59: Our preference would have been to have the Western Australian border opened earlier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3252.25-3261.38: It just seems like you're in some ways deferring the inevitable by keeping it closed, as I said earlier, unless there is a cure, which is not on the horizon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3262.48-3270.17: It is going to be present and it is going to have to be dealt with at some point in time, even if it is deferred, it's not going to be eliminated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3270.99-3280.00: It does feel like other places like New South Wales and Ontario and the rest of the world is learning how to manage this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3280.86-3284.56: And certainly at our operations, while it has been a big distraction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3285.17-3286.99: We have been able to manage through it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3287.81-3292.71: And we are getting more comfortable that we can manage it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3293.61-3295.14: It has. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3295.18-3304.44: Distracted the management teams a lot but with proper process and proper protocols it can be managed effectively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3311.67-3316.12: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Pollock from... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3317.66-3323.76: Go ahead. Yes. Good morning, everybody. And thanks, Jake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3325.33-3333.69: I think it was you who said in your introduction that the second half of the financial year would be materially better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3334.53-3342.96: I was just wondering where we can expect to see material improvements in which operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3344.12-3345.63: Yeah, Jim, I think, thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3346.83-3354.23: There are two areas which I'd say you should look out for. The one is Red Lake that we've spoken about at length on this call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3355.24-3360.20: We expect to see a material improvement in production and reduction in costs over there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3360.68-3370.67: And the second one is the acquisition of Ernest Henry will be fully incorporated into our results on a 100% basis from the 1st of January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3371.19-3372.95: And that will also have a material impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3375.50-3385.47: I wasn't going to ask, well, I thought I'd be a little bit different and not ask any questions on Ernest Henry, but thanks for including that answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3386.47-3393.83: Given the uh... The rain problems you've had in in new south wales and queensland. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3395.28-3400.00: Just for example, at Mount Rorton, what. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3400.48-3405.91: What tonnage of low-grade material do you have stockpiled that you can keep the mill running on? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3407.37-3411.47: I think we have very significant low-grade stockpiles. That's not the issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3411.59-3418.06: The issue is more we want to access the more profitable lower cost ounces in the pit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3420.08-3426.47: Right, but if you had to depend on, this is a hypothetical question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3426.77-3434.75: If you had to depend 100% on stockpiled material, you have many years ahead of you, I assume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3434.81-3436.88: Uh... Many years like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3437.46-3440.00: Yes we do. Right, okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3442.20-3446.07: Whatís the situation at Cowell? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3447.21-3450.21: Yes, very large stockpiles there as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3451.03-3459.66: That's what we're treating before we got into the stage H cutback which we're now treating all grade materials so very comfortable there as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3460.78-3468.13: Finally, I've been asked to ask you what's your best way of contacting you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3469.15-3476.24: Dr. Sandra Close did attempt to, well did try to contact York, did contact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3476.26-3484.72: The office before Christmas but got no reply. What's the best way of her getting something to you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3485.43-3489.71: I think if you go through the website, we will respond to it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3492.35-3500.06: Right, good. Okay, fine. That's me. Thanks very much. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3500.56-3505.00: Your next question comes from Anthony Barrett from S&P Global. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3506.61-3520.18: You mentioned earlier on about some of the headwinds that seem to be front of mind. Just wondering, just for the gold sector, how much are they front of mind in the context of what's going on in the bigger picture? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3520.20-3524.46: I'm not expecting any crystal balling for the gold sector or anything here, but.
