asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 6.07-14.63: Hello and welcome to the 9 month 21 EDPR results call. My name is Courtney and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 15.36-21.96: Please note that this call is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be on listen only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 22.36-25.85: However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 26.47-32.47: This can be done by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad to register your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 33.23-39.64: If you require assistance at any time, please press star zero and you will be connected to an operator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 40.08-43.12: And I will now hand you over to your host, Andre Farnam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 43.14-50.57: Head of Investor Relations, Planning and Control and Sustainability to begin today's conference. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 53.83-59.88: Good afternoon everyone. Thank you very much for attending EVPR's third quarter 2021 results conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 60.52-65.65: We have here with us our CEO, Miguel Stilwell-Dendraz, and our CFO, Juite Sheira. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 66.25-71.33: Who will run you through the key highlights of the business plan execution and of the nine month results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 72.07-75.34: We'll then move into Q&A in which we will be taking your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 76.00-82.64: This call is expected to last around one hour. And I'll now give the floor to our CEO, Miguel Celoso Andrade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 84.56-86.57: Thank you, Andrea. Good afternoon, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 87.19-96.78: I hope you're all doing well. It's also a pleasure to be on these calls and be able to not only present what we've been doing, but also take your questions afterwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 97.82-99.94: So anyway, today we have a lot to talk about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 100.16-108.81: So I'll get straight into the presentation. We move to slide five and just giving you a broad overview of the business plan execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 109.67-117.62: First of all, in the key pillars of growth. We are ramping up and we have around 2.5 gigawatts added year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 117.80-125.79: So this is good progress towards the 3 gigawatt plus which we were aiming for in the 2021 to 2023 growth targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 126.47-130.51: So this is actually the largest number of megawatts ever built by EDP renewables in 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 131.17-138.80: And I really like to highlight that this shows that there is a successful ramp up of the growth rate and it should give us confidence on the execution of the growth plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 140.04-145.33: Also today, we just announced the acquisition of Sunseep. You will have seen that news, I'm sure, this morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 145.97-148.85: I think it establishes a great platform in Asia Pacific. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 149.59-158.50: This is a region, and Iíll talk a little bit about this later on, but itís a huge growth potential in the region. So thatís something I think thatís worth also highlighting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 159.84-161.02: On secured capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 161.30-168.29: We now have 8.1 gigawatts secured, out of which 7.9 gigawatts in 2021 to 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 168.67-172.31: So that's around 75% of our 2021 to 2023 target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.95-174.17: I think good progress there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 174.77-179.36: And we also have visibility on an additional 4.1 gigawatts of PPAs in our key markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 179.88-189.23: In which we are either shortlisted or currently under negotiation. So we will hopefully be giving good visibility on the rollout of those PPAs also in the next couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 190.59-199.14: So overall, solid ramp up of growth, a good platform for growth in Asia Pacific, and also strong execution with short term visibility on the additional PPAs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 200.78-204.42: On the acid rotation program, so the pillar here in the middle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 205.09-209.95: We continue to see strong market appetite and attractive valuations, both for wind and solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 210.53-218.58: We have the 2.3 billion of asset rotation proceeds. Multiples continue to be very attractive, on average 1.6 million euros per megawatt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.02-221.20: 1.7 for wind and 1.2 for solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 221.70-224.26: So I'll go there in a little bit more detail in a minute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 225.15-233.21: As of September, we have 550 million of asset rotation proceeds, overall capital gains of 151 million, following the Mayflower earn out of 30 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 233.83-240.16: So overall, we're on track to deliver capital gains above the 300 million euros of guidance that we've given for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 240.88-249.83: And we have a couple of transactions which we've already announced but which we're hoping to close over the next couple of weeks or months, but hopefully at least one or two by the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 251.37-260.46: On excellence, which is the third pillar, so for the nine months to date, EDP renewables has achieved 28% load factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 261.34-264.32: This is down 0.6% year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 264.70-269.37: But it still reflects 95% of the expected gross capacity factor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 270.47-280.32: We have had a bad year in terms of wind. I mean, low resource, particularly in the US and Spain. And I think that's something that we've talked about in previous quarters, and the third quarter was no exception. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 281.52-288.03: Regarding operations, we continue with a strong performance with core op-ecs per megawatt decreasing 3% year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 288.67-298.44: And on the technical side, we continue to deliver a good availability of 97%, so slightly above year on year. So in terms of operations, I think good performance there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 299.24-308.47: On EFG, execution is well on track for the business plan targets. We have already most of the initiatives already in progress under the Changing Tomorrow Now program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 309.81-313.91: And finally, I mean, just on a note, it's not here on the slide, but... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 313.93-320.06: We have an EBITDA of 917 million euros, net income of around 150 million, 148 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 320.78-323.84: This is mostly impacted by the lower capital gains year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.72-333.59: The first quarter one-off ERCOT event and lower generation or lower wind in the US and Spain. I think that's something we have to recognize. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 333.99-342.14: So it hasn't been a great year from a wind resource perspective. And overall, the high pool prices in the third quarter has also introduced some pressure on the hedges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 343.16-351.17: In Spain in particular, the Ibex is 42, 45 million below expectation in the nine months, 30 million of which is from low wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 351.33-355.16: Especially in the second and third quarter, which is below the P50. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 355.74-362.56: And then you have around $10 to $15 million from financial hedges in the third quarter, given the high prices combined with low generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 363.22-367.93: So I'll go through this in more detail, and we will also elaborate more on this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 369.63-371.67: Anyway, let's move forward to slide six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 373.41-380.18: So here, on the growth platform for Asia-Pacific that we in the Sunseed transaction we announced today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 380.82-386.59: So as you know, we had 20 gigawatts of additions until 2025 set out in the strategic plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 387.19-391.71: 1.4 gigawatts we outlined or highlighted will come from your market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 392.93-402.78: These new geographies do bring us optionality. They bring diversification to our portfolio. And so the expansion into Asia-Pacific was something we'd been working on now for a while. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 403.68-405.83: I think today's news is certainly good news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 407.17-411.95: We move to slide seven, just talking a little bit about the overall Asia Pacific market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 412.63-414.91: It's one of the largest renewables markets globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 415.52-418.30: It has strong growth expectations, especially in solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 419.16-425.49: We're talking about 120 gigawatts per year in terms of growth. So it's a massive market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 425.57-431.37: At EDP Renewables, we really felt it was important to tap this opportunity and have a foothold in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 450.91-454.83: Standby whilst we re-establish the connection with our speakers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 670.13-675.18: Thank you for your patience, please stand by whilst we re-establish the connection with your home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 716.80-721.36: Patient, the connection has been re-established. Speakers, please continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 723.22-728.29: OK, so sorry for the technical difficulties. I mean, I think this is the first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 729.67-738.20: I'm told that we somehow got disconnected around side seven, so I'll resume on side seven. Hopefully you haven't heard that before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 739.82-747.81: So I'll just go back to slide seven and talk about Asia Pacific. So this is really one of the largest markets globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 748.19-751.59: It's got huge growth expectations, especially in solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 752.39-759.30: And some key numbers which I think are worth highlighting, 120 gigawatts per year market, so it's really a massive market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 760.00-765.83: 55% of the global growth in renewables, and solar represents 65% of this growth in Asia Pacific. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 766.73-777.80: Also something which I'm sure everyone will be familiar with, which is, I mean, this is a highly populated, densely populated region. So it's over 4 billion people and over 50% of the global power demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 778.58-786.21: And finally, just to say that countries like China, Japan, South Korea, they've all committed to net zero emissions by 2050 or 2060. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 786.81-793.29: And so there does seem to also be a general trend towards decarbonization in the region and promoting renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 794.27-796.12: And so just a final message on this slide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 796.58-805.47: If we are serious about reaching net zero by 2050, and there is a broad consensus around this, then all regions and all countries will need to contribute to this target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 805.97-812.17: And so we want to make sure that EDP Renewables is positioned in the long run to take advantage of this opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.65-820.16: I think I'd just like to highlight this in relation to this region, which is obviously I think key to making us global. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 820.92-827.55: And that's exactly the topic of the next slide. So, CIDATE, with this platform, we now become truly global. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 828.17-836.72: So we already had a very strong platform in the US, very strong platform in Europe. We have a good platform in Latin America with Brazil, Chile, Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 837.28-839.72: And now we set up this platform also in Asia Pacific. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.78-847.09: So we think that Sunsteep's team is very complementary to EDPR, both geographically and technologically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 848.35-857.36: Their footprint, solar pipeline, together with our scale and our capabilities, the fact that we have, for example, wind that we can also bring to the table. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.00-863.00: That means that we believe we will be able to build out the platform and accelerate the growth in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 864.46-873.43: So now having once we complete the acquisition, we'll be present in 25 markets representing 75% of global growth over the next decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 873.57-877.54: So that's, you know, we'll have a very strong representation in all the key markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 879.94-883.30: Moving to slide nine and a specific comment on SUNSIB. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 884.22-893.73: So it is a solar focused platform. It is based out of Singapore, present in nine markets, 550 megawatts of operating and under construction assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 894.25-899.38: Most of these in Singapore with a very low risk profile, as you know, Singapore is AAA rating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 900.30-907.61: Sunseek is also present in Vietnam, where EDPR is also present, so we'll be able to integrate our positions there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 908.69-918.04: Very young assets below 2 years, 20-year contracted revenues, so 76% of that PPAs and 24% regulated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 918.58-921.60: At an average price of 75 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 921.82-927.83: So low risk, stable, long-term cash flows completely aligned with the EDPR strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.55-933.25: Also, they bring very strong client relationships and attract records. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 933.89-941.28: The offtakers include some of the EDPR clients in Europe and in the US. So companies like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 941.30-948.77: So solar distributed generation represents around 70% of the operating and under construction portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 949.17-958.34: And it's a key technology, obviously, to grow in Asia-Pacific. Going forward, utility scale will also play a key and increasingly relevant role. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.38-967.07: So Sunseed brings a strong footprint in Asia Pacific, a great track record over 10 years of successfully developing the business there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 967.71-975.82: Got a fantastic management team with a lot of local knowledge, over 400 employees and growing given the growth of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 976.30-981.48: So that will facilitate the local culture know-how and also the long-term buildup of relationships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 982.06-988.51: So I think they have a great reputation in the region and I think that gives us a lot of confidence to leverage on that and accelerate growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 990.47-994.73: Also, very importantly, and moving to slide 10, Sunteep has a great pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 995.44-1003.90: So overall, the portfolio is around 5.5 gigawatts. So on top of the 550 megawatts of operating and the construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.40-1008.97: There are 130 megawatts of contracted capacity, so almost 700 megawatts of secured capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1009.71-1019.26: And we have a pipeline of almost five gigawatts in different stages of development, so around two gigawatts of advanced stage and 2.8 gigawatts of early stage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1020.78-1028.37: Future growth will have obviously more geographic diversification and also higher exposure to solar utility scale going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1030.47-1036.24: Moving on to slide 11, I'm talking just a little bit about valuations and stakes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.12-1044.94: So we are leveraging our capabilities to really accelerate the growth and the value creation in Asia Pacific through sun. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1045.77-1050.95: The way we see it, it's putting the business on steroids and really leveraging it up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.45-1058.20: We will have a 87% stake. This may actually increase to around 91%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1060.08-1068.85: Sunsteep has, as I mentioned, a great management team, so the founders will stay invested with around 6.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1068.91-1072.27: And with their incentives fully aligned with the growth and the profitability of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.03-1077.08: So I think this is a key point to make sure that we have a smooth transition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1077.30-1081.30: And we really bring the local experience and the new culture to EDPR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.32-1097.66: With obviously they have a great knowledge of the markets and the developments in the Asia-Pacific markets. And so we want to make sure that, you know, that we are able to merge the companies well and really leverage on Sunseed to take it even further and make it grow even faster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1099.20-1108.45: Together with the founders and the management, we will have around 94% that may actually increase to 98%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.83-1117.20: In terms of valuation, so the implied price we are paying is around 870 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1118.14-1124.36: Breaking this down, I'd say that there's one block, which is CAPEX, so implicit in that 550 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.21-1130.15: Since it's mostly solar distributed generation, it has an average capex per megawatt AC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.73-1135.38: So this is important to stress. This is AC, not DC, of around 1 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1136.86-1144.94: We have the value creation associated with the operating and the construction assets together with the secured capacity. So a total of 700 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1145.67-1149.19: And I'm sure you can come up with an NPV per mega reference for this package. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1149.79-1157.96: I just reemphasize that these assets are very young. They have 20-year contracted revenues and an average price of 75 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1158.78-1166.09: And finally, there's the pipeline and the platform, and we believe we'll be creating significant value from the existing pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1166.21-1175.54: And we'll be able to leverage the Fund Keep model. So with strong development capabilities in this footprint in nine markets to really deliver the growth going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.78-1179.88: Overall, for ADPR, it really opens up a new region of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1180.00-1186.95: Where we didn't have a significant presence. And we think that this together in terms of solar together with what we can bring in wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.05-1192.41: Will really mean that we can ramp up this platform, as I say, in the Asia-Pacific region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.91-1201.92: Okay, so that's Sunseep. I'd just like to now talk you through some of the other key metrics for the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.98-1211.59: If we move to slide 12, we have around 8 gigawatts secured, 8.1 gigawatts secured. So it's up 2.7 gigawatts year to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.51-1218.14: And I think that shows the origination capabilities and also the competitive projects that we're able to bring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1219.18-1225.27: If we zoom in just on 2021 to 23, as I mentioned earlier, we'll have around 7.9 gigawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1225.29-1229.73: Secured already until 23, so that's around 75%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.07-1238.80: We continue to have a disciplined investment approach. And so I think attractive returns, low risk profile, contracted NPV of around 60%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1239.32-1244.48: So we continue to see those metrics across the different projects that we are investing in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1244.86-1253.07: And so overall, strong visibility on the 2021 to 2030 time frame and also a solid risk return profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.04-1260.94: We move to slide 13. And this is something we've talked about previously, but just give you an update on this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1261.86-1270.57: So we continue to be protected from capex cost inflation, as we've discussed on previous calls, and we have limited exposure on 10% of our secured capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1272.19-1277.92: For new projects, we are seeing the PPA market and the auctions adjusting to the sector-wide increase in CapEx. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1278.58-1285.33: So from that perspective, it's not hindering our competitiveness when bidding for new projects. And the return thresholds are being preserved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.05-1294.29: So just to give you a specific example, for example, if you look at the Spanish auction now in October, you'll have seen that the average price of the auction went up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1295.70-1300.98: And that has to do, we believe, with adjustment also to the new CAPEX expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.56-1304.72: We are also seeing that when we are doing bilateral. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1304.74-1306.53: I'd say discussions on PPAs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.73-1315.36: Where we are seeing those prices feeding through into new PPA prices, revised PPA prices under discussion and being accepted by clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1317.16-1323.38: In relation to the supply chain, we have a strong position. We have a privileged relationship, I'd say, with the suppliers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1324.10-1329.25: And so we continue to monitor and to manage any disruptions that might happen to the supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.03-1337.60: In relation to wind, we feel comfortable. There doesn't seem to be any material issue with our project in the short and the medium term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1338.28-1348.71: In solar, something we're monitoring more closely, obviously to make sure that any disruptions are dealt with quickly and that we can manage that in the context of our development and construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1350.71-1358.96: If we move to slide 14 in terms of pipeline, we continue to ramp up. We have good short-term visibility on growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1360.32-1367.85: I wanted to highlight that 60% of the current secured capacity has been secured through PPAs. So that's a market where we continue to be very active. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1368.45-1371.01: And we actually expect it to increase even more over the coming years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1372.07-1381.00: So as I mentioned earlier, 4.1 gigawatts of PPA is under negotiation and shortlisted, which we hope will provide short-term visibility on additional capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1382.34-1392.01: Slide 15, on offshore ocean winds continues to grow, so operating capacity now 1.5 gigawatts in 2022, expected to reach 3.4 gigawatts by 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1393.01-1398.40: Maurice finalized construction. I had the pleasure of being up in Scotland. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.42-1404.10: A couple of weeks ago to just to inaugurate the O&M Center in Fraserburgh. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.61-1413.63: We're moving ahead also with some other projects in Scotland, so the Moray West. We're also expecting to get visibility on that soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1414.27-1419.28: We have several other projects that we are continuing to develop, Poland, US, South Korea. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1420.34-1426.25: We are participating in the RFP in Massachusetts for Mayflower. Hopefully we'll have visibility on that soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1427.15-1434.53: And also in relation to ScotWind, we'll also have visibility on that soon. So we have a good, strong presence in Scotland. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1435.10-1438.20: Let's wait and see what comes out of that auction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.40-1441.42: Slide 16. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1441.44-1450.79: Just a quick comment here on asset rotation, you'll have seen most of these numbers. So just very quickly 2.3 billion of proceeds 30% of the eight billion target for the full five year plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1451.59-1454.67: We're overall very happy with the multiples achieved in the execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1455.86-1462.04: Within the third quarter, we upsized the US transaction to 80%, and we also signed the Polish transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.18-1467.31: So clearly we are on track to deliver capital gains north of 300 million in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.99-1472.93: The actual value will depend on the timing of the regulatory approvals and the closing of each transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.73-1476.98: So all in all, execution on the after rotation going well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.44-1479.70: We continue to see strong appetite from investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.18-1488.87: And so now our efforts are totally on the regulatory approval side to make sure that we can get at least some of these over the line here by the end of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.77-1496.86: Slide 17, a quick note on ESG, so circular economy and biodiversity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1497.84-1505.27: We have been promoting a lot the waste recovery and the operational phase for a while. So extending our best practices now to the rest of the value chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1506.13-1509.19: Repowering, although it's still not very material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1509.45-1516.68: EDPR is focused on tackling the repowering wave that we expect post 2025, especially in Spain, Portugal, and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1517.42-1522.64: So far, we've done, we've repowered two wind farms in Spain, and we are repowering another one in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1523.84-1531.31: In the two sites that we repowered in Spain, most of the waste generated was recovered, so almost 95%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.13-1539.46: In this respect, we are participating also in some blade recycling projects in Spain, the U.S., and also in Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1539.48-1545.55: 100% of the area impacted during the repowering processes in Spain were fully restored. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.49-1547.77: In relations to communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1547.97-1558.90: We obviously want to make sure that we work with the local communities so that we are able to keep the alignment with our core business and make sure that we are able to develop our projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1558.92-1560.90: In harmony with the local communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1561.94-1562.96: In terms of people. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1563.86-1568.53: We are aiming to achieve 36% female employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.03-1576.38: Currently we're at 32%, but 37% of our new hires are all women, which contributes well to achieving our goal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.40-1579.16: Definitely looking out for equality of opportunities there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.20-1583.56: And lastly, just in relation to the sustainable suppliers goal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1583.94-1593.81: What we've been asking our core business suppliers is basically in terms of health and safety, environmental, ethical criteria to be totally aligned with us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1593.87-1603.46: So it's not just a question of EDPR having certain goals and targets. It's also making sure that that extends to our suppliers, at least our key suppliers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1604.44-1614.75: And with this business plan, as you know, we have the idea of going one step further by making sure that we have these ESG goals totally aligned with the suppliers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1615.98-1623.00: So I'll stop here, and I'll turn it over to Hui to walk you through the nine months results, and then come back at the end for closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.50-1628.95: Thank you. Thank you, Miguel. Good afternoon to you all. So let's move on to the nine-month result. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.99-1631.13: On slide 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.73-1638.06: Our financial performance year on year has been, as you know, mostly impacted by, on one hand, lower capital gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1638.64-1645.59: The one-off haircut event in Q1, and also the lower generation that we have been observing in the US and Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1646.15-1652.89: So we achieved a 917 million euros EBITDA and 148 million euros net profit in these first nine months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1653.77-1660.22: That's on the back of the generating 21.0 hours of clean energy. That's a 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1660.68-1663.60: So that's 122 million at net profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.22-1668.15: So on top of the 100 million gain on the U.S. Asset rotation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.65-1676.14: We have also some positive price adjustments from 2020 transactions in offshore and in this rosewater build and transfer project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1676.98-1679.70: Along with 30 million euros earned out from Mayflower. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1680.44-1683.40: Below EBITDA, we continue to improve our average cost of debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.52-1691.21: 3.4% versus 3.5% so that's a reduction of about 0.2 percentile points year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.55-1701.30: In the U.S., our top line is impacted by the Q1 one-off aircraft event. We extensively discussed this in the first quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1701.90-1705.19: But also by the fact that we are below the average resource. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.97-1709.77: For the period. We also have a weak wind resource in Spain as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1710.39-1719.06: And let me just highlight here some impact that we have in Spain that of course are hitting us in the nine month result. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1719.64-1727.03: So overall, Spain is about 40 to 45 million euros below our expectation for the 9 month 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1728.87-1738.42: Out of these three, around 30 million are from low winds. And that's particularly in the Q2 and Q3, where we have, you know, we are below the 90% of our P50. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1739.72-1747.23: And about 10 to 15 million euros from financial hedges in Q3, given the high prices and the low generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1747.79-1757.42: Just to give you an expected full year result from this impact with the P50 in terms of wind for the fourth quarter is around 25 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1758.44-1765.45: So I think it's also worth highlighting that given pull only went above the 60 euros per megawatt hour in July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1765.65-1774.67: The regulatory adjustment that is booked in the Q3 concentrates the regulatory adjustment for the full minor month of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1774.69-1775.90: So there is a concentration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1775.92-1778.50: To technicality, but there's a concentration here in the Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1779.58-1785.97: So just a snapshot in the balance sheet, net debt decreased here today to 3.32 billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1786.29-1789.25: This is, of course, on the back of the 1.5 billion capital increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1789.81-1793.95: Around 240 million asset rotation. So the equity proceeds from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.73-1804.54: And around 0.6 billion of the tax equity, which is already booked for the US projects. And of course, it impacts the net debt reduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1806.35-1811.71: I think it's important now that we can move to the operational side. So if you move to slide 20. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.95-1817.58: Highlighting that we added 2.5 gigas of wind and solar capacity year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1817.98-1822.42: This is the highest capacity ever installed by EDPR in a 12-month period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1822.86-1831.51: I think it is demonstrating how we are ramping up the business and the growth rate. In addition to that, we have 2.7 gigas which are under construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1831.97-1839.88: So I think these are numbers that speak for themselves in terms of the ramping up of the growth profile at GDPR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1840.50-1846.95: Year on year, we successfully completed one gigawatt net of asset rotation deals that's in Spain and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1847.95-1853.23: So we ended the period with a 13 giga portfolio by the end of September 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.21-1860.24: And it really balanced mix across the main platform. So North America, 55%, Europe around 40%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1860.28-1861.70: And the rest of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1861.86-1867.77: Brazil 5% and you know just still a minority position in the rest of the world here just considering Vietnam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.93-1874.79: So not yet incorporating the acquisition that Miguel referred to, essentially, in the IPAC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.76-1884.08: Our load factor achieved 28% in this nine months. It is a recovery in Iberia and Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1884.32-1890.69: Naturally, this is offset by the one-off Erkot event and across this period, a little resource in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1891.19-1900.26: Technical availability at good levels, 97%. That's slightly above this number for last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.64-1910.13: Electricity output increased 5% year on year, so this is of course benefits from the capacity of visions naturally is offset by the low resource. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1910.61-1919.38: So we generate 21.5 terawatt hours of clean energy. So we can say that we have avoided 13 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.26-1928.41: Operations in North America, Europe and Brazil generated respectively around 58% to 37% and 6% of the total input. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.25-1932.49: On page 21 in looking into the revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.07-1938.30: We have a reduction vis-a-vis last year, so it was a 5% reduction. Of course, this is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.32-1945.15: Due to sell downs. So if you were to see this on a like for like basis, we would be plus 2% versus nine months of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1946.11-1951.13: But also driven by the lower average price, about 51 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1951.55-1959.30: In some unfavorable effects, which as I said before, it's also partly upset by senior capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.82-1963.82: In Europe, the average price decreased 10% to 74 euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.22-1965.73: That's of course driven to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1965.75-1975.52: Spain, the asset mix, not only the asset mix from the 2020 asset rotation deal, but also the impact of the regulatory and financial hedges in the context of very high pool prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1976.52-1979.48: In Portugal, the tariff extension and the new additions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1980.30-1989.15: And in the rest of Europe, we actually observed an 11% increase in terms of the average revenue price or price increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.63-1992.21: That of course upsets these reductions in Spain and Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.95-2001.70: In North America, the average price increased by 1% with higher merchant prices that were offset by the aircraft event in Kewa. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2002.42-2007.95: In Brazil, average price was up by 9%, 239 real, Brazilian reals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2008.19-2013.71: And this of course back on the fact that we have, we're exposed to higher merchant prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2013.99-2017.86: And also, you know, the evolution in terms of capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2018.58-2025.11: Revenue is totaled 1.3 billion with impact from the sell down. So that's a reduction of 92 million year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2025.59-2030.95: Lower average prices. So that's minus 27 million year on year if you exclude sell down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.65-2038.96: And some forex translation, as I mentioned in the beginning, and others that account for about 54 million reduction versus last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.74-2045.51: Which of course they are not offset by the capacity additions that contribute to around 118 million year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2045.65-2052.81: So like I said before, if we were to adjust for the sell downs, we would have an increased revenues in the EDPR by 2% year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2054.03-2062.54: On the OPEX, moving to the next slide, naturally, we keep a very focused in terms of excellence of the operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2063.06-2071.11: So core OPEX per average megawatt is up only by 1% year on year. So actually, this is a minus 3% if adjusted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2071.89-2081.68: On the back of our O&M strategy. And of course, as you know, we have been floating the company in terms of resources to meet the business plan growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2083.26-2090.33: Overall, this leads us to have an EBITDA of 917 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2090.73-2095.82: Of course, this is driven not only by the top line performance, lower capital gains year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.70-2098.82: And in terms of the geographical mix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.92-2106.93: You know, pretty much a 50-50 contribution from North America and Europe to EDPR results on a consolidated basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.41-2116.14: On the net profit, we ended up the period with 148 million euros, again on the back of the top line performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2116.66-2122.88: The financials have improved. On the financials I said in the beginning, we have improved our cost of debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2122.90-2127.51: To 3.4 percent so that's a reduction 0.2 percentile points versus last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.45-2133.13: Again, I would like to emphasize that on the P&L tax as a negative impact to your own year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.51-2141.74: But the bulk of this is non-cash and cash taxes are neutral when you compare it to the nine month results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2143.58-2149.53: So on the next slide, in terms of debt, net debt and tax equity increased 191 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2150.51-2157.96: Of course, you know, the asset rotation proceeds and capital increase, they are, they have offset it or funded the growth acceleration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2158.76-2168.19: So by September, we actually have that approximately 100 million lower versus the 31st of December last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.25-2174.99: And almost 90% of the 3.3 billion net debt is at the fixed interest rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2175.52-2177.94: So as you know, it's part of our risk profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2178.62-2186.05: Tax equity increased 1.4 billion naturally following the 0.6 billion of tax equity proceeds that we announced a recently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2186.09-2193.89: But also offset by the deconsolidation of the tax equity associated with the U.S. As a rotation deal in June. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2194.91-2203.38: And just also to finalize, focusing on the period ESG on the slide 25. So starting by the environmental performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2203.84-2208.47: As I said before, we avoided 13 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2208.81-2213.75: So we are effectively contributing to this global challenge of reaching a net zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.75-2218.88: The company's emissions represent only about 0.2% of the avoided ones. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.76-2227.37: In terms of circularity, we are maintaining our recovery ratios aligned with previous years, continuously working naturally to improve on those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2227.81-2231.55: And biodiversity, no significant spills, no significant fires. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2232.37-2240.56: We have 56 near misses in the year on year. I mean, the variation is pretty much aligned with the company growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.82-2248.31: Social dimension, as Miguel said, we have surpassed 2,000 employees, so that's a 23% increase year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.99-2252.11: And actually moving towards our diversity goal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.07-2256.20: With the percentage of female employees increasing to 32%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2257.42-2258.64: Regarding health and safety. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2259.22-2263.68: There was an average of 1.7 work-related accidents per million work hours. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2263.98-2271.91: 64 lost workdays per million worked hours, which is in line year on year. Unfortunately, we have some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2271.93-2281.70: Severe accidents to severe accidents that are impacting naturally the business and we can we have been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.72-2289.05: Dedicating significant amount of time to improve the safety, health and safety across the different operations and construction sites. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2289.31-2291.53: So learning from these lessons, unfortunately. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2292.51-2299.20: And just a final note regarding communities, EDPR maintained its 5 million euros cumulative investment in access to energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2300.00-2302.66: We reached 1.1 million euros in social investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.72-2310.83: So that's slightly lower year on year, naturally given the COVID-19 response plan that we implemented last year within our local communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.53-2315.42: And with this, I would hand back to Miguel for his closing remarks. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2317.66-2325.99: Thank you, Rui. So just to finalize the presentation, just a couple of words on the overall environment and also on the outlook for renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2327.25-2336.20: First, if we move to slide 27, we continue to see an environment, a policy environment, which is highly supportive of the energy transition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2337.14-2342.60: We have the recent news from COMP 26, which I'm sure you're following now taking place in Glasgow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2343.48-2347.63: And I think it just comes to show the need to really elevate the global commitment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2347.71-2356.32: And also different measures that the various different countries and political leaders and companies are taking to fight climate change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2357.62-2361.82: So clearly this fight for climate change requires strong fundamentals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.00-2371.51: You will have an unprecedented growth in renewables, which I think it's an interesting document. I'm sure you've read, highlighted by the international energy agencies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2371.53-2376.86: World Energy Outlook, which was just recently released now in mid-October. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2377.62-2385.27: In states set to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, it would require an annual global clean energy investment of $4 trillion by 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2385.61-2388.83: So four times as much as the 1 trillion which was invested in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.27-2398.18: These are absolutely staggering values. And I mean, even a fraction of this would be a significant increase versus what we are seeing today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2398.98-2403.64: And I believe there is obviously political will by a lot of different countries to move in that direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.99-2410.39: In Europe in particular, which has been a champion of climate change, the European Commission's toolbox. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.41-2415.12: To tackle the increase in energy costs, which has been obviously a big issue on the agenda recently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2416.08-2418.68: Is very much to reinforce the need to deploy renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.48-2426.85: Clearly we need to also have energy efficiency solutions. We need to continue to build out grids across the continent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2427.87-2432.87: There will be the need to deploy 750 billion euros from the European Next Generation Fund. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2433.83-2439.88: So that's a process we expect will now be moving to the stage of application of projects at the national level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.44-2443.78: And hopefully we'll have more visibility during 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.82-2454.55: I mean, bottom line is the European Commission has been very aggressive and I think very consistent in its fight for climate change and in supporting the need for deploying renewables and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2454.57-2456.54: Electrifying the economy and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.02-2463.10: In relation to the US, I mean, clearly, I'm sure we've all been watching closely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2463.48-2466.21: The Build Back Better framework package. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2466.23-2475.50: Which has been in discussion. So as you know, there was already one package that had been approved, the infrastructure bill, which was, let's say they were tying it to the second package as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2477.38-2482.72: It's currently estimated at around $1.8 trillion that builds back better build. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.82-2492.99: It includes the long-term visibility of the fiscal incentives for clean energy investments, so the PTCs and the ITCs, potentially extending those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2494.41-2499.98: And it gives a tax credit total amount of $320 billion to support the renewables in the medium term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2500.54-2503.18: So clearly the US, it seems to be taking some good steps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2503.98-2513.87: Hopefully in the very, very short term, the next couple of days or something, hopefully no more than a couple of weeks, there will be visibility on closing that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2514.61-2520.08: As you know, it's been something which has been around for a while, but it seems that people are quite optimistic about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.44-2526.11: In terms of key takeaways, so slide 28 and then just before moving on to Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2527.05-2534.03: So first, we really are going global now. I mean, we were already a global company, but now present in 25 markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2534.05-2539.88: Which exposes the company to 75% of worldwide growth in renewables until 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2540.02-2543.92: So I think this is a very significant step that we're taking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2545.09-2550.01: This growth platform in Asia Pacific basically will leverage on Sunseep. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2550.13-2554.11: So as I was saying, established platform, fully consistent with our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.13-2561.16: It's got a low risk, long term contracted profile, which is very similar to something that we like very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2562.38-2567.55: EDP renewables ramping up the growth, 2.5 gigawatts added year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2568.13-2575.18: 2.7 gigawatts under construction, so getting closer to the three gigawatts target per year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.22-2584.48: And we now have over 8 gigawatts secured with good returns and risk profile. And so that's a 75% of the target until 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.07-2589.35: As a rotation, I've talked about very solid and good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2589.97-2598.16: Financials have been impacted in this third quarter, the nine months to date, by the lower capital gains year on year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2598.24-2600.02: Lower generation US and Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2600.18-2610.07: But we believe that the attractive asset rotation deal that we've done will allow us to close the gap over the next couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2610.31-2613.69: So I think there is a need to look through the short-term pressure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2614.07-2621.74: And really think about the underlying potential and growth of EDP renewables, which is absolutely fantastic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2622.34-2631.55: So the growth outlook continues to be very strong. We see it very strongly. EDP Renewables is extremely well positioned to capture it globally now in all the different platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2632.39-2636.12: So I'd just really like to reiterate, I mean, on behalf of the team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2636.16-2645.59: Clearly, very enthusiastic about the growth prospects for the business in the different regions and now looking forward to also tackle the growth opportunity in Asia Pacific. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2645.61-2651.05: Clearly focused on the US, Europe, Latin America, and all this additional region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2652.03-2660.46: So focused on the plan, focused on delivering the megawatts and the numbers. And now happy to turn it over to Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2660.66-2662.12: So, under. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2665.55-2669.29: Thank you. Thank you, Miguel. So we can move now to Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2669.39-2678.06: Thank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question on today's call, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2678.62-2684.08: Please ensure your line isn't muted locally and you will be advised when to ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2684.68-2689.41: If you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question, please press star 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2690.01-2695.84: So as a reminder, that was star one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2697.42-2704.00: And our first question comes in from the line of Alberto Gandolfi calling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2705.25-2708.89: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2709.27-2713.73: The first one is to go back a little bit on slide 13. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2714.31-2723.86: You basically said that you're insulated from any cost inflation. So I just wanted to confirm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2723.90-2729.01: Can you maybe again specify from on a time horizon basis? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2729.13-2735.32: Do you think you are protected on cost inflation until the beginning of 2023, Q1, Q2, end of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2735.44-2740.46: You can give us some ideas and any disruption from the supply chain you're seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2740.50-2745.11: Shipping, freight, any delays that might derive from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2746.57-2750.51: The second question is on the M&A transaction you announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2750.57-2757.88: Today. May I just ask in terms of financing, you believe that the balance sheet may. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2757.90-2764.99: Is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2765.01-2766.53: Thinking about here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2767.61-2774.75: And the last question, a bit provocative, so apologies in advance if it doesn't come out properly right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2774.85-2780.76: But you could argue that there isn't much net income that the company is generating for the first nine months of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2781.38-2784.34: So can I ask you how you explain that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2784.38-2794.47: Is it because you're really, besides the load factor that we're well below average, but you can argue that the capital gains you booked offset losses from Texas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2794.49-2801.16: Point would be is it just because you think you're ramping up capacity or putting so much upfront costs? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2801.60-2805.89: And then revenues will gradually keep growing with inflation in most jurisdictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2806.31-2810.83: Is it an increase in DEVEX because you're accelerating construction or? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2810.85-2816.48: How should we think about that and the evolution of net income in the next three, four, five years? Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2821.40-2826.41: So good questions. In relation to the first question, so the cost inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2826.85-2832.71: Yes, I mean, we are insulated, in fact, for the project that we have in the short term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2833.21-2841.86: We not only have the, in many cases, the actual turbines and the solar panels delivered and we're sort of the ones that are under construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2842.48-2846.33: We have a high degree of confidence and visibility on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2847.25-2851.35: In relation to things which are further out, and I believe you mentioned sort of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2852.25-2857.32: I mean, in those cases, what we're doing, to the extent that we haven't yet closed those projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2857.34-2862.86: We will be feeding that through into the PPAs, as I mentioned, in terms of the cost of inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2864.70-2867.47: In terms of wind turbines, we also have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2867.49-2875.64: Visibility, we have no indication to the country that we would not be able to get access to the turbines that are being contracted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2877.20-2880.44: And so that's something which, even recently, we were talking to the teams. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.92-2884.68: I think we have privileged relationship with the different suppliers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2884.86-2886.89: And so that's something, again, that's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2886.91-2896.00: We don't expect any, certainly not any material, nothing that would be sort of out of usual delays or disruptions there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2896.72-2906.17: I think in relation to solar, it is maybe a slightly different story. So in the short term, again, we have the visibility. In many cases, we already have the panels actually in our possession. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2906.33-2907.37: There's no issue there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2908.45-2916.98: In the medium term, we are obviously monitoring the supply chain carefully and talking to the suppliers almost on a daily basis to really understand if there are any issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2917.68-2918.92: So far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2918.98-2922.76: I mean, the issues that are being highlighted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.78-2927.01: Have been delays which could be, let's say,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2927.03-2937.48: A month, that's sort of the type of time frame, which is really not material in the context. So even if it's split a quarter from one to the other in terms of profitability, we don't see that as an issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2938.18-2942.10: But there is a degree of uncertainty in the market at the moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2942.54-2945.91: And so we are working very closely with the suppliers to make sure that we have that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2946.71-2952.99: We are able to close that timing so that we have better visibility on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2953.71-2961.20: But again, I'd say on wind, certainly there's no issue there. In terms of solar, just a lack of visibility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2961.26-2970.43: Which we are working through, but so far we have not had any material, let's say, indication that we would be out of, not able to comply with the targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2971.63-2974.99: M&A transaction definitely will be done on balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2975.24-2984.24: I think we have space for that. I mean, this is a transaction which brings also some operational megawatts with good profitability and also good pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2984.34-2987.95: So we would be deploying CAPEX in any case in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2988.47-2994.21: And so in that extent, we are not expecting to do anything different from what we would normally do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2994.27-3001.96: It would fit within the normal, let's say, structure of balance sheet that we would be assuming for the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3002.58-3005.43: And if you want, we can also comment a bit more detail on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3006.45-3015.14: In relation to net income, I mean, this year, obviously, there have been, you know, as I mentioned earlier, there have been some issues which have impacted us. So it's not a it's not been a great year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3015.54-3017.56: We have had much lower wind generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3018.12-3020.68: So that is certainly something which has impacted the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3020.92-3028.53: We've had some one-offs like ERCOT, which again, obviously not impacted us earlier this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3030.31-3040.30: And also in terms of some of the hedges in terms of Spain, I think we addressed that as well. Although that's, let's say, more residual. So really, the key thing has been the wind generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3041.22-3046.47: I mean, obviously we are ramping up growth. And so ramping up growth means that we ramp up DevEx, we ramp up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3046.51-3051.31: And some of the growth costs, but I think thatís what they built into theÖ. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.33-3055.60: The numbers over the medium term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.40-3065.13: So that's the guidance I could probably give you on that. But we can come back to that again if you want any more detail on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3066.67-3079.36: Very clear. Thank you. The next question comes in from the line of Manuel Palomo calling from Exxon BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3081.06-3085.01: Hello, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3085.03-3092.61: I've got a follow-up on the transaction. I understand that today's announced transaction is not just a simple acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3092.63-3102.46: Of assets, but could you please give us some additional information about the transaction in terms of operational data? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3102.50-3110.69: In terms of the expected EBITDA net profit for the year 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3111.17-3121.34: And also if you could give us a bit of the detail on those 540 megawatts in operation and under construction, how much is in operation, how much is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3121.38-3122.56: Under construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3123.10-3128.47: And my second question relates to Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3129.31-3137.24: I've seen that there's been a significant decline in the average selling price in the country from 80.3 to 58.5. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3137.72-3144.02: So I would ask for a bit of color on the granularity on the different components for this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3144.04-3148.51: Declining the price given the high wholesale prices that we are seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3148.57-3158.18: And also wanted to ask you a bit about your hedging policy for the coming years in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3158.92-3160.72: One question would be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3160.82-3169.75: If you have contracted volumes in Spain that could put you at risk in case the resource continues to be weak. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3170.01-3179.24: The other question is whether you give us an expectation in terms of volumes that are already hedged and also prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3179.30-3181.88: Which you have had some volumes. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3186.71-3190.69: Thanks, Manel. So in relation to the first question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3192.37-3202.54: I mean, some additional color I can probably provide for 2022 is that the expected EBITDA contribution would be around 50 million euros for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3203.14-3209.11: And we expect that to grow at around 25% CAGR over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3210.23-3219.54: So there would be north of 100 million, certainly by 2025. And hopefully, well, I'd say that. So in terms of, let's say, financials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3220.80-3223.26: And we don't go down to the net income level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3224.10-3227.05: In terms of megawatts, the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3227.07-3235.60: So I'd say that talking AC operating end of the year, you'd probably be expecting to have around 430 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3236.78-3243.46: The rest would be coming in early next year, so probably another 200 plus coming in in 22 AC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3244.24-3249.53: And hopefully more than that, but I'd say, let's say, on the conservative side, that would be it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3250.61-3256.16: So that's probably some of the color I can give at this stage in terms of the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3256.30-3264.42: In terms of timing of closing, it is subject to regulatory approval, so we will have to go through that still before we can actually step into the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3264.82-3267.23: So what we've done is just signed obviously the SPAs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3267.93-3269.25: And we expect that would happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3270.19-3272.71: Let's say the most optimistic scenario would still be this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3273.91-3281.08: But given COVID, the Tetra may be early next year, so in terms of actual closing of the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3282.72-3290.89: In relation to questions two and three, I can probably pass it on to Rui. Thank you. Thank you, Miguel. I'm on well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3291.35-3297.88: So regarding Spain, so maybe I think it's better if I just split this in three building blocks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3298.52-3301.14: So let's start by the actual pre-hedging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3302.10-3308.11: So we have about 2.5 terawatt hours, this generation which is under the regulated framework. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3309.03-3313.33: And in that, on average, we have a price of 76.5 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3314.53-3317.52: Then we have about one petawatt hour, so that's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3317.54-3325.77: Merchant, that capacity which is under a merchant, on a merchant basis, outside of regulatory framework. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3326.55-3333.63: And that was sold at an average price of 67 euros per megawatt hour. I mean, this includes the pool price, you know, the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3333.65-3337.04: The WAF, so the wind adjustment factor, so on and so forth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3338.90-3347.35: No, if you build these two together you get to an average price of around 74 euros per megawatt hour. Again, this is pre-hedging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3348.17-3355.82: Now, the second part of this is that, as you know, we have a hedging strategy to mitigate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3355.84-3359.60: Volatility and ensure that we have a low risk profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3360.30-3368.93: So before the year started, we had already approximately, or as the year was starting, we had approximately 2.2 terawatt hours. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3368.95-3373.65: Of energy sold forward at 53.5 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3374.39-3382.12: So basically when you combine these two, plus the fact that you have a lower wind resource this year in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3382.92-3389.83: Basically, you get down to an average price of the 58.5 euros that we were reporting and that you were referring to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3390.97-3399.08: Again, the combination is there, or this is the result of the combination of, you want to have the fact that we, once we have the hedge in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3399.10-3405.31: Then, I mean, if there is any delta towards the regulatory hedge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3405.59-3409.11: I mean, that is, will be impacting the books and impacted the books. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3409.61-3416.28: And secondly, because there is a part of this hedging that we had a shortfall in terms of volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3417.36-3425.89: And therefore, we were not able to generate the required power and basically had to buy it at the higher market prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3426.41-3435.10: So it's the combination of these two factors, what is the actual pre-hedging plus the hedging, that yields this 68.5 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3436.16-3439.16: As we move forward to 2022, you may be here to comment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3439.54-3447.43: We have approximately 70% of our capacity or generation hatched for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3448.37-3451.09: That's an average price of 50 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3451.97-3459.16: As you know, there is now a discussion in terms of regulatory, some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3459.18-3462.64: Potential regulatory change impacting the 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3463.88-3468.51: Which the government is discussing this with different renewables associations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3469.83-3479.78: So this is something that we have to wait and see what is the outcome of that discussion and to what extent it could potentially impact the hedging strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3479.80-3481.08: Towards 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3481.24-3490.07: I mean, if nothing changes, as I said, I mean, we have about 70% that's around 2.2 terawatt hours also ahead for 22 full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3499.32-3504.24: The next question comes in from the line of Jenny Ping, Corncrombe City. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3505.49-3506.67: Hi, thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3507.11-3508.57: I have two questions, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3508.75-3513.21: Just going back to the point around supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3513.23-3524.08: We've just heard on the offset call about solar panel delays in the US and best as obviously reported today and they highlighted some of the delays around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3524.10-3528.11: Onshore wind, two out of three orders are being pushed back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3528.93-3536.04: I understand you say that you've got very strong relationships, but I just wondered whether you can elaborate a little bit more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3536.06-3539.78: Around that do you have existing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3539.80-3550.23: Sort of contracts in place to effectively mitigate any or claw back any loss earnings on the back of any delays in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.25-3556.74: Some of these supply chain issues which may come through end of this year, next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3557.52-3567.19: Just really trying to understand where your strong relationships, how that manifests itself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3567.75-3569.01: And then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3569.05-3575.48: Secondly, on Sunseep, Manuel has already asked quite a bit of the details. I just wondered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3575.52-3579.26: Whether you can give the debt number, the net debt number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3579.28-3580.54: That you'll be taking on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3580.58-3584.92: And then very lastly, an apology for a newbie question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3585.33-3588.11: But when I look at Equinor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3588.13-3597.64: When I look at Allstead, all of these companies are now starting to report, at least give guidance around their ETH.EXE gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3598.10-3602.76: I just wanted to hear what your latest thoughts on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3602.78-3608.21: In terms of your views and including the gains in EBITDA. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3610.89-3615.80: Thank you. So taking the first question on the supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3616.28-3624.10: I mean, first of all, we have contracts obviously for everything that is under construction and that we have secured. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3624.68-3633.99: And so to that extent, those contracts typically have clauses which in the case of delays or significant delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3634.49-3640.74: There are penalties associated with that, and I don't think it's in anyone's interest that there would be those delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3641.40-3647.09: We have these long-term relationships. I mean, we've been in this business now for almost two decades. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3647.67-3653.59: We're not the number one customer of Vestas. We are probably close, depending maybe on the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3654.47-3660.00: So I think in relation to that, obviously we work with them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3660.46-3666.43: Try to have the best terms possible, but we also have the contract in place and we will obviously enforce those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3667.01-3671.39: And as I mentioned earlier, we have had no indication that there would be any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3671.41-3679.32: Delays on the project that we already have on the construction or that we are developing over the next year or so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3680.30-3681.68: In relation to solar panels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3682.36-3686.01: I mean, there it's not so much a question of, let's say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3686.19-3694.79: Well, I'm sorry, in relation to pricing as well. I mean, obviously that's already built into the contract. So when we lock in the CAPEX, we're also locking in the pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3694.91-3696.60: And yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3696.82-3698.84: And so to the extent that it's closed, it's closed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3699.20-3703.86: If, for example, we are still in the process of an RFP or a tender or something. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3704.38-3710.95: And there is an increase in the CAPEX estimate, then we will feed that through into the higher PPA prices or the auction prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3711.45-3715.92: And so that's why I gave the example of Spain, where you saw an increase in the tender prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3716.34-3720.18: And also in some of the PPAs that we are currently negotiating where we've gone back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3720.20-3727.87: To the customers with higher PPA prices. And since it's a general sector-wide thing, that's being accepted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3729.59-3731.81: So I'd say that that's the visibility that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3732.03-3734.37: In relation to solar, as I say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3734.51-3740.58: Again, we have good long-term relationships with suppliers like Longy, Bouvier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3740.94-3745.63: Which are some of the top suppliers globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3747.85-3753.89: To the extent that there is issues on pricing and there have been, we are also feeding that through into increased PPAs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3754.47-3758.68: In any case, when we talk about increases in PPAs, we're talking about maybe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3758.70-3766.13: 2 dollars, 2 euros per megawatt hour. I mean, that's the sort of size of the delta that we see in some cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3767.03-3775.34: In terms of actual timing, as I say, there, there's some uncertainty. So we have had no indication that there will be any material delays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3775.94-3784.68: But in any case, it is something that we're following closely. So obviously, we know that there have been issues in the supply chain further upstream. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3784.92-3792.47: And so, I mean, we're continuing to monitor the situation, but I don't have any specific, let's say, guidance to give you on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3794.19-3802.00: Apart from that, it seems to be manageable within the current context or within the current, let's say, estimates that we had given out to the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3803.76-3808.49: In terms of net, sorry, so hopefully that answers the question or it's giving you a little bit more color on the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3812.11-3815.34: In terms of the net debt for Sunseek, so it's around $200 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3815.68-3822.36: So I think we've given enterprise value $870 million, equity value around $600 something million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3822.86-3825.93: And so I think that's the, you know, the delta would be around 200 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3826.51-3831.27: What we have said, however, is that some of these projects are under construction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3832.41-3840.72: Over the next couple of months, sort of by the end of the year, probably the enterprise value would be closer to a billion because of the additional CapEx that will be in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3841.00-3848.81: So let's say breaking it down into very specific numbers, EV870 as of the date of signing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3848.83-3854.05: Equity value 690, net debt 180. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3854.31-3861.04: And as I say, the enterprise value will be closer to a billion by the end of the year, which is probably when we would do the closing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3862.70-3864.32: In terms of guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3865.57-3866.77: I mean, to be honest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3866.79-3875.74: We have been considering now for a while that the active rotation strategy is something which is an intrinsic part of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3875.76-3876.88: I mean,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3876.90-3882.42: We build mega-watts, some of them are to keep, others are to sell, and we give visibility on those gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3883.44-3885.37: And so when you talk about x gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3885.69-3887.97: I mean, what we've indicated to the markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3888.05-3897.50: Let's say in the context of our business plan, is that the capital gains implicit in the business plan are roughly 300 million per year over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3898.22-3903.22: So if you look at the numbers that you have for EDPR, that's sort of the level of gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3903.84-3912.01: And so one minus the other would give you, let's say, the guidance X gains. Thank you, Ram. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3916.90-3923.04: The next question comes in from the line of Mikhail Zubala, Queen from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3924.72-3926.87: Hi, good afternoon again, we are on the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3927.65-3934.77: Questions from me please. So as you pointed out in your slides, the last draft of the US reconciliation bill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3935.24-3937.86: Proposing 10-year extension for subsidies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3938.84-3945.53: Would you prefer to say that there is upside to your long-term capacity targets from February? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3946.43-3954.87: And could you give us an idea in terms of the incremental opportunity here versus your plan if those extensions become a reality? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3956.00-3964.24: And the second question is, we've seen permitting issues in most of the European markets. It's been a problem for new projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3965.71-3973.11: Could you please discuss the visibility that you have right now over SunShip's pipeline, given its... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3973.45-3976.70: So big vis-a-vis the operational capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3977.50-3982.20: What can you tell us about the permitting situation in some of those Asian markets? Is it better? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3982.74-3990.09: Than in Europe and also conscious that it's a bit of a different game for distributed solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3991.01-3999.22: So is it fair to say that this is easier – technology easier to permit than utility-scale solar? Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4003.28-4012.99: Yeah, so I mean, great questions in relation to the first one. I mean, I think actually your first question is slightly related to your second question as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4014.25-4021.02: So the 10-year extension is absolutely fantastic. I mean, obviously, it gives a big boost to the industry as a whole in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4021.04-4025.43: Know, just continues. I mean, if renewables is already competitive, even without. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4025.53-4033.07: The PTCs. I think this really gives an extra boost to continue the growth of renewables in the US, both wind and solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4033.27-4039.98: And also even other technologies like storage and hydrogen, which will also, and offshore, which also get, let's say, that additional boost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4040.92-4047.61: I mean, I wouldn't want to necessarily give a specific target because I don't have one of upsides to the long term goals that we've given. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4048.17-4058.06: What I would say is I would go back to one of the comments which I made, which is if we want to reach the targets, the overall sort of Paris Agreement targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4058.10-4059.32: The one and a half degrees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4060.14-4066.61: We would be investing $4 trillion per year globally, as opposed to the $1 trillion. So quadrupling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4067.53-4074.07: I mean, obviously, that's not the basis for our numbers. So our numbers are based on, let's say, more conservative growth plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4075.46-4081.10: But I mean, this is just a massive amount. So I don't think the issue, I mean, the sky's the limit in terms of number of megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4081.22-4087.11: I think the big issue, which is on the table in terms of how fast we can roll this out,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4087.13-4097.72: Is making sure that each individual country has very specific targets so they go from that more aspirational goals to very concrete goals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4097.74-4100.34: Yearly goals over the next 10 years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4100.90-4106.25: And they translate that, for example, into tenders or they translate that into a sort of specific processes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4106.27-4111.35: So that they continue to drive the demand at the national and at the regional level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4112.43-4121.06: And then I think one of the things which we've also been highlighting both with the European Commission and also within associations like Wind Europe or Euroelectric,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4121.28-4122.80: Is around the permitting issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4123.90-4125.95: But obviously some countries are easier than others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4127.97-4130.03: I think there is work that can be done there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4130.29-4138.36: And that's something that I know at the highest level in the European Commission and I think also in the European Commission. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4138.82-4144.46: They are looking at preventing issues, how they can look at the best practices of different countries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4145.11-4154.43: Come up with a list, for example, of countries and how they rank in terms of time to be able to get the permits done and to get projects sort of approved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4155.28-4157.52: As you know, can vary quite a lot between different countries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4158.02-4166.53: And so I think focusing now on some of those issues and making sure those are more facilitated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4166.75-4176.02: I think that will help certainly translate some of these more ambitious targets into very concrete numbers on the ground and accelerate even more what we're currently seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4177.30-4184.26: In relation to sunscape in particular, I mean, I think in Asia Pacific, definitely the issues around permitting are relevant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4184.72-4189.13: Because it is a densely populated region of the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4189.71-4194.65: Which is good and bad. I mean, it's good because there's a lot of demand there. There's a lot of need to decarbonize the economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4195.32-4203.82: But it does mean that land is expensive and you need to really manage, let's say, those permitting to make sure it's compatible with the local communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4204.52-4212.35: I think that's why things like floating solar or reclaiming land or offshore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4212.57-4219.38: I mean, all those are distributed generation, which is actually something which is really growing a lot in a lot of these countries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4219.82-4223.02: Are ways of reaching those objectives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4223.62-4230.55: In a way which is consistent also with the permitting issues and with the impact on the local communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4231.43-4238.96: So I think Sunseek has been very successful in terms of what they've done over the last couple of years and the way they have positioned themselves for this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4240.02-4241.56: In terms of growth going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4241.70-4242.88: I mean, we're talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4243.04-4252.91: Probably being able to grow at 200 to 300 megawatts at least in the short term per year AC instead of 300 to 400 DC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4253.99-4256.82: And I think, as I say, I'm probably upsiding that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4258.22-4262.32: Given the different markets and just given the overall size of the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4263.42-4265.41: Hopefully that's added a little bit of color to the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4271.95-4277.82: The next question comes in from the line of Philip Oropasian calling from Odo. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4280.00-4286.31: Just three follow-up questions. The first one is concerning the 540 megawatts of sunsee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4286.55-4293.25: You mentioned at 1 million euro per megawatt which seems to be quite high. Could you just elaborate about this figure? That's my first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4293.63-4303.68: You mentioned also 20-year PPA, which is good news regarding the duration, but is the 670 MW which are in operation and securized. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4303.70-4308.85: Are fully under PPA, means 100% of the capacity is under PPA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4309.23-4312.91: That's the second question. And the last question is concerning the valuation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4313.25-4320.58: Could you just elaborate how you valued the value creation you mentioned on slide 11? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4320.60-4326.31: Means that you could just give us some parameters you use or more simply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4326.37-4328.53: I would say this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4328.55-4339.14: On the bracket margin generated versus the construction cost which seems to be quite high, somewhere around 50%. Could you just elaborate concerning this valuation? Many thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4342.80-4349.25: In relation to the first question, so the 540 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4349.59-4353.77: I mean, it's high, but you have to think about it in terms of distributed generations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4353.81-4364.32: So we're talking about smaller project sizes, typically would be in the single digit megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4365.05-4372.21: And obviously in locations which have higher cost in terms of deployment because they are more distributed generation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4372.23-4381.42: In terms of the CAPEX, given the way they were developed, I think it's normal or what would be expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4381.90-4391.21: Also, just to remind you, it is AC and not DC. And sometimes I think when people are comparing the CAPEX numbers for solar, it is important to make that distinction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4391.25-4396.82: Because obviously it is, you know, AC and DC do have around a 20% difference. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4399.12-4408.93: So I think in relation to CAPEX, I mean, obviously, we think CAPEX will then continue to come down over the next couple of years. But let's say that would be one first comment in relation to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4409.93-4412.65: In relation to the second question, the 20-year PPAs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4413.31-4420.36: So yes, it is pretty much fully contracted for the PPAs or regulators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4420.56-4424.64: I think that's mentioned here on one of the slides. I don't have... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4424.74-4426.89: You can find exactly the number of the slide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4426.99-4429.65: But that is fully contracted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4429.75-4433.21: And at around 75 euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4433.27-4440.96: I just also highlight the, let's say, the price of the, or the implied price of those PPAs slash regulated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4441.90-4446.65: In relation to the value creation, I'm glad you asked the question. I mean, what I would say is, you know, we look. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4447.15-4454.07: When we look at these projects or we look at these acquisitions for a platform, I mean, we are applying the same type of investment metrics that we do for other projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4454.57-4459.42: So in this case, we would be looking at, let's say, above 2% spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4459.44-4461.18: Over our cost of capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4461.76-4469.91: And that's assuming, let's say, a relatively prudent growth plan over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4470.61-4478.98: So let's say it would be basically taking the current operational projects and let's say in the margin on that using that sort of spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4479.70-4484.92: And then also looking at the future value creation that will be had with that growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4486.01-4494.79: And overall, it has to be in line with our investment criteria, so around the 1.4 times or at least above the 2% spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4495.44-4498.24: So that's sort of the way we would look at it from an evaluation perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4498.54-4500.26: That's why in terms of the slide, if you notice. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4501.08-4506.19: And the way we brought it out, it's the CAPEX and then the value creation and the pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4506.85-4516.40: And those three bars actually sum up to more, or at least visually they should sum up to more, look more than the implied enterprise value actually paid for it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4516.78-4524.56: Because we do believe we are getting a good return for this investment, assuming reasonable assumptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4526.09-4540.04: Just one additional, this means that for the pipeline of the 4.8 GW, you have taken the assumption that the utility scale business are going to be bigger than the DG. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4540.26-4549.49: And means that your CAPEX will go down toward the normal level of what we are seeing in some projects around the world, somewhere between 0.5 and 0.6. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4549.55-4550.93: That's correct to assume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4552.41-4559.88: What we've looked at, and probably the best way to think about it is we've looked at what would be a reasonable growth rate, or relatively being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4560.00-4569.11: Relatively conservative, obviously we don't want to be too aggressive here in terms of growth of megawatts over the next couple of years, 2025 thereabouts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4569.71-4579.24: And the implied value creation that we will be getting on that, assuming our typical investment return. So around the 1.4 times WAC or above 2% spread. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4580.00-4582.68: And so just saying that implied in that pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4583.38-4591.95: We're assuming that we will develop at least part of it, not all of it, but at least part of it over the next couple of years, that we will be creating value from that pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4592.49-4600.68: And that will give us a return which will be, let's say, quite a bit higher than the 870 that we are paying for the platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4603.98-4605.49: Any thanks? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4607.95-4614.17: The next question comes in from the line of Jorg Alonso calling from Sochia General. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4616.08-4620.52: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions left, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4621.74-4625.41: Regarding the expansion into new markets, specifically in Asia,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4626.13-4628.17: This is a solar platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4628.71-4632.45: Do you think it could be a good idea for you to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4632.47-4640.00: To look for a similar transaction or similar approach for developing wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4640.32-4646.43: In Asia or do you think your capabilities are good enough to go and do it directly? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4646.99-4649.57: And the second one is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4650.05-4657.32: If you can provide a little bit of color about a work in progress that you do you expect to have at the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4657.34-4662.74: Which amount of money would be invested and reflected in the net debt but not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4663.56-4666.23: Contributing to AVIDA. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4668.69-4671.77: Thanks, George. So in relation to the first comment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4672.89-4680.44: I think I mentioned in the presentation that we would look to leverage on this platform to bring our competencies in wins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4681.60-4689.15: So we are not looking, we are not thinking about buying any additional platform in Asia for wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4689.29-4696.58: We think that, you know, given the team and the quality of the people there, plus our own expertise and the people we have internally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4696.70-4704.66: That we would be able to build on this platform to develop the wind component to it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4704.74-4708.87: It's not in our plans to go out and do another acquisition for a specific wind platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4711.53-4718.44: In relation to the second question on work in progress, I'm not sure we have the specific number. Perhaps we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4718.68-4722.84: You know, we can follow that up later, but it's not something I have here off the top of my head. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4735.20-4740.68: This is Cumberland from the line of Sara Pagini calling from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4743.28-4746.41: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4748.01-4753.99: Just a clarification if possible about the deal of SunCity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4754.59-4763.78: So how do you consider the distributed solar generation versus the utility scale generation? Do you think it is a more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4763.80-4769.25: Risky business or they have similar characteristics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4770.15-4773.89: And when you indicate the 75 Euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4774.98-4784.16: I presume this is for the assets already secured, but do you expect this tariff to be applicable also for the future projects? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4785.51-4795.02: And then also about the pipeline, I understood that a large part of the pipeline is also related to floating PV. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4795.74-4800.10: Can you please indicate a level of capex per megawatt for this technology? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4801.28-4803.56: And then the second question is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4803.58-4819.78: About the guidance. Could you please indicate what is the level of EBITDA and net debt that you expect by year-end considering the 300 million capital gains and also the acquisition of Sunseed? Many thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4826.47-4834.43: Sorry, in relation to your questions. In relation to the first one, distributed generation versus utility scale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4835.56-4844.70: I mean, I think one of the key things, and we've also been doing a lot of work on Asia Pacific and seeing how we can take advantage of the growth opportunity there,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4845.05-4846.39: It is quite densely populated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4846.63-4856.38: And I think that's something to bear in mind. So distributed generation there, which can be sort of two megawatt, that type of range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4856.72-4860.10: 1 to 10 megawatt type range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4860.42-4870.25: Can be quite an interesting solution because it can be deployed much closer to the industrial customers or the customers that, let's say, that we are entering into PPAs with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4870.91-4876.18: And then growing that at scale in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4877.02-4880.22: So it is relatively similar, I'd say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4880.36-4889.71: In the sense that you have also specific counterparts. And I mentioned some of them, whether it's an Amazon or Microsoft. Those are the type of customers that you can also have in this case. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4890.93-4894.39: That's true for some markets. In other markets, for example, in Vietnam,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4894.53-4904.20: I mean, maybe you have a regulated tariff, and so in that case it would also be, for the utility scale, it would also be something that we would be considering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4906.27-4909.21: So from a technological point of view, it's not so different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4910.31-4912.21: From a regulatory point of view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4912.45-4921.12: I mean, the key thing is also looking at the regulation or at the counterparty. So I don't think they're very substantially very different businesses at the end of the day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4921.50-4929.85: And we're not talking B2C. When I talk distributed generation, we're talking basically CNI and B2B customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4931.01-4934.13: So I don't see it as a materially very different business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4935.64-4942.22: In terms of the second question, the 75 euros per megawatt hour, so these are for assets already secured. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4942.74-4947.47: I mean, obviously, this will evolve over time, depending on the countries, depending on whether. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4947.51-4955.24: What are the CAPEX assumptions that we'll be using or getting for the different projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4957.84-4961.58: I would say that over time, we would expect these numbers to probably start coming down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4961.68-4968.81: As also the economies of scale start kicking in in some of these geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4969.35-4972.43: But I would say that it still is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4972.69-4982.14: They would still stay relatively high numbers, certainly compared to perhaps some of the numbers we see in other parts of the world, for example, like in Iberia or some parts of the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4984.74-4991.97: So the 75 euros per megawatt hour is for what we have secured. I wouldn't expect it to deviate too much over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4993.19-5001.48: In terms of floating PV solar CAPEX, I don't have a specific estimate for that. We can get back to you on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5002.06-5007.37: When we are looking at what is the value of a certain pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5009.13-5018.86: The most important thing for us is do we think that we can get a positive value creation, positive margin on the projects when we invest in them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5018.96-5024.80: And that's why the metrics that we look for, whether it's the 2% minimum spread or the 1.4 times WAC,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5025.45-5027.19: That's really what's most relevant for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5027.77-5034.19: That needs to be technologically feasible. We need to make sure we have a good counterpart and that the PPA is competitive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5035.34-5039.36: In terms of the specific CAPEX estimates, maybe we can come back to you with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5041.22-5047.09: In terms of EBITDA net income, what I'd say is that we are still comfortable with consensus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5048.53-5053.97: And essentially, it will depend very much on, as I mentioned in the presentation,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5053.99-5059.00: On closing some of the asset rotation transactions before the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5059.66-5066.43: So I think we're making good progress there. As you know, we have several transactions on track that we signed earlier this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5067.07-5076.96: And so I'd say we will be above the $300 million. That is our expectation by the end of the year. And so in line with the EBITDA and net income. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5076.98-5078.08: That's out in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5085.35-5086.99: In which I think has been given out by IR. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5092.33-5098.54: Thank you. The next question comes in from the line of Oli Jeffery pulling from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5101.28-5103.82: Hi, two questions for me please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5104.82-5113.03: First is on going back to the poor wind resource that we've seen this year and just asking the question again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5113.79-5120.44: Do you have any reason to believe that the P50 load factors that you're assuming in the future for wind should be lower? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5121.88-5130.77: For example, are you having any, are there any noises internally getting louder about having to look at this again? Or are you aware of any studies that are questioning? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5130.79-5133.73: P50 life hackers as we look at them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5134.07-5140.04: And also are you looking into this, are you carrying out an assessment into this area to see if you're still comfortable with where the P50s are? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5140.90-5146.11: And then the second question I have is just specifically on the Portugal and Poland. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5146.13-5152.35: Cells, you know, done at quite high EV, megawatt multiples, 2.4 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5153.41-5160.20: Can we expect when you complete these, that the gains that you get on these assets on a per megawatt basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5160.40-5168.53: Are significantly higher than the 250 per megawatt we saw at the beginning of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5168.81-5174.15: You might expect that the gains here are going to be really quite chunky and in excess of 500,000 a megawatt perhaps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5174.51-5177.84: Any comments on that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5181.26-5187.97: Hi, so I think in relation to the first question, that's the question I certainly ask internally constantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5188.57-5191.91: And so far, there's no reason to believe that this is changing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5192.15-5193.37: I mean, that's the honest answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5194.11-5200.36: When we look back over 20, 30, 40 years and look at the long-term trend,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5201.12-5205.37: And sort of we factor in the last couple of years or in the last couple of quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5206.01-5208.79: I mean, there's volatility. There always has been volatility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5209.77-5216.14: It seems to be within the normal range and so the overall trend line does not seem to be deviating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5217.90-5224.14: There will be good years, there will be bad years. I mean, this is clearly not a good year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5224.26-5234.35: The only voice I think that is Hui and myself making sure internally that we are sufficiently comfortable to be able to tell you and the rest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5234.41-5238.02: That we have no reason to believe that this is changing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5238.20-5244.97: And so thatís the question we ask ourselves internally and thatís the assessments weíve been looking at and sort of the statistics weíve been looking at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5245.55-5248.97: And as I say, nothing has led us to believe that there is a change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5250.31-5252.21: In relation to the second question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5253.77-5254.91: I mean, yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5254.93-5256.00: You are right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5256.04-5266.07: I would say particularly in the case of Portugal, it would be a higher multiple per megawatt. In Poland, it'd probably be more in line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5266.13-5268.25: With the values that you indicated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5269.11-5272.71: I mean, we will provide specific numbers on that, obviously, when we close them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5273.51-5282.46: It is all subject to adjustments and to changes depending on the contractual provisions that we have with the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5282.48-5290.33: The buyers and so that's why we typically only give out the final numbers when we actually close the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5290.39-5295.52: Hopefully, by year end, we will have done that, and then we'll be able to provide additional information on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5295.88-5302.10: But I would say yes, I mean, your intuition is right in that the gains per megawatt will be higher than the two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5306.25-5317.66: Thank you. The final question comes in from the line of George Gamara, calling from JB Capital. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5319.50-5322.36: I just have two follow-up questions if I might. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5323.40-5329.57: The first is a technical one related to your issues with the regulatory edging in spine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5329.67-5334.11: I would like to understand exactly the mechanics of what happened in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5334.29-5341.10: And if possible, if you can quantify what was the impact in the quarter of this regulatory edge, as you might call it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5341.76-5351.49: And the second one is related to distributed generation. You are doing a massive push on distributed generation with this acquisition of SunTip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5352.67-5355.80: Could we see, and this is a theme that you mentioned in the past. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5356.40-5363.96: Could we see EDPR buying more platforms of distributed generation in other geographies? Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5367.21-5375.46: So in relation to the first one, I then pass it to Rui and probably in more detail we can also then take it offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5375.48-5381.28: Just to walk you through the exact mechanics, but I'll pass it to you. Perhaps I'll just answer the second question first. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5381.86-5383.64: And then I pass the ball. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5384.90-5385.91: In relation to DG. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5387.77-5393.69: I think the G, well first, we're talking about typically these platforms are more B2B or CNI. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5394.21-5401.10: And so the line between DG and utility scale sometimes becomes more blurred, certainly in certain geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5401.78-5408.43: So I think our position has been that the same way that we look at wind, solar, offshore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5409.17-5412.79: Within these technologies, you then have slightly different segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5412.87-5414.41: And sometimes these are blurred. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5414.85-5417.38: So you can have, for example, utility scale in France. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5417.84-5427.35: Which can be maybe 10 megawatts, and you can have what we would call distributed generation, which might be also some single digits or close to 10 megawatts, depending just because it's behind the meter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5429.09-5435.62: So I think we do see synergies there and we do see these as different ways of attacking the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5435.64-5439.84: In different geographies and also depending on the particular regulatory environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5442.40-5449.57: I wouldn't see ourselves buying a lot more platforms, or at least we don't have a strategy for going out and buying more DG platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5450.19-5453.85: We have done that selectively where we think it adds value to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5454.29-5457.26: So this is one case. I mean, SunTip does both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5457.78-5466.35: Does it's expected going forward to do about 50% each 50% utility 50% more to see and I DG. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5467.35-5474.07: We have done that in the US with C2, so that's also a complement to our existing platform in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5474.67-5481.36: And I think that also gives us a good insight into the dynamics of the DG market in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5482.14-5491.85: So again, we will do it selectively. We do think it's a good way, particularly in some geographies, of getting access to more growth, particularly on the solar side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5492.71-5499.14: But it's not something that we have an active strategy of specifically going out to buy more of those platforms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5500.96-5505.51: In relation to the first question, then I'll pass the ball to you if you want to take that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5506.63-5511.61: So I will definitely we can take it offline and go through in more detail, but just in a ballpark. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5511.99-5521.54: So we have about 15 million euros impact, 10 to 15 million euros impact in Q3 from this financial hedging in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5522.42-5530.65: Our full year estimate is around $25 million on the basis of a P50 wind resource in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5531.63-5535.76: So that's the amount or the range that we are talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5536.54-5540.02: I mean, the mechanics just, you know, in one minute is basically once. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5540.08-5546.69: If you're if you have regulatory so wind farms in the regulatory framework and if we are hedged. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5548.09-5556.20: As you know, if the price goes above the regulatory cap, you will have to get that additional revenue back to the system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5556.52-5562.22: But if you are hedged, because we decided to hedge some volumes within the caller so that we don't take that volatility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5562.58-5568.15: Then you need to give back the delta to your hedging and not to the regulatory gap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5568.65-5578.26: So that's what it's impacting. But again, if you want, what I can do is we take it offline and go step by step so that you can get comfort on the numbers and the dynamics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5589.33-5595.42: Be there. Thank you. That was the final question in the queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 5601.34-5607.53: Okay, thank you very much everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks everyone. Take care. 
asr:0: END
