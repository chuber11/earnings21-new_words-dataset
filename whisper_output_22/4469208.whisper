asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.96-1230.31: Some of the major infrastructure projects, such as the third line of the Panama Metro, are now starting and will start to improve market dynamics in the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1231.25-1242.74: Haiti, on the other side, exhibited significant price improvements, but cement dispatches have been low due to a political and social stability in the country, in addition to some technical difficulties in the plant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1242.76-1246.03: Derived from the earthquake that occurred on August 14. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1247.13-1256.00: Puerto Rico also had a positive price performance followed by 7.4% year over year decreasing in volumes explained by a higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1256.02-1261.10: Comparison based for last year, resulting from the pent-up demand experienced after shutdowns.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1278.92-1286.75: A marvel of modernity located in the middle of the French Guyana, close to the town of Kourou that has its inaugural flight on September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.91-1299.06: For this project that makes part of the European Space Agency, we dispatched around 54,000 tons of three different types of cement with high levels of performance and advanced technical specifications. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1299.16-1308.83: One product that was introduced to the space complex portfolio was a road binder, a soil and road stabilization solution with a broad application possibilities in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.75-1317.62: Across the region, average prices increased 6.1% year over year, reaching the highest average quarterly price of the last two years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1318.08-1327.15: This positive evolution caused by the combination of recovering local markets and the increase in import parity prices are strong signals of the economic recovery in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1329.35-1335.46: Costs were also impacted in the CCA region due to the inflationary pressures affecting the global economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.86-1343.24: Especially prices of the fossil fuels that are commonly used in most of these countries to generate electricity for both the residential and industrial sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1343.70-1349.65: And sea fried costs that had a significant increase during the third quarter and impacted some spot cargo.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1359.16-1369.27: The incremental cost in fuels, freight, and raw materials, as well as the maintenance of the Carpagena plant that affected the volume of experts in favor of the volumes of trading during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.99-1379.32: Year-to-date EBITDA accounted for $117 million with an increase of 32.4% year-over-year, explained by the strong performance of most countries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1379.72-1385.41: We expect inflationary pressures to continue in the short term in the CCA region given the macroeconomic conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1385.49-1391.77: But market dynamics with positive pricing trends should lead to positive results in the following quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1394.43-1398.36: Thank you Camilo. I would like now to make reference to our balance statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1399.24-1403.32: September 2021 our net debt to EBITDA plus dividends.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1504.80-1514.41: Thank you, Juan. We will proceed now with the Q&A session. Please remember that in order to ask a question, you need to raise your hand using the icon that is at the bottom of your screen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.93-1517.80: I will say your name and company and we enable you microphone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.52-1526.43: Take into account that you need to unmute your microphone before you speak. First question comes from Juliana Aguilar from Banco Lomé. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1530.57-1532.75: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.25-1541.74: I have three questions. My first one is regarding your energy matrix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1542.22-1546.93: I was wondering if you could tell us how is the energy matrix currently composed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1547.27-1555.80: And how do you expect it to be in 2030 in accordance with your goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 29%? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1556.56-1565.53: My second question is, given the cost pressures you're experiencing, do you expect consolidated EBITDA margin? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.55-1568.81: Remain below 20% in the coming quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.21-1573.73: And last one, just to be sure, the $62 million EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1573.75-1581.04: Figure for the US in this quarter is not excluding the non recurring expense of the 4.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.06-1582.32: $6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1583.60-1588.53: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1588.55-1593.73: Good morning Juliana and thank you for your questions. I mean our energy matrix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1593.75-1600.42: It's basically composed of coal, natural gas and pet coke. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.88-1608.55: We are using alternative fuels at more or less a consolidated level of 5 to 6% right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1609.13-1615.88: Our goal to comply with our target of CO2 emissions to 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1616.24-1624.00: Is to increase that use of alternative fuels to at least 30% in our energy matrix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1624.34-1626.87: And that together with the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1626.89-1630.81: Increasing the use of alternative cementation materials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.83-1639.76: Will allow us to reach that goal of 523 CO2 tons per equivalent ton option that we have targeted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1639.78-1641.48: For 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1645.89-1650.81: The second question in terms of cost pressure. Yes, I think that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1650.83-1660.80: Impact of the cost fuel inflation in the quarter was more or less 1% of our revenues impacting our EBITDA margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1661.24-1667.77: Our goal going forward is still to have margins in excess of 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.87-1671.23: We see a very favorable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1671.25-1679.34: Pricing environment going forward that will allow us to mitigate the cost inflation that we are facing currently. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.72-1683.06: So in all of our projections. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.08-1691.97: Our margins will still be in excess of 20% on a consolidated basis going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1697.00-1700.60: And can you please, Juliana, remind me of the third question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1701.76-1716.20: Yeah, I just want to be sure that this, that the EBITDA figure for this part today, $62 million, is not excluding the non-recurring expense of $4.6 million you mentioned from the cleanup process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1732.55-1744.10: Rodrigo Sánchez from the Vivienda Corredores. Yes, good morning and thank you for the presentation. I've got two questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1744.52-1750.01: The first one is, could you please comment on your commodity prices hedging strategy going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1750.75-1756.10: And as of today, how much of the expected consumption is under any type of FG? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.24-1760.06: And my second question is related to CAPEX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1760.20-1768.79: And how much are you expecting to invest in the US to upgrade or update your port infrastructure to be able to? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1768.81-1771.89: To use its full potential. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1775.08-1776.22: Thank you, Rodrigo Amir. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1776.54-1777.84: Currently we are not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.00-1787.39: Using hedge on our fuels. I mean, what we have is some contracts in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1787.63-1797.32: And that way, I mean, we are mitigating in some way the increase in fuel prices that are currently going on in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1797.56-1800.10: But we are not using hedging strategies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1801.84-1808.69: In terms of CAPEX for 2021, we're still working the numbers for the 2021 budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.03-1812.85: So we are still not given any guidance on the CAPEX for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1815.74-1823.96: Thank you for your question. Next question comes from Nikos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1824.00-1825.83: Paula Slipman from Morgan Stanley. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1832.77-1838.36: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1838.78-1844.50: On pricing if you could provide any any color on the pricing dynamics in the United States during this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.99-1850.11: It looks, when we look across the different reports from different companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1850.15-1856.46: Have been very different dynamics depending on the markets. We'd be very interested to hear what you've been seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1856.86-1864.82: And also, if you can provide any color on what kind of pricing increases you're looking at for early 2022. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1866.19-1872.37: Thank you very much, Nicolas, for the question. I would like Bill Wagner to answer that question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.06-1877.98: Nicolas, thank you very much for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1878.42-1888.15: What we're seeing in the US is some pretty strong headwind, as you know, with inflation. Our goal, like we've said in the past, is to stay above inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1888.87-1892.37: And that's why we did announce a second increase this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1893.15-1898.12: You know, we're monitoring that closely also going into next year and our goal will be similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1898.46-1903.40: There's still a lot of headwind, although I think some inflationary costs may lighten a little. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1904.24-1912.11: Our goal is to stay ahead of inflation, so we'll do that through the revenue side of the business and the pricing side of the business, but we do expect to stay ahead of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1916.88-1926.05: Other competitors have talked about double digits anywhere from $12 to $15 in January. Is that sort of the ballpark number that you're thinking about? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1927.43-1937.80: Yeah, Nicholas, I don't really comment on specific pricing like that. So, you know, like I said, I mean, our goal is to stay ahead of inflation and we expect that, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1937.82-1945.91: Pretty strong demand next year and I think we've done a pretty good job this year on the pricing side so our expectation is to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.93-1951.37: Stay in that same ballpark, let's just stay ahead of cost. Got it. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1967.01-1970.71: Good morning. Thank you very much for the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1971.73-1978.12: My first question is regarding infrastructure plans in Colombia, the U.S., and Panama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1978.74-1985.85: I would like to know how much dispatches you are expecting from this segment in the three regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.87-1989.81: Compared to what we have been seeing in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1991.45-1994.17: The second question is regarding metal prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1994.29-2001.94: I am wondering if you are seeing high metal prices as a risk for the demand in the residential sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2003.74-2009.85: And my third question is regarding port capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2010.15-2013.57: I saw on local media that you are planning to expand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2013.59-2021.72: The Cartagena plan farther to 2 million tons expert capacity. So I would like to have more color in that plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2025.05-2032.75: Thank you, Estefania. I mean, we are expecting solid growth in infrastructure in all of our regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2034.19-2038.96: The demand in Colombia has been really strong. I mean, we're expecting the market to close too. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2038.98-2046.85: To 13 million tons of demand in 2021 and we see further growth in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.23-2054.93: So we expect the infrastructure segment of the market to continue performing well in Colombia into 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2056.22-2064.46: In the US, similarly, we are expecting solid growth in our volumes in the US going into 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2065.61-2072.75: We expect the impact of the infrastructure package to start materializing more into 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.41-2082.80: But in any case, we are expecting the segment to continue growing at least in the mid single digits in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2083.58-2088.95: In Panama so far things are starting to improve a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.47-2098.58: And we are confident that the major infrastructure projects that are in the pipeline in Panama will start to materialize in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2099.56-2104.02: Being that segment one of the main drivers of demand in Panama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.44-2113.77: We expect volumes to grow at least high single digits in Panama next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2118.46-2125.41: In terms of adding capacity to Cartagena, we have been doing that for quite a long time already. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.47-2130.73: We are planning to grow export out of Cartagena. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2130.75-2137.70: Between 35 and 40% next year, I mean going from 1 million tons to close to 1.4 million tons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2139.16-2147.43: We are finalizing the expansion of the Cartagena port. So that will help in a significant way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2147.49-2152.81: So that is basically the expansions that we are planning in Cartagena to take advantage of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2152.83-2160.98: Major opportunities that we are seeing not only in Houston and all the markets in the US but also in Central America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2161.00-2162.10: And the Caribbean. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.10-2169.43: In terms of cost inflations impacting the residential sector in Colombia and in other markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.45-2175.18: Up to now we still see a very good dynamic in terms of housing starts and sales but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2179.28-2181.00: Of the major challenges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2182.56-2189.77: Going into 2022 and things will be a little bit of that cost inflation. But so far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.69-2194.29: The dynamic is still very positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2207.25-2210.87: Next question comes from Vanessa Kiruga from Credit Suisse. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2214.87-2217.68: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2218.20-2226.47: The first one is a quick one about the cleanup process in the US. Just wondering if this will continue in coming quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2226.49-2230.93: In terms of the inventory and assets evaluation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2231.43-2237.04: The other one is about Central America region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2237.48-2246.83: Can you remind us what each of the main countries there is contributing to revenues and maybe that is possible? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.87-2251.41: And wondering specific about your outlook for IT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.27-2260.30: And finally, just reviewing your strategy to mitigate that cost inflation, energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.32-2262.56: Cost inflation in each region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2262.72-2264.84: On beyond pricing strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2264.94-2266.01: I mean, what are you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.07-2272.55: Doing in terms of contracts or flexibility of the use of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2272.83-2276.78: Fuels and increasing in alternative fuels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.54-2283.94: Cure Alizami. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.64-2292.11: In our processes that we have been carrying out for the last... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2292.73-2301.92: To finish that process, probably see an impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.04-2310.59: Similarly to the one that we recorded in third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.89-2317.76: In term circuits in the CCA situation in Haiti, I would like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2325.69-2329.71: Excuse me, you're breaking and I don't think I can hear you well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2333.81-2338.50: I'll take for the answer in lieu of Juan on CCA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2339.36-2346.83: So the situation in Haiti, as you might have read on the news, Vanessa, is complicated in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2346.85-2352.93: Political and the situation overall in the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2353.85-2360.88: We expect it to, of course, improve. I think that Haiti has had this in the last years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2361.76-2366.15: Recurring of course not in the same way that is happening in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2366.17-2373.59: This year, but we expect the country to fully recover and have a good performance over the last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2373.61-2377.40: Quarter or at least the last few months of the year and then next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2378.48-2385.75: So there's a good demand for cement in Haiti, growing population, and there's a lot of opportunity in Haiti. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2385.79-2390.35: So we still think that it's a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.37-2393.97: A potentially good country with a lot of growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.52-2404.44: He also asked about individual countries. I don't know if we have them specifically in the numbers, but for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.66-2409.29: It's around 10 million EBITDA for Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.05-2419.52: $3 million for Panama, six for Dominican Republic, and three for Puerto Rico. That's probably the largest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.00-2421.78: Of a bit down in the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.41-2429.03: That's great. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2429.95-2436.76: I don't know if Juan is back to discuss about energy strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.86-2442.64: Hear me now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2444.20-2453.87: About the issue, so I would like Amina, Carlos, Camilo, and Bill just to talk about the mitigating strategies that we are putting in place for cost inflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.66-2459.22: Okay, one. Hi, Vanessa. I'm glad to hear you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2460.70-2462.22: In related to Columbia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2462.80-2468.07: We are first way where we are trying to increase the use of alternative fuels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2468.59-2473.27: Mainly in Rio Claro and in our plan of Cartagena. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2473.91-2480.28: As well, we are trying to mix different types of codes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2480.86-2488.81: Which is possible in Colombia because we have different sources for this for this for this growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2489.53-2498.12: In the case of the Cartagena, we usually use the call from the Cucuta region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2498.30-2500.78: But we are missing with other sources as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2501.76-2507.51: But the first objective is to increase the alternative fuels in the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.06-2519.42: The next. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2519.48-2527.37: On the US side, I think a couple of things that we've been doing that we're mainly focusing on now is because of the increase in natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2527.39-2536.88: We've begun, I guess a month or so ago, shifting some of our plants back to using coal, which has reduced our cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2537.04-2538.12: To some degree. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2538.60-2543.82: And I think along with Carlos's point, alternative fuels has become. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2543.84-2550.53: A focus of ours and has been for some time and we continue to move into a more positive direction with alternative fuel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.05-2557.02: And Vanessa, for the Caribbean region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2557.18-2566.31: We also have the project now in place or starting in the short term for increasing alternative fuels in Honduras. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2566.95-2573.71: That will of course give us a little bit better pricing or a very better cost in just fuels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2574.15-2577.58: But we have implemented already various. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2577.64-2584.00: Alternatives there in Honduras with respect to trying to get the best possible fuel cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.06-2589.89: And that's using high sulfur fuel in combination with fluoride, which is a mineralizer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2590.23-2596.62: Which allows us to use hydro for fuel, petcoke, which is lower cost than normal petcoke and coal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2597.20-2603.74: And the other thing that we did is we increased our capacity of storage in our Rio Blanquito facility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.86-2608.45: That also gives us the possibility to bring in much higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2608.47-2612.83: Volumes of Fedco can decrease the cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2613.27-2620.48: Also, you know, we've implemented photovoltaic energy for Honduras and we're planning to expand that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2621.04-2626.09: And other than that, we are negotiating contracts that will include. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2626.11-2633.01: More for electricity in other countries, such as the Dominican Republic, that will include more PV as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2633.07-2639.58: So in the mix, we'll try to ease up on the inflation costs, both for fuel and electricity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2641.98-2646.85: Thank you, Kami. Finally, Vanes, I would like to repeat my answer to your first question because the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2647.29-2655.62: Connection was unstable so I was mentioning that we are in the final stage of the cleanup process in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2656.98-2661.22: We expect to finalize that process by the end of the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2662.12-2669.55: It has been an ongoing process for the last 18 months. I mean, just doing physical counts of fixed assets because of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2669.57-2679.12: All the activity of acquisitions and then divestments in the US, we wanted to do like a physical count of all our fixed assets in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2679.42-2686.95: So probably you will see like a similar ride off in the fourth quarter, but that will be the end of that process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2689.65-2692.39: Thank you very much, everybody, for the clear answers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2697.78-2700.00: The next question comes from Francisco. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2705.77-2715.18: Good morning and thank you for the call Juan. The question that I have is, now that you are expanding your overall port capacity in Cartagena,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.84-2723.96: Is there any constraint from your maritime terminals in the US to match the overall import capacity that you have in the United States? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2724.38-2733.25: And second, a question related also with your overall set of grinding meals that you have in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.27-2738.66: That clearly are prepared to blend lots of types of different cements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2738.68-2740.00: Across the region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2740.52-2747.39: Is there any regional challenge in terms of permissions of approved blended cement products? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2747.41-2753.89: In Florida relative to say South Carolina or North Carolina. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2754.11-2759.20: Is there any meaningful differences on the type of the blended cement products that you make? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2759.22-2762.08: That you may allow to sell in those markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2762.18-2774.77: And how do you see the overall reception on the market of switching more to blended cements compared to the Portland cement product? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2775.22-2777.98: And lastly... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2778.36-2785.79: One of your levers that you described to mitigate or to cut emissions on your. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2785.81-2791.73: 2030 goals relates with the increase in the share of alternative fuels, but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2792.09-2795.82: What about the overall intensity in energy? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2796.16-2798.36: Is that a lever that should be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2798.38-2803.64: And we should be seeing to potentially cut emissions as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2803.68-2808.61: And if that might imply additional capex in your plans and perhaps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2808.63-2812.69: More, more, more Catholics in certain regions compared to others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2815.10-2822.62: Good morning, Pacwan. Thank you for the questions. In terms of any constraint in the US,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2823.60-2830.83: We currently have like an import capacity of close to 4.5 million tons in our ports and terminals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2831.39-2838.24: What we will do and what we are doing to match the increased capacity out of Cartagena is to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2838.26-2842.02: Increase the capacity of imports in our Houston port. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2842.98-2847.03: We will be able by the end of 2022 to probably. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2847.05-2853.21: Double the input capacity that we currently have at that terminal in Houston. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2853.63-2858.06: So that is an important piece of our strategy going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2858.64-2866.49: And we will continue investing in our ports and terminals in the US because we see that those assets are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2866.51-2872.93: Very important strategic advantage that we have in the company going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2875.38-2885.17: In terms of blended cement in the US, we are extremely excited with the potential of 1L cement in the US. I would like BL2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2885.19-2889.63: Give you more color on our strategy with one is going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2891.31-2899.80: Francisco, thank you very much for the question. As of now, you brought up the challenge of acceptance, and I think there's been. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2899.86-2905.13: A lot of movement towards accepting blended cements in the U.S. Most of the states now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2905.15-2910.33: Have moved towards full acceptance. There are a few, none of which are in our current footprint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2910.91-2920.68: That are still questioning it to some bit. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there. And we're moving our strategy very quickly to that effort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.32-2928.85: As of right now, we feel like next year somewhere between maybe upwards of just over 30%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2929.25-2937.54: We could end up blending, which I think would be a big benefit to the company and our results. And again, it stays in line with our overall strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2938.24-2940.82: So yeah, we're pretty excited about the opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2943.34-2947.79: Is happening in terms of the levers and to reduce our CO2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2947.81-2950.89: Impact emissions and ensure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2950.93-2958.70: I mean, it is not only to increase the use of alternative fuels to reduce the clinker to cement ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2959.64-2964.62: With not only the growth of 1L cement in the U.S., but also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2964.68-2970.73: The increasing importance of alternative cementitious materials such as calcined clay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2971.71-2980.94: Which has been a real success for us in Colombia. We see a huge potential for that type of green cement in all of our geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2981.30-2991.99: And of course, I mean, improving the energy efficiency of our processes is another important lever in that goal to reach the target in 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2993.95-3000.66: Thank you for that. It's very clear. If I may, just an additional question in overall pricing dynamics in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3001.10-3010.57: Now, clearly, costs are on the rise for FOB clinker costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3011.27-3020.20: I guess that now your overall import, the overall capacity for you to match. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3020.22-3026.63: The import parity costs that you see in the region have increased by the increasing tariffs as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3027.15-3039.64: Is it fair to assume that the prices in Colombia are likely to increase, including the coastal, the northern zone of Colombia in the coast? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3041.00-3050.09: I mean, we are bullish on the prices in Colombia going forward. I mean, import parity prices are increasing in a significant way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3050.83-3057.50: FOB prices are still way lower than the, in our opinion, is the equilibrium level for the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3058.34-3062.76: So we are very optimistic about prices in Colombia going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3064.12-3072.67: Thank you so much. Take care. Juan, we don't have any more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3075.16-3083.98: Okay, so once again thank you very much for your interest in cementosargos and looking forward to our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3084.00-3088.33: Final conference call next year for the closing of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3090.13-3092.93: So see you soon and to everybody have a great day. 
asr:0: END
