asr:0: OUTPUT 84.80-93.83: Starting with the market context, very briefly, as you all know, we continue to live under some restrictions and direct impacts from the pandemic during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 94.51-98.40: But already with very encouraging improvements over the last few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 99.46-104.08: The vaccination rates in both Portugal and Spain are quite high. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 104.54-111.83: And therefore, the public health context remained largely under control, which enabled a gradual return to normality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 113.11-121.60: Before we dive into the operational performance, I would like to give you an overview of our most recent portfolio management activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 123.04-129.61: So this was a particularly active quarter for Sonae as we announced a major deal in the beginning of August.

asr:0: OUTPUT 132.11-138.50: In which we sold 24.99% stake of SunIMC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 138.52-142.80: For initial upfront value of 528 million Euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 143.60-149.15: We also acquired GOSH, a UK plant-based food manufacturer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 149.17-155.28: Which allows SONAI to invest in a high potential sector while expanding our international footprint.

asr:0: OUTPUT 185.37-197.12: With a strong delivery from the food format and also a robust recovery of the non-food format after a long period of restrictions which impacted these banners quite significantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 197.72-203.96: Total turnover grew 5.3% year on year and 2.3% like for like in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 203.98-209.85: The exact same evolution as in the first half of the year on the back of a very good trading performance of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 211.65-219.42: In food retail, we continue to gain market share and increase our leadership gap, having posted positive life-alike growth across all formats. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 220.40-228.13: The online business also continued to grow, having reached a 40% year-on-year increase in the first nine months of the year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 246.77-256.88: On the back of productivity gains and the permanent fine-tuning of its core business processes in spite of some pressures that were felt in terms of energy costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.54-264.08: In the first nine months of 2021, the Lange VPA improved 6.1% year-on-year overall.

asr:0: OUTPUT 287.93-289.53: In terms of free cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 289.67-293.81: The company reached €169 million in the first five months of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 293.95-303.48: An additional 42 million when compared to last year, also driven by the conclusion of the sale of the 50% stake in MaxMath, which represented a cash-in of 68 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 304.40-312.55: This cash flow generation led to a reduction in net debt of just over 100 million euros to 453 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 312.57-318.46: Even after the dividend payments of 140 million euros in the second quarter of this year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 351.43-362.28: In terms of total sales, Vorton reached 285 million euros in Q3, a slight decrease year on year of 3%, which is basically explained by the repositioning of the operation in Spain mainland. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 362.98-371.07: On a pro forma basis, so excluding this movement, consulted turnover increased 8% year on year in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 372.01-378.84: In year-to-date terms, total turnover increased 3.6% year-on-year, a 12% like-for-like increase.

asr:0: OUTPUT 385.55-388.99: The online channel continued to perform extremely well, I would say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 389.73-397.58: And at the end of the first nine months, growth was already above 30% versus 2020, which was already an extraordinary year for our e-commerce operation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 398.18-402.78: So overall online sales grew by a factor of three since 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 404.16-411.21: Regarding profitability, Align EBITDA reached 20 million euros in Q3 and 51 million euros up to September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 411.39-421.16: A level of profitability which is a factor of both our top-line positive performance and also the repositioning process that we executed in this bank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 423.04-424.54: Regarding for my fashion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 424.70-434.17: Q3 was marked by a sales performance that was increasingly positive throughout the quarter as COVID-19 related restrictions were gradually lifted. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 435.06-440.60: Still, total turnover reached 95 million euros in the quarter, a 6% year-on-year decrease. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 440.62-446.67: Which reflects a weaker than expected recovery of footfall in sales performance after the reopening of stores in Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 447.43-452.23: In year-to-date terms and despite all the restrictions to store operations in the beginning of the year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 452.79-461.84: So my fashion's total turnover stood at 230 million euros, almost in line with 2020, which is a positive sign in our view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 462.50-468.95: In terms of profitability, I would like to highlight that Sonic Fashion was able to post an underlying ETA of 8 million euros in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.97-473.77: Which means that the year-on-year evolution in year-to-day terms is still quite positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 475.88-484.78: As for Iberian Sports Retail Group, the latest quarter showed another very positive set of results, both versus last year but also versus 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 486.77-490.39: Total growth versus 2019 actually reached 32%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 491.71-499.10: With the online channel remaining an important growth avenue for the company. So total e-commerce sales increased by a factor of four since 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 499.76-503.94: And this is still before the consolidation of Depar Village, the acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 503.96-510.17: That was made at the end of June, beginning of July, which will only impact revenues in the coming quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 511.05-522.82: So, overall, the last nine months registered top line levels above both last year and 2019 figures. As I said before, with total turnover reaching 590 million euros, a double-digit increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 522.84-530.35: Of 26% year on year, and of 18% versus the nine months in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 531.11-535.16: Regarding Ebitda, once again, the top-line improvement was able to drive profitability upwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 535.20-542.34: And in the last nine months, EBITDA improved by 51 million euros year on year and 20 million euros versus the same period of 20. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 543.46-548.49: So this resulted in an MBTA margin improvement to 11.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 549.55-557.92: All in all, the contribution of ISRG to Sona's results in Q3 reached 6.7 million euros, above both 2020 and 2019 figures.

asr:0: OUTPUT 564.28-573.35: With ISRG showing growth and profitability enhancements in line with the ones that we saw in previous months across all channels and geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 576.64-583.72: Going forward and looking at SunEye Sierra, SunEye Sierra's operational activity showed steady progress during Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 584.46-591.41: Following the improvement of the pandemic context and also the relief of restrictions in our main European geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 592.17-601.98: In this context, occupancy rates remain high and tenant sales were already very close to 2019 levels in the European portfolio at the end of the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 602.00-605.04: And in some assets even above 2019 levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 605.87-613.03: The services business line delivered a positive evolution in the quarter, showing significant signs of returning to a more normalized activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 613.33-622.90: And if we look on a proportional accounting basis, direct result in Q3 stood at 12 million euros in the quarter, already practically in line with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.94-624.04: 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 624.20-629.77: And 23 million euros in the first nine months of the year, which compares with 5 million euros last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 630.99-636.36: Indirect result in the quarter was practically flat as we typically do not revalue assets in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.68-643.94: And all in all, net income reached 6 million euros in the first nine months of the year, which represents a year-on-year increase of 26 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 644.97-652.59: NEV increased marginally to 913 million euros and LTV remained at quite conservative levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 654.89-660.14: At Sonai Financial Services, the performance was overall positive in operational terms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 660.78-668.81: The main leading indicators showed sustained improvements after the relief in restrictions and also the gradual increase in consumer confidence.

asr:0: OUTPUT 717.98-727.43: In terms of profitability, results are still subdued given the transition stage which we are living in, going into the new business model with Blanco CTT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 729.71-735.12: Special note to MDS which has been posting very positive results with significant increases both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.14-740.86: In top line and operating profitability when compared to 2020 and also to 2019.

asr:0: OUTPUT 745.67-759.18: Turnover for the first nine months of the year stood at 49 million euros, slightly below last year, and then the line of ETA was practically nil, given the transition stage I mentioned before at some ISS with Banco CDT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 761.64-767.73: Moving on to Sona AM, Q3 was another quarter with important developments in the portfolio management front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.75-774.87: With the conclusion of the sale of BizDirect and CB4 during the quarter, which resulted in capital gains of around 10 million euros.

asr:0: OUTPUT 906.05-917.62: With Nosh acquiring the largest fraction of the spectrum's release and in all possible bands, which positions the business very well to lead the 5G revolution in Portugal.

asr:0: OUTPUT 958.64-965.27: And also the sales of BuildDirect, CB4, and Arctic Wolf, which happened in Q2 at Zon.io. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.17-976.90: All in all, EBITDA reached 531 million euros, standing significantly above last year, driven by the better underlying operational profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 976.94-983.10: But also obviously by the significant level of capital gains and the recovery of equity methods consolidating businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 983.90-990.05: As a consequence, direct results reached €169 million as of September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.01-996.60: Versus 40 million years last year, while indirect income also improved versus 2020.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1016.00-1025.63: And if we add to this the free cash flow generated in our portfolio management activity, so nice free cash flow before dividends paid stood at 555. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1025.65-1035.44: Million Euros in the last 12 months, which after the dividend payments which occurred last May led to a significant decrease in our consolidated net debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1035.46-1039.70: To 858 million years at the end of September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1040.00-1042.64: And to an all-time low LTV of 9%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1043.64-1052.61: This solid capital structure is obviously complemented with a comfortable financing position with a low cost of debt of 1.1%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.63-1055.80: And an average maturity profile of 3.4 years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.96-1061.64: So this is it from me for now. I will now open the session to Q&A. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1063.98-1071.23: Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. As a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press star on your telephone keypad now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1071.93-1075.18: When preparing to ask your question, please ensure your device is unmuted locally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1079.12-1084.22: Our first question comes from Joao Pinto from JB Capital. Joao, your line is now open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.93-1091.39: Hello everyone, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on capital allocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.69-1100.96: What do you intend to do with your own shares? Will you keep them to use as liquidity to invest in the future or would you consider a cancellation? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1101.84-1108.81: Secondly, also on capital allocation, following the SunIMC deal, I imagine you're looking for alternatives to invest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.67-1119.30: We know you are not in a rush, but can you tell us if you are already seeing good candidates to acquire, including the sectors, or nothing in the pipeline at the moment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1120.68-1129.67: Third, on SunAMC, Like4Like keeps solid despite the test counts. Can you tell us if it remained positive in October? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.15-1139.68: And also on IMC, can you give us some color on OPEX pressures and the competitive environment? And how do you see margin evolving next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1143.68-1151.35: Thank you, Joanne, for your questions. I will take the first one, then I'll ask Rui to comment on the SONAMC one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.55-1156.26: So in terms of capital allocation and starting with the own shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1157.22-1163.08: The TRS cancellation was basically a financing decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.52-1176.04: So, as you know, the equity SOP that we had with Banco BPI was a financing arrangement and obviously with the significant cash proceeds that we received in recent months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.14-1181.20: We had to optimize our credit facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.22-1184.92: And this is one of the operations that we decided to terminate given. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1184.94-1187.85: The analysis that we made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1189.31-1194.77: So these shares, in all honesty, these shares were already in accounting terms, they were already considered as own shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1195.84-1202.06: And they were also in practice our shares as we were exposed economically to the variation of the shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1202.68-1205.23: So in that regard, nothing really changes for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1205.27-1212.91: So basically we terminated a financing arrangement and those shares remain as our own shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.07-1220.88: So we do not have any changes in the outlook and in the possible usage of these shares going into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.64-1226.45: And so again, the straight answer to your question is no, we do not plan to cancel these shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1228.37-1237.50: Regarding the cash proceeds from the CVC transaction and the alternative possible uses,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1237.52-1238.86: For those cash proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1240.00-1248.99: You're right, I think we have discussed this in the past. We do not have, or we didn't have at the time of the transaction, any specific use for those cash proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1250.03-1253.27: That was not the main rationale to do the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1253.89-1262.54: And we will remain, as I said before, very disciplined in looking at alternative investments opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1263.02-1267.21: And we will look at opportunities that make sense for us with a long-term perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1268.65-1275.80: Obviously we do have identified opportunities in our current portfolio to invest and we will continue to invest in our current portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1276.44-1279.22: And we are also looking at opportunities outside of the current portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1279.50-1283.82: We just announced recently the investment in gosh, which is a sector which we like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1284.00-1290.03: The food and high-tech sector is the sector which we believe has a lot to do with Sanai, has a lot to do with who we are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1290.39-1297.92: We will continue to look for opportunities in that segment, but also in other segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1297.94-1301.40: Somehow relate to us and where we feel that we have a right to play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.48-1304.84: But whenever we have something to announce, we will obviously do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.83-1307.27: Do you want to take the time to see questions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1308.55-1317.88: Sure. Hi, how are you? Thank you for your question. Beginning by October, the performance in October was very positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1318.68-1324.58: Pretty much similar to the evolution that we presented in the electrolytes in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.79-1334.41: Was OK and we feel very confident that the rest of the year will continue to present a very solid set of results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.34-1340.76: Going to the other question related to the market environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.30-1346.57: Well, we'll continue for sure, as aggressive as it is tonight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1348.21-1357.50: But we feel very confident to maintain the benchmark levels of profitability that we are presenting and we will continue to present in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.90-1363.90: Feel very confident due to the efficiency programs that we are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1363.92-1370.55: We are developing internally, which came to us with a very good result. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1373.01-1379.40: Just to follow up on that one, are you seeing inflation in negotiations with suppliers and energy costs? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1380.00-1383.76: Logistics, anything relevant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1385.29-1394.21: Well, up to now, what is happening is that in fact the energy costs and transportation costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1394.25-1397.44: Are increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1397.46-1400.66: But not yet having a dramatic effect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.68-1405.77: Dramatic cost, dramatic point of view in terms of cost structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.59-1412.79: But if the costs continue to evolve the way that we are seeing and we are witnessing in the last months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.85-1422.26: For sure, all retailers will need to consider those cost evolutions in the prices that they. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.32-1428.53: They are offering to the customers, obviously. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.21-1443.10: Our next question comes from Jose Rito from Acacia Bank. Jose, your line is now open. Yes, hi. Good afternoon to all. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1444.02-1450.41: So a question on IMC and post the clarification on the lag for lag moment when matching just this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1451.13-1457.28: Just a quick question on the online sales performance that has been quite strong this year despite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1457.30-1464.10: The fact that last year was also a strong period for the online channel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1464.58-1471.05: If you can share some data on this channel economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1471.07-1474.87: Namely, if it is already margin positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1475.04-1484.60: And if it is not, what is needed for this part of the business to start to have a positive contribution to the PTA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.97-1487.73: So that will be my first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1488.25-1490.09: Then on the fourth turn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1491.21-1493.49: We saw this strong like-for-like in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1493.63-1502.48: The question is if this was driven by Portugal or Spain or only Portugal and what categories has been driving growth? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1504.92-1512.15: Also, on Vorton, in terms of marketplace strategy, if you can share any insights. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.69-1520.80: Namely the percentage of GMV, any mid-term targets, if this is margin-equitive or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.48-1528.57: And finally, I think that João mentioned that the online channel has also been performing very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1528.59-1533.31: Question if you are seeing lower cells densities in stores? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.33-1535.18: In Portugal. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.00-1548.79: Let's do this in order. I'm listening to a bit of noise, so not sure if everyone can mute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1551.99-1559.72: Okay, better now. So let's take this in order. Let's start with Julian and some MC questions and then follow we'll take the Varsity one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1562.44-1570.15: I suppose you are OK according to your voice. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1571.15-1575.64: And the question is very striking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1577.48-1583.66: As. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1584.02-1589.11: We see the business as an omnichannel approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.67-1596.66: The customers of the online are basically the same customers we have in the offline business. And when we look to the online business,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1596.78-1601.40: We look to the customers we have in the online platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.90-1609.35: Meaning we look to the EBITDA of those customers and they are offering us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1609.37-1612.37: Very high levels of AVTDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1613.11-1617.74: Meaning they are very profitable, meaning that the online is also very profitable to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1619.46-1621.58: Yes, the online business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1621.60-1630.37: As it is, well, if we only consider the acquisition and the purchasing that the allocators do in the online. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.85-1636.30: We are fighting to get well, we are almost fighting to break even in terms of victory games. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1636.40-1646.07: But those customers, the same customers go to the other stores and in fact they combine the levels of the IBTDA that they offer us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1646.21-1650.89: Are much higher than the average that we get from the regular customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1651.17-1654.59: So we see that this operation has been very profitable, in fact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1659.26-1660.78: Know if I answered your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.50-1668.89: Very good. I think so. So should we move on to the Vartan and Pulsey-Moy? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1671.35-1677.72: Okay, good afternoon to you all. Thank you, Jovier, for your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.02-1682.98: Also, regarding the like-for-like and the geography performance... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.10-1690.15: We saw positive life-like performance in all our geographies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1691.25-1692.35: I mean... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.51-1700.02: Strongest in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1700.36-1708.69: We focus the operation in online and in one stop, but mainly online and we have been investing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1708.71-1712.41: To guarantee that you continue to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.91-1719.64: So in a lot of like places we were able to grow significantly in Spain, especially on the online channel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.96-1726.47: But all the other things were positive in terms of like flight, so performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1728.83-1736.04: Moving on to the marketplace, regarding the GME percentage, it's still small, but it's growing very fast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.90-1739.94: And we have high ambitions for this business model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.94-1744.94: We believe it's going to be one of our main growth avenues in the long run. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1746.33-1757.70: So we are preparing the company to expand in terms of new categories and repositioning the brand so that we are able to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.72-1765.27: To expand our business to these new categories and enlarge the marketplace contribution to our profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.19-1767.57: If it is profitable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1767.85-1771.31: Yes, we do. As you know, the marketplace... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.33-1780.00: This model is quite simple, I would say. We charge a commission to our sellers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.48-1781.60: We don't have stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1781.76-1790.13: We leverage the online infrastructure, so it's certainly attractive to the ability of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1793.01-1798.28: Moving on to our store performance, given the good performance of the online channel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1799.36-1801.64: In fact, in the third quarter,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1802.64-1809.69: Our offline market share group, our stores are performing very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1810.87-1813.85: We see positive likes and dislikes in our stores. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1815.76-1820.48: Gain in market share, so very healthy operation offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.72-1828.15: Notwithstanding the fact that we see the consumer electronics market slightly contracting in Liberia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1828.99-1832.85: At work, our stock performance has been positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1833.67-1838.02: So everything is going, for now, very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.93-1850.65: Our next question comes from Arta Amaro from Keisha Bank. Arta, your line is now open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1853.41-1855.48: Good afternoon everyone. I have two questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.68-1864.16: I would like to know if it's possible to disclose the market share of SONIMC and Vorton since you've been repeatedly gaining market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.19-1868.85: And if possible number two and number three in terms of players. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.67-1877.44: And I also understood that this partnership with the CTT has changed the business model of Sonai. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1877.46-1882.76: Financial services so when can we expect positive EBTDA for this division. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.18-1884.72: And thank you for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1887.09-1892.39: Very good. Thank you, Artur. I'll take the last one on the partnership with CTD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1892.47-1894.39: And then I will ask. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1894.41-1902.74: Who you and Paolo to comment whatever they can disclose on the competitive positions in both some IMC and important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.52-1910.69: So regarding the partnership with CTT, as you know, as we've discussed before, it's a change in business model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1910.99-1913.69: And so previously with a partnership with BNP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1913.95-1922.32: We had a commission which we charged up front for the generation of credit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1922.46-1928.57: Loans and so and now we are basically building a credit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1928.59-1933.39: We are building credit along the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.55-1939.22: And so this means that we will take a while until we reach run rate in terms of the credit production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.86-1944.46: And so we have this initial valley in terms of credit production, which translates into lower results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.07-1946.93: Going into your question directly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1947.07-1948.19: Yeah, this is temporary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1948.25-1957.54: And we expect to reach positive levels of EBITDA in the next few quarters and reach the same level of profitability at least that we had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1957.58-1967.09: Historically, in the next 12 to 18 months, depending obviously on the evolution of the business and obviously also the restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1967.11-1970.91: That are still in place and that also affects our financial services activity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1972.67-1980.50: Very clear from the usual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1983.86-1992.17: Okay, sure. Hi, this is Steve. Starting by the questions regarding the market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.73-1996.44: Is a very difficult issue to approach because. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.96-2005.73: There are several institutions, well there is no institution giving us the proper figures for market share in Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2005.81-2014.39: What we generally use, some internal research regarding the monetary evolution and also information from Nielsen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.14-2024.36: Nielsen generally gives us the market share variation and in fact we are growing in terms of market share to 30 basis points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2024.38-2034.23: Comparing to 2020 and roughly almost 1% point comparing to 2019 which is amazing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2035.24-2044.40: Well, for instance, the other big players in Portugal, PINGOSOS is growing 20 basis points in terms of market share according to Milsim. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2045.05-2049.95: But it was losing two percent of points against 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.21-2059.68: Well, then we have other players losing market share like for instance Intermarche this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2061.50-2071.09: The mini-price is losing market share, Woshan losing market share and Lidl growing market share, it's growing roughly 40 basis points in terms of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2072.19-2076.66: And reaching approximately 10% or 0.2% in terms of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2077.24-2085.41: Ourselves 9 to 10 percent of our point in terms of market share. We believe that we have approximately 24 percent of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2086.85-2096.34: And we continue to grow market share. We feel very confident to assume that we, according to last figures, we knock to the floor, continue to gain some market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2097.92-2105.85: So just a little follow up, Rui. So the gap between you and player number two, in this case, Pindos, has been widening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2106.77-2109.93: Exactly, exactly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2111.01-2114.15: Well, yes, because it's very similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2114.55-2121.48: If we compute for instance the sales they announced to the market and the sales that we used,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2121.68-2126.51: Basically sales from our hypers and super divisions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.23-2131.65: With the difference between those two players are increasing every year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2132.37-2140.00: And we are gaining market share. In this year, we will continue to gain some market share comparing to the figure that we were having last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.32-2142.60: Very clear. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.45-2153.49: Regardless of the sources, we have been widening the leadership gap versus the second player in the market in the last two years quite significantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2154.01-2155.70: Do you want to take the Vorton question? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2156.96-2166.55: Sure, thank you for the question, Artur. So, regarding the market share, we also use some references based on market research. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2168.19-2173.27: Mainly a panel of retailers that are interested in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2173.29-2181.94: That work with GFK in our case, that cover, and this panel of retailers covers the large majority of the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2183.82-2193.43: Now the Sun doesn't cover all the markets so we have to do some estimates and some extrapolations to reach our estimates and it's our own estimate of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.51-2201.26: It's not as we were mentioning, it's also the case in Vorton, we don't have any official number of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2203.04-2205.29: So regarding working in Portugal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2206.51-2211.61: We have around 30% market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2212.99-2217.26: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2218.52-2220.40: In the Kennedy Islands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2222.06-2229.17: We are co-leaders with the media market and we have a very small operation in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2231.19-2239.82: Regarding the overall market share in Portugal, which is what impacts more our results, we have gained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.60-2247.35: Around 1.8% market share in the third quarter, and year-to-date 1.3%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2251.61-2260.34: Can you give us an idea of how much is the percentage market share of player number 2 in Portugal? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2261.24-2262.32: We don't have any information. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2263.18-2266.91: Okay. Very well. Thank you very much, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2267.15-2269.33: I think it's also fair to say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2269.35-2278.66: That our online market share is very close to our offline market share. And in some quarters, it has even surpassed our offline market share in recent times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.88-2285.75: It again in the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2293.09-2299.40: Our next question comes from Antonio Saladas from AS Independent Research. Antonio, the line is now open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2301.16-2305.33: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations for the figures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2305.99-2308.69: I have two questions. First one is related with SOP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.71-2317.46: If you have any information that you can provide us regarding this legal process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2317.48-2321.76: I need to finish or what are your thoughts about it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2322.18-2329.49: The second question is related with your financial structure that you mentioned, that is quite solid, probably solider than ever. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2330.89-2332.77: Should we consider next... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2332.91-2341.02: It makes sense to consider an externality dividend by March, April next year if you don't buy anything until. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2341.04-2347.09: Until the first quarter or not. Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2349.41-2358.18: Thank you, Antonio. So on Zopt, the answer is a quite straightforward one. It's no. We don't have any developments on the judicial front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2360.00-2363.88: So unfortunately, the situation remains the same. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2364.36-2367.19: Again, as we've said before,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2367.31-2368.95: Hmm, I have no clue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2368.97-2379.84: The company has not been affected by this by any means, and so the company, as you can see by the results, is still operating, continues to operate normally and executing its strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2380.10-2390.11: And the 5G auction was a very important milestone in terms of strategy execution and something that we wanted to ensure, to ensure that the company would come out of the auction as a leader. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.13-2392.61: In terms of the spectrum acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2393.37-2395.32: And so that's the most important thing for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.66-2404.44: Obviously, we would like the judicial situation to evolve and to enable us to execute what we have announced to the market already over a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.88-2410.93: But unfortunately, up until now, we do not have any more developments to communicate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2411.73-2417.42: Regarding the financial structure and the possibility of an extraordinary dividend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2418.20-2423.12: But this is obviously, as you know, we are still far away from the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2424.14-2430.75: It's not so nice practice to distribute external dividends as long as we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2430.77-2435.24: Interesting investment opportunities to allocate our capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2436.56-2442.22: And I would use that as your base case scenario going forward. We have a very steady and stable dividend policy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2442.56-2445.59: We believe that it is a very attractive one with a very interesting dividend yield.
