asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 1.68-8.19: Thank you for sending A and welcome to ADP's First Class 2020 Result Presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 8.89-15.76: At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 16.32-20.58: If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 21.38-26.67: If you should require any assistance during this call, please press star zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 27.43-31.29: As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 31.37-38.52: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Miguel Viana, Head of Investor Relations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 39.28-45.27: Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 45.71-53.93: Being with us today in the conference call on EDP's first top 2020 results which this time the results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 55.88-58.24: And some role in the experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 58.86-67.77: Take some rest and recharge batteries. We'll begin with the main highlights on the results and then we'll provide an update on the strategy execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 68.25-76.96: We'll then move to the Q&A session in which we'll be taking your questions both by phone and via our webpage www.edp.com. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 77.66-85.65: The call is expected to last no more than 60 minutes. I'll give now the floor to our interim CEO and also CFO, Miguel Estrela-Dandr√°. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 88.69-95.90: Hello, welcome everybody. Thanks for taking the call and I hope you had a good summer break. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 97.14-105.89: I'm pleased to present a pretty solid set of results for ADP this morning. You'll have seen it came out last night and to take you through it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 106.81-116.04: Maybe just before I go through some of the numbers, just to mention that COVID has definitely presented some challenges over these last few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 116.96-122.96: But I really think it also shows that the strong foundations of our business and the resilience and the robust response. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 123.58-127.39: Has allowed us to continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic business plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 128.95-133.31: To talk about the years of acquisition in Spain, which we announced in July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 133.51-142.94: That was a significant achievement for us and it really allows us to grow in activities that we believe are fully aligned with the energy transition, namely networks and renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.20-153.27: We also continue to see important regulatory developments and a growing public support for the green agenda technologies in our core markets in Europe and the U.S. I think that's come out also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 153.29-155.48: Very intensely over the last couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 157.12-162.30: And while I think we've also felt the impact of the COVID pandemic, it's also been really a catalyst. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 162.94-169.71: Progress in an area where we're very well positioned to generate additional value and more opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 169.73-173.97: In a couple of months, but I think it's also highlighted the strength of our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 176.04-181.96: So let's go to the presentation in terms of the highlights for the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 183.02-189.59: So in this period, EFTA fell 3% year on year to around 1.9 billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 190.61-200.60: So on one hand, Deep Intox benefited from the recovery of the hydro in Iberia to close to the historic average in the first half of 2020, so compared to a very dry first half of 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 201.44-203.90: So the hydro factor is approximately 1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 205.31-212.89: We also had very robust results in the energy management segment and this was driven by our hedging strategy in the energy markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 213.93-219.56: This benefited obviously from the significant decline in the energy prices and the increase in the energy market's volatility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 222.12-230.09: However, we also saw some negative pressure on EBITDA from depreciation of the Brazilian real and the contraction of the electricity demand in some of our key markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 231.33-237.90: Obviously this affected both our supply operations in Iberia and also the performance in our distribution business in Brazil where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 237.92-241.52: Well, and bundled, as you know, the supply and distribution are essentially... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 241.54-242.68: So, stay with me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 244.16-249.67: In terms of recurring net profit, this increased by 8% to 509 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 250.59-256.38: This was exclusively driven by the Iberian business at an increase of 120 million Euros, so it almost doubled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.46-260.64: So I think this is a really strong performance from the Darbury Business Institute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 261.44-265.02: This more than compensated EDPR and EDP Brazil's lower contribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 266.19-272.07: In addition, we also saw the average cost of debt improve by 70 basis points to 3.3%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 272.87-278.34: And this is essentially as we've seen more competitive refinancing costs compared to our maturing debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 280.10-286.87: Overall the reported net profit decreased by 22 percent. So this is dragged by non-recurring items in the first half of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 287.71-296.32: Essentially the key items here are the impairments in the coal assets following the closure of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 296.54-298.02: We now turn to light. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.74-302.96: And also the one-off cost of the hybrid phone we purchased, which we did in the first quarter of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 305.11-309.85: Net debt down 2% year to date to 14.1 billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.67-320.02: Obviously this reflects in the first half the payment of the annual dividend in the second quarter, which is a recurring event every year, so there's more pressure on the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 321.96-326.59: Also like to note that the net debt in June 2020 was flat versus June 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 327.17-331.85: So as a result, the race for the NFS E-Gitar was 3.7 times in June 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 332.23-341.58: Slightly above the 3.6 in December 19 and clearly below the 4.1 shown last year, June 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 343.46-349.39: In terms of cash flow, recurring organic cash flow rose 0.3 billion euros to a billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 349.81-356.88: It's obviously supported by better performance and activities in which we don't have partners or minority interests and also the lower interest costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 357.74-366.11: Despite the COVID restrictions, and I think this is important to note, our expansion investments continue to move forward at a good pace and they've reached around 0.8 billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 366.69-373.77: Of which almost 90% was allocated to new renewable projects and the remaining is the expansion of electricity networks in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 376.06-383.44: We've also made good progress on the implementation of our strategy post-June 2020. So as you know, we closed the agreement for acquisition of gears for the good valuation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 383.96-388.67: This includes, as you know, the long-term partnership with Macquarie for the electricity distribution business in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 389.49-398.32: Reinforces our regulated and long-term contracted risk profile. And we've had the opportunity to talk about this in detail in July, so I won't spend much time on this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.14-406.83: Obviously associated with this, we raised a billion euros for the right tissue, representing around 8.5% increase in share capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 407.29-413.75: I think this was well received by the markets, felt it was critical to support the VIA's requisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 414.53-419.16: I'll touch a little bit more on this later on, but I think the general perception was very positive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 420.56-427.45: Finally, we also announced over the last month two asset rotation deals totaling 1.1 billion euros of enterprise value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 428.03-435.84: So the first deal which we announced in mid-August was 240 MW in Spain at an easy multiple of 2.1 million Euros per MW. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.52-439.68: For a portfolio with an average age of nine years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 441.30-450.69: The second deal, which we announced this week, refers to 560 megawatts in the US, that is an EV of 2.1 million dollars per megawatt as of COD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 450.79-452.65: So I just highlighted it as a COD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 453.13-456.18: Is the reference that we should use. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 457.32-466.99: Implicit valuations in these transactions, they support the positive outlook that we've shared with you in the first quarter conference call. So I think just reinforcing this trend that we've had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.45-473.59: Let's move forward to the next slide, so on EBITDA, the breakdown by business platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 474.85-484.84: So as I mentioned, consolidated EBITDA down 3% year on year, but it would have been flat if we excluded the 4x impact, namely the Brazilian real, which depreciated 20% versus the euro. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 485.63-490.23: Within renewables and despite the 80% increase in our hydro production in Iberia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 492.65-501.02: Of 4% below historical average, the hydro, the EBITDA had an 8% decline, mainly due to the decline in the wind and the solar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.22-508.19: This in turn is explained by the wind resource in our global wind farms portfolio with 9% below long term average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 509.89-512.89: The average capacity and operation decreased by 6%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.09-521.38: And this is essentially due to the after rotation last year of 51% stake in a 1 GW wind portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 521.40-523.14: Relative impact to be available. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 523.62-526.95: 87 million euro year on year impact on EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 527.91-532.41: Obviously at the net profit level this is much less relevant since it's also post-minority. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 534.27-542.44: Finally, the decrease in asset rotation gains by 74 million euros year on year. So in the first half of 2020, the asset rotation gains were 145 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 543.44-553.39: And reflecting valuation and the shareholding adjustments from the transfer of most of our offshore wind assets. The new 50-50 wind offshore joint venture with ENGIE. As you know, it's called Ocean Wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 555.82-561.62: The 7% fall in IPATAS is mostly related to the depreciation of the Brazilian real. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 562.42-565.75: In local currency, the Tafam networks in Brazil grew 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 566.01-572.89: Supported by the expansion of the transmission activities, mitigating the 8% decline of electricity demand in our distribution areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.53-581.30: In Iberia, EBITDA evolution reflects the decline of regulated returns in Portugal to 4.9% roughly, and in Spain to around 6%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 583.54-592.31: Finally, the improvement in client solutions and energy management. I think this is a strong improvement. It's fully driven by the positive hedging results in Iberia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.15-596.74: Partially offset by the 17% declining EBITDA from supply in Iberia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 597.34-600.44: Mostly given the contraction in electricity supply volumes by 7%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 601.28-611.25: So this was most relevant in the B2B segment, where the decrease in volume is reaching 14 percent and was only partially mitigated by the 1.5 percent increment in the B2C segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 613.23-617.40: So let's move forward to the next slide on financing costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 619.34-623.10: So here, interest costs down 60%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 623.12-629.93: Supported by a 70 basis points decline in the average cost of net debt, as I mentioned, and a 6% decrease in the average debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 631.23-640.84: Now, this better performance can be due to the more active debt management, as the rates of maturing debt were much higher than those for new financing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.96-641.98: We've got this here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.64-648.49: But it's also, to mention, it's also a significant reduction in the short-term rates in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 649.65-656.18: So as you can see here on the table on the right-hand side, we continue to have some short-term death maturities with relatively high rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 656.80-663.64: That will be maturing over the next quarter. So this should continue to support the downward trend on the average cost of debt over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 664.56-673.83: And this is something I think we've been flagging, and you guys have also asked us about this for the last year or so, and I think we're seeing that flowing through now, the P&L. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 675.62-679.24: Let's move forward to the next slide on recurring net profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 681.76-688.57: So here the negative effects impact of EBITDA is obviously more diluted at the EBIT level and even more at the net profit level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.31-693.27: We typically fund our operations in the local currency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 694.15-703.74: Below EBIT, there's a positive impact from lower net financing costs and there's also lower minority interest, both at EDPR and EDP Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 704.86-709.25: This is partially offset by a slight increase in effective income tax. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 709.93-714.03: So overall recurring net profit up 8% to 509 million euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 715.00-722.22: Reported net profit significantly impacted by the reasons I've already mentioned, namely coal and the repurchase of the hybrid bond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 724.32-731.21: Let's move now to strategy execution and just a few slides on this and a few key messages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 732.15-738.98: Just quickly recapping what we've done since we announced our strategic update back in March 19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 739.60-745.73: I think we've really shown in this period, it's basically a year and a half, that we've been front-loading the execution of this plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 746.01-751.49: So this has been really important, particularly given what's happened over the last couple of months with COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 752.09-761.10: Because we've managed to really lock in a lot of value creation and put us on the right path to extract value from growth opportunities that we've been developing now for a number of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 762.36-763.88: And renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 763.94-766.75: Know, 84% of the 7 gigawatts targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 766.87-774.13: For the spirits, long-term contracts. We're well positioned now for accelerated growth in Europe and the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 774.69-781.44: Brazil delivering on the transmission project ahead of the regulatory schedule, even taking into account the COVID restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 782.80-790.77: Years ago, stronger presence in activities aligned with the energy transition in our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 790.85-794.53: I think also with significant number of skin issues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.50-802.36: Regarding poor total optimization, so we've already closed or agreed more than 55% of the 4 billion proceeds related to gas and rotation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 803.30-813.19: On top of that, we've announced 2.7 billion proceeds from two disposals in Iberia, so the six hydro plants in Portugal and the two CGTs in the B2C supply portfolio in Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 815.08-820.86: So overall, I think we consider this proactive portfolio restructuring as being a major source of value creation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.76-827.21: On the balance sheet obviously reinforces the billion euros of white tissue as mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 827.69-833.31: To reinforce the low operating risk profile with increased weight of funds for the regulated activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.89-841.10: On efficiency fully on track to meet the targets in our strategic plan, OPEC's decreasing 3% year on year in the first half of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 841.52-844.56: Obviously part of that to do with COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 845.00-854.93: But it also really allows us to accelerate some of these savings given increased digitalization and also greater operational efficiency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 855.14-858.20: That we were redesigning during this period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.78-861.42: And it's a boost in that respect as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.06-871.17: On shareholder remuneration. So we're comfortable with the sustainability of our dividend policy as you know, the 19 cents floor, target payout 75-35%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.75-877.44: And we're completely committed to reinforcing our green position and accelerating our decarbonization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.60-882.12: So that's a key part of our strategy and it will continue to be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 883.20-890.79: In the first half of 2020, 80% of our electricity production came from renewables, and our CO2 emissions factor decreased by 57%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 890.87-897.06: Obviously this was very much supported by the 74% contraction in co-production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 898.46-905.69: Our reposition is also reinforced not only by the closure of coal, but also involvement in some of the energy transition projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 906.61-914.81: Including we're participating in a green hydrogen project in Portugal. We have some storage projects under analysis for SOTUS 3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 915.38-922.46: We also have some renewable projects that we're intending to develop in the Viesgos coal sites, which are being decommissioned in the south of Spain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.68-926.27: Definitely repositioning is extremely important for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 927.97-933.53: Let's just move forward to the next slide. So just a quick note here on the right tissue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 933.71-937.52: So as you know, it was successful, 8.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 937.54-944.88: I won't dwell much on this, but I think the market reaction to the operation shows the merits of the combined acquisition and the right to issue deals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 946.49-949.99: How does that say that? Okay, let's choose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.83-953.75: We move forward to the next slide, slide 10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 954.73-962.82: I think this is an interesting slide. It shows how we've been active in reshaping our Iberian portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 963.72-969.45: So just reminding you, in December we announced the disposal of six hydro plants in Portugal for the 2.2 billion euros. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 969.97-976.26: Already gotten the EU merger control approval and we believe the Portuguese regulatory approvals are also on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.06-981.34: In May, we had the sale to Total over the CQs in the B2C portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 981.86-990.81: EU merger control already approved this transaction as you know, last couple of weeks. And the transaction and the restructuring in CARB-out of the assets is ongoing, so again, on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.55-996.58: And then in July we also announced the acquisition of Viesgo, a more recent deal, so it's still ongoing approvals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.18-999.52: Both the European and Spanish. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 999.54-1002.20: Regulatory level, but again... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1002.50-1011.65: We think that's on track and we expect that to be done by the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect all of these transactions to be completed in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1013.81-1024.64: As we indicated in the strategic update, so the overall aim of the group is to reduce merchant price exposure and to really enhance the visibility of our revenue by increasing our long-term contracted assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1025.25-1028.37: So I think these recent transactions are a really strong step in this direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1029.95-1037.52: A note here just regarding the integrated industrial project for vehicles. So we're already working on a plan to be implemented in the first hundred days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.62-1042.16: And expected kickoff just after the financial closing of the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1042.22-1050.33: But this is something we already have the team working on this and fully developing the 100-day plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1052.33-1058.72: Let's just move on to slide 11. Maybe a note here on the after rotation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1059.64-1065.13: So these last couple of weeks have been really busy for the teams here in terms of finalizing these deals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1066.01-1073.81: So back in August we announced the sale of 240 MW as I mentioned in Spain, 2.1 million per MW. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1074.67-1084.08: By comparison, our previous asset rotation deal in April was at around a multiple of 1.6, so significant top listing value despite a slightly older portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.11-1091.31: I think you hear the messages, a lot of competition, despite the COVID situation, and very attractive place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1092.79-1097.34: This week we announced the sale of an 80% stake in a 560-megawatt portfolio in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.08-1104.64: It offers both wind and solar, but an implicit PV multiple of 2.1 million dollars per megawatt as the COD as I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1105.51-1114.45: If we only consider the wind assets, the multiple would be around $2.4 million per megawatt, so that's also a significant increase versus our previous transaction in North America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.46-1123.08: So obviously the multiple expansion in these transactions is not only due to the lower interest rates both in Europe and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1123.24-1129.41: You know the 10-year government bond yields are declined by about 1% in Spain and about 2% in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1130.25-1140.78: But we continue to see, as I mentioned, strong appetite among institutional investors for these green assets with regulated or long-term contracted revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1140.96-1145.01: So I think there's a strong market there for the product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1146.95-1150.81: Let's move forward to slide 12, so here in terms of build-out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1151.87-1161.48: Despite the COVID, we've managed to keep a strong execution of the BPAs. We have 84% of the 7 gigawatts, as I mentioned. In terms of project delivery,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1162.24-1171.05: There have been postponements, as you know, as we mentioned earlier, imposed by COVID on some construction activities and also on the manufacturer's value chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.75-1181.52: In some cases, this could imply some delays for up to around 500 megawatts of wind, which we had under construction in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.80-1186.11: For 2020, it might slip from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1186.89-1192.93: I don't think this has any impact or material impact from an evaluation perspective. The PTCs will still be there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1194.05-1198.72: So it's really just, this DOD will be beginning of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1200.62-1207.85: As you know, there was this extension for the PTC versus the previous target of December 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1208.47-1211.31: So we're pretty comfortable there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.09-1215.64: In relation to installed capacity by 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1215.66-1224.99: The number should be offset by the consolidation of the 500 megawatts of wind capacity coming from Vierzgo, which in other words, an answer to closing is also expected before year-end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1226.93-1236.18: Regarding offshore wind, JV is done, so established ocean winds, as you know, brings positive impact because of the assets that were transferred. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1236.88-1238.52: And the revaluations that were done. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1239.18-1246.57: Two remaining efforts to be transferred from our side, Mayflower in the U.S. And Windflows in Portugal before the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1247.21-1251.57: And on Angie's side, the C-Mate in Belgium, which is also expected to be put under this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1253.03-1257.94: In addition to our project, the Wind Flows Atlantic, this was commissioned in the summer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1258.96-1266.03: I think it's an interesting milestone for the offshore industries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1266.47-1269.11: The largest turbine ever installed on a floating platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1269.99-1271.85: And the two projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1271.99-1273.33: The morning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.35-1280.26: Also in relation to offer two other projects that are pretty advanced stage of construction, so CMADE in Belgium and MORI in the UK. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1280.28-1285.27: Also going to be good references for offshore targets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1285.83-1289.33: So they continue to evolve in line with the construction schedules and I think that's on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1291.95-1301.32: Let's move on to slide 13. Here's just a more high-level note on additional opportunities on the green recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1302.08-1309.75: I think we've seen important developments and public support for the green technologies in general and obviously for Berlin in particular. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.83-1312.03: In Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1312.05-1318.58: A number of mechanisms have been designed by European institutions to support the economy, the environment, digitalization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.10-1323.32: Basically aiming to promote a recovery based on a more sustainable economic model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1323.76-1328.31: So this really fits well with our strategy. I think we're really well positioned to benefit from it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1329.33-1335.52: Overall, the National Energy Plan's estimate of our 340 gigawatts of new onshore wind and solar capacity by 2030. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.98-1340.68: Of which 55% correspond to the eight European countries where we're already present. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.86-1348.59: It's important also not to forget other investments that will be key, namely the hydro, electric mobility, smart grids, where we've also been very active. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1348.77-1352.41: I think in general good news for where we are strategically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1354.07-1357.34: The European institutions also created the Just Transition Fund. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.36-1370.23: Which can also be used to support the region affected by the coal plant shutdown. So I think this will also be an added incentive to accelerate this transition and really accelerate the shutdown of coal and moving to renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.95-1375.68: In the US, definitely we benefit from the access of the PTCs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.74-1382.10: And also some pretty ambitious energy transition policies that will be discussed in the run-up to November's election. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1382.66-1388.05: Again, pretty exciting times I think for the green economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1389.85-1397.88: So now let's move to slide 14 and just a word on Brazil. Brazil's obviously been significantly impacted by the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.72-1406.53: But I think it's also been interesting to see that the Brazilian institutions have reacted in, I think, a really solid way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1406.97-1412.15: To create several mechanisms to support electricity companies and sectors and the consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.09-1414.49: So just to highlight a couple of these. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1415.30-1422.60: The distribution, and I would like to mention the creation of the COVID account, so this increases liquidity for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1423.56-1430.53: It's also a pass-through of costs related to the estimated COVID impact. It's the surplus of long-term contracted electricity volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1431.49-1435.58: So last July, EDP Brazil got a franchisee in around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1436.42-1441.84: 600 million riyals referring to the COVID accounts which reinforce the financial liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.52-1445.47: It was a good measure for the sector as a whole in order to be benefited from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.61-1452.13: In generation, there was a recent approval by the Senate of new legislation to solve the GFW issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.63-1455.58: I think this is a critical step to reduce the regulatory uncertainty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1456.42-1462.52: The presidential approval which is required to proceed with the release of the detailed rules from the regulator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1463.28-1473.17: The solution involves the extension of the concession periods for some hydro plants in exchange for some up-front payments that will solve some pending financial settlements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.19-1475.54: Souls come uncertain if you get existed until now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1476.66-1479.74: So I think that's also an important step that took place in August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1480.72-1486.23: In transmission, we have some delays in the construction works given COVID, but construction has resumed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1486.41-1491.07: 71% of the total CAPMIX for the six transmission lines was already executed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1491.95-1500.10: Last month we announced the completion of the second part of the lot 11 in the Medinan state. It's fully operational now, 12 months ahead of the regulatory schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1501.00-1505.69: And regarding future transmission options, we'll obviously continue to review opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1507.45-1513.21: But we'll also be disciplined in the way that we approach these, as you know we are when we go into these options. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1515.62-1521.64: Looking at the macro environment, strong depreciation of Brazilian real, so that worsens our financial. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1522.64-1529.93: But also some positive indicators from a macro view in Brazil, namely really low interest rates, I mean record low interest rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1530.35-1540.16: The benchmark rate is recently reset at 2% by the Brazilian central bank. So in that sense also greatly reducing the funding cost in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1542.28-1543.54: In March 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.13-1552.97: So, beginning of the crisis, Brazil took several preventive measures to protect its financial liquidity. I won't see those. There were a lot of uncertainties at the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1553.47-1558.46: So they initially cut the dividend proposal and had some capex postponements and increased the credit lines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1559.14-1567.43: As a result, they had a very strong financial liquidity of 3.4 billion Riyals, low leverage of around two times that of EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1568.49-1575.72: But given the strong position, things seem to be recovering. Brazil just now announced a share buyback program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1575.74-1580.54: Clarification on this dividend policy, setting the dividend for one real per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.56-1582.58: 50% payout on the adjustment profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1582.70-1587.43: So this is very much in line with the different proposals announced by Brazil in March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.65-1594.15: Withdrawn because of the COVID, but we're now reaffirming that and maintaining that for the next three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1596.70-1605.23: In the press release that the company made, it was also stated that the absence of investment opportunities in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1605.35-1607.45: Brazil has attractive conditions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1607.63-1612.37: The remaining cash flow would be distributed either as buybacks or additional dividends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.47-1619.32: But basically the idea is to have an optimized capital structure in Brazil and make sure that it's efficient. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1621.96-1629.87: So let's just move to slide 15 and talk a little bit about something that I know also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.97-1637.46: Those already mentioned, we had pretty solid results in energy management in the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1637.76-1642.98: This compensated the negative effects from weaker volumes and lower energy prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1643.98-1650.19: For the rest of the year, we expect much lower energy management results, below the average of the last five semesters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1650.95-1655.10: So really the first half, and particularly the first quarter, was exceptionally good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.42-1663.16: And obviously going forward, so for the remaining month of the year, the second half,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1663.18-1669.99: I mean it will be, the reason for this is on the back of Heijin, it's got to do with fusionality and basically the recovery of energy prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1670.91-1676.68: Just sort of to remind you that this expectation is already reflected in our guidance which we've been providing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.04-1685.97: Also in relation to 21 and also something I'd like to highlight, and we've been doing that over the last couple of months, is we are reducing our merchant exposure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1686.37-1693.77: Disposal of the hydrate, as I mentioned, CCG, CCG plant, the B2C portfolio, the shutdown of the coal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.29-1698.48: So all of this contributes to reducing our emergence exposure in Liberia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1700.50-1707.35: We also have now almost 100% of our hydro and nuclear production hedged at an average price of around 45 Euros per megawatt hour. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1707.57-1716.50: So this is the line with the four devices. And 60% of our expected gas production, CCGT production, at mid-single digits spread on average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.48-1723.02: So this is essentially 2021. Pretty much locked in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1724.74-1730.09: So let's just quick measure on slide 16 on impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1730.79-1739.98: Just to say, as I've mentioned before, it really shows that throughout this really challenging time, we have shown a lot of resilience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.72-1741.88: That's the trickle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1741.96-1751.03: The second quarter of 2020 was particularly tough in terms of the lockdown, in terms of the impact on the economy, and I think despite that we were able to have a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1751.17-1753.37: All of his old. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1754.19-1758.56: Of course, this has to do also with the adaption capacity of the company, but also our people. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1758.96-1765.53: So there's a lot of focus here on the business plan execution throughout this period, despite the lockdown and everyone being remote. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.19-1768.53: There's a lot of support for our suppliers, the clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1768.57-1776.90: I mean, just some of the communities. So I think in general, we try to really have a holistic stakeholder view here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1777.52-1783.88: And this translated also into good quality of service also, even in terms of both supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1785.23-1793.93: Coming out of this, I think there's really an opportunity to take some of the lessons learned and benefit not only from an efficiency point of view, some of it's irrelevant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.75-1796.20: Of digitalization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1797.04-1798.50: But I think also new ways of work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.88-1808.55: And so I think this is really making us also reflect on how we, even post-pandemic, how we'll reflect that in the way that people interact here in the office and everything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1809.19-1813.35: And so I think that will bring a lot of benefit also in terms of motivation for our team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1815.96-1818.88: Last slide, and let's just move into summary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.68-1828.31: So we're maintaining the financial guidance that we shared with you just a month ago in the DPS requisition and the right to issue presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1829.29-1836.54: So despite 2020 being difficult for COVID, we are keeping our solidarity resilient. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1837.24-1843.50: Recurring EBITDA of 3.6 billion, recurring net income of 0.85, 0.9 target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1844.54-1853.35: As you know, our recurring net profit assumes a status of non-recurring, so if you take that out, we're sort of at .8, including the SES. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.95-1864.92: In terms of the deals we expect to do in the fourth quarter, we expect to conclude in the fourth quarter, I think that will be the policy for the post-2020 period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.57-1870.05: So we see the years go clearly earnings enhancing, significant value from the industrial project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.73-1879.64: And also I think the better than expected terms of the aspirin rotation deals also allow us to take a more optimistic view versus our strategic plan assumptions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.00-1882.90: Regarding the transactions over the next couple of years, so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.36-1888.01: Still have around two billion, slightly less than that, to do over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1888.03-1894.51: Years I think what we've seen in terms of the atherotation over the last 18 months, 24 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1894.81-1899.60: This has allowed us to be slightly more optimistic versus our business consumption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.38-1907.15: We also see improved growth opportunities for renewables, both wind onshore, offshore, solar, hybrid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1907.67-1916.32: They include also storage, green hydrogen, I think there's a lot of moving pieces here which I think will give us good opportunities to create value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1917.32-1923.36: Improved economics, a lot of public support both in Europe and in the US. So I think we have some tailwinds here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1924.92-1930.05: The portfolio restructuring and the focus growth in the long-term contracted and regular activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1930.63-1935.03: Also going to reduce our merchant's exposure and improve our low-risk profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1935.18-1937.48: And that's together with very supportive credit markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1937.72-1943.30: And lower yields for longer, which would allow us to also continue to reduce our average cost of debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1943.36-1949.87: So this overall combined effect allows us to feel comfortable about the dividend policies I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1950.75-1961.98: And so just generally I think we continue to see a very positive outlook regarding EDP's capacity to lead this energy transition and to really continue to create value for our stakeholders and our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.16-1972.53: So we obviously then have a couple of annexes. I'm not going to go through that, but you have a lot of the information we typically provide in other presentations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.03-1979.58: And we can refer to that in the Q&A if necessary. I'll just stop here and turn it back over to Michele Fionn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1982.12-1984.28: We can start now the Q&A session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.51-1988.11: Maybe we start with reading the questions on the phone, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1990.75-1996.84: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star 1 on your telephone to talk. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.72-2000.80: To cancel your question, please press star 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2001.78-2010.71: We will take our first question from Mr. Andolfo Alberto Gandolzi from Goldman Sachs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2012.59-2019.98: Thank you and good day everybody. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.08-2024.46: The first one is a bit pedantic and I apologize in advance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2024.60-2031.47: But just to be clear on your 3.6 billion EBITDA for 2020 and 0.85 to 0.9 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.93-2039.84: You call it recovering, I think out there there's different definitions by different people, analysts, investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.92-2048.53: Would you be so kind to tell us how much passive rotation or offshore GD gains you are including in there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2048.77-2052.47: And what one of costs do you include in there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.55-2060.00: I tell you this because you're talking about 190 million, one off cost from at the bottom line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.28-2065.25: You know, CNASH, the liability management, early purchases of bonds, and the extraordinary tax. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.53-2068.65: But you don't explain it here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2068.75-2073.57: That also not recurring so I was wondering you know how you treat that here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.89-2082.76: And lastly, you know, you're not really giving here a big COVID impact like some of your competitors. So I was wondering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2083.04-2093.73: Can you give us a million euro figure in bucks from COVID, you know, not currency but perhaps just volumes and maybe adjusted for some of the extra gains in energy management you have? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2094.07-2103.70: So it would be great to really get to a clean, clean, clean figure here to understand your underlying earnings power, which I believe is the key debate today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2104.64-2114.19: Second question, I'm really intrigued again by your comment that talked about 85% secured of the 7 gigawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2114.23-2120.12: And if I put that together with your recent balance sheet measures,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2120.88-2127.63: Very interesting the sentence you used there, you said we are well positioned for growth opportunities in Europe and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.17-2137.92: Can you elaborate on that? You know, the balance sheet of EDP by year end, once you close all those transactions, probably going to be $5 billion stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2138.36-2142.50: You know, really 5 billion broadly, so securitization, application, disposal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2143.66-2145.03: What are you going to do with all this money? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.19-2153.09: I mean, I guess, you know, growth opportunities you talk about are in renewable. Can you give us more? Tell us, what is the organization ready to deploy? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2153.19-2155.40: Is it going to three to three and a half? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.62-2160.00: 4GW within the next 3 years of gross capacity addition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2160.36-2165.29: I'm not asking you a preview of the CMD, but just trying to understand what's the potential here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.59-2166.85: Last question, very quick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2167.27-2171.77: Also quite surprised given that most of your enterprise values are renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2172.37-2177.46: You do not seem to show a pipeline here. Can you share it with us, a gross pipeline? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2177.74-2187.47: We know some projects will never materialize. We know some projects will. We know you need to keep every day working to beef up the pipeline, but can you tell us a snapshot where you are today? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.89-2198.64: Thank you. You're welcome. So in relation to your first question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2199.46-2205.21: Which is how much aspect rotation is in the recurring numbers I was talking about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2205.91-2212.71: So we're expecting that for the full year we should be close to 0.4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2213.43-2221.80: I think we had 145 in the first half and we've had two recent deals which will be closing in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2222.62-2225.25: I think from the multiples you can assume that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.89-2239.56: So there's obviously going to be relative capital gains associated with that. So I think we'll be well ahead of what was our initial expectation. That's allowing us to mitigate the impacts of the COVID, which was the second part of this question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.20-2244.46: After rotations close to point four. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2246.35-2252.19: And what I would like to highlight though also, it does show the recurring power of this business model. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.87-2259.56: Because it's not one, it's not two, it's not three, it's not four. It's already several transactions that we've been doing over the last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.00-2263.38: Couple of years or last time I left, two years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2263.40-2276.22: So the majority stakes where we have consistently shown are not only the market appetite for these assets, but also the interest and the sort of the attractiveness of these assets, which has obviously increased even during this period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.60-2280.34: Also, in this question in terms of one-off costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.10-2290.05: As I say, in Siena we're obviously impairing the asset value. We're also impairing some of the coal value and restructuring costs associated with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2290.93-2297.32: The liability management is what it is. It's obviously the hybrid to buy back with at the beginning of the year and the fares as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2298.22-2300.10: I think this was detailed in the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.76-2308.95: But essentially that's sort of the one-off, which is clearly signaled and is not part of these numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.85-2320.88: In relation to the Spanish cold, we'd already done that last year, so really the big scene is, the cold is really seen as now in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2322.28-2329.21: In relation to COVID, so we were obviously impacted by COVID and heavily impacted by COVID, everyone was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2332.37-2339.24: It has an impact at the data level, let's say, above 0.1 billion in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2340.14-2343.68: But then, don't forget, a lot of this was also in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2344.32-2348.49: So when it gets down to the net profit line, it's mitigated. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2349.19-2357.70: In Liberia, it also impacted our commercial business, but that was also mitigated by part of our energy management. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2357.72-2362.24: I certainly wouldn't draw this assumption. On the contrary, we were heavily impacted by COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.96-2372.47: But fortunately we also had other levers which then allowed us to mitigate that impact. So on a recurring basis we ended up in a good place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2373.97-2378.18: In relation to your second question, so the role position for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2379.16-2384.34: And I think we're focused on the business plan. As I mentioned, we're still at 84%. You can look at it as where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2384.88-2389.75: Positive we're at 84, we can say that we still have some work to do to get to 100%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.73-2397.80: We would look at going to the market at the beginning of 2021 and providing an update on how we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2397.82-2401.98: We see the company going forward for the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2403.58-2406.05: And we would then be able to elaborate a little bit more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2406.53-2409.63: But just also in relation to this question, I think it's a relevant point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.45-2419.46: I mean our balance sheet will be at the end of the year where we wanted it to be. In other words, we are still a triple B minus rating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.18-2423.56: And we have the objective of trying to move to a triple B rating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2424.30-2429.91: And so that means that we need to be consistent in the way that we move in this direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2430.51-2431.95: The transactions we're doing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2433.03-2442.78: Are allowing us to get a little bit more freedom and to move towards the triple V. It doesn't mean we suddenly have a huge amount of space. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2442.94-2449.35: And so we are moving in the right direction but on track, so in line with what we expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2449.45-2455.24: So I'd say that's in relation to the capacity for more growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.54-2460.40: I'd like to probably answer that when we do a full sort of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2460.64-2474.19: When we can take all the different pieces, put them together and have a sort of a solid, coherent plan rather than just answering the part of it in relation to specific to renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2475.84-2483.38: In growth pipeline, for the third question, you're right. We don't typically provide a lot of information on pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2485.03-2488.11: Obviously, as we go on closing the PPAs, we provide that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2488.55-2497.72: We have a very large pipeline which has allowed us to feed, and it's basically a funnel, and I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past, and some of the conversations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2498.44-2505.55: That sometimes you need to be developing this pipeline for four, five, 60 years in different geographies until you actually get it to maturity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2506.45-2509.95: So we don't provide that information, but... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2509.97-2519.90: But I think the fact that we are able to deliver the DPAs and deliver the growth shows that it's a pretty solid pipeline that we have that's backing that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.66-2525.37: Sorry, Miguel, just to be clear on the first answer, and thank you, that was very comprehensive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2525.55-2528.69: So you have 400 million gains from rotation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2528.75-2536.06: Before taxes and those not very high tax rate here and then you have 200 million one-off call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2536.14-2540.60: One hundred million volume cost on both on a pre-tax basis and on a non-tax basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2540.66-2542.98: And on the 100 million sum of their big charges. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2543.18-2544.74: So it's kind of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2544.97-2546.65: Think EBITDA would be for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.75-2548.25: Of games and 300. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.41-2558.32: Yeah. Thank you. Roughly. Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.23-2571.35: We will take our next question from the line of Harry Weibert from Bank of America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2574.51-2575.54: Everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2575.80-2579.84: Questions from me please. So first to you, I'm afraid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2579.90-2582.92: Also on the guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2583.08-2589.17: I just kind of sense when rewinding back to May at your first quarter results,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2589.19-2594.27: It's a fairly positive update and I think certainly my interpretation was that the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2594.29-2603.12: The wind was sort of more blowing towards potentially this year coming out ahead of guidance and you sort of updated it and the range you've given to it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.14-2605.99: Perhaps a touch below if you've done tick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2607.09-2609.23: What I'm interested in is what's changing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2609.29-2617.40: This sort of alluded to a less good outlook in the second half for Iberia retail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2618.26-2622.58: So compared to where we were when we were last speaking in sort of early to mid-May,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2623.18-2632.43: What's really changed in the second half? Has there been a sort of negative movement in the outlook for retail or any other part of the business that perhaps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2632.97-2637.54: It means less looking at a guidance upgrade or beat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.24-2643.60: Or is it just that the COVID impacts are actually bigger than what you'd anticipated back in May? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2644.86-2650.15: Second one, sort of very granular, so mainly yes, no questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2650.19-2658.86: 0.85 to 0.9 guidance and the 0.4 of gains includes an assumption for the remaining. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.88-2665.25: Assets that are going to be folded into the NGJV or would that be upside to those figures? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.23-2671.81: And what are you assuming for the US dollar in your 0.85 to 0 point? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2672.03-2677.52: At 9. So is that based upon a mark to market as of today? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2679.34-2685.63: And then third and final question just on the legal case. So as I understand it, there's now... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.65-2690.97: A potential legal case where EDP would be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2690.99-2692.01: At the time of mention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2693.83-2694.93: Can you just... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2694.95-2700.32: Help us understand the timeline on that case is that something that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2700.44-2709.85: Is expected perhaps to drag on for years or tens of years or is this something that you think could come to a head relatively quickly? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2714.57-2720.00: Okay, thanks for the questions. So maybe on... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2721.08-2724.88: Positives and negatives versus May. So I think in May we were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2725.03-2732.37: We'd already tried to factor in a lot of the moving pieces, which, as you know, as I mentioned earlier, we were hit hard by COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2732.71-2737.04: There are also some positives that we were already beginning to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2737.84-2742.32: And so we built that into our view at the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2744.48-2747.97: Positive, we have already seen the lower interest rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.17-2757.86: We were seeing already higher gains in the acid rotation. Some of the negatives that have been highlighted over the last couple of months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2759.30-2761.46: A stronger devaluation of the Brazilian real. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2762.52-2768.81: And obviously the demand. So I think, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2769.61-2781.24: So, definitely those pieces have continued to move, but the positive ones we're already seeing, I think the Brazilian rail has continued to devalue a little bit further versus where we were in the last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2781.52-2782.98: I can make. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2783.70-2791.99: And in terms of the energy management also for the remaining part of the year, I think as I mentioned, we had an extraordinarily strong first quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2792.85-2801.98: Second quarter was good but obviously less strong and typically the second half of the year is less strong than the first half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2802.40-2805.91: So as I mentioned, that's also already all built into our target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2806.45-2813.51: We're already now in September, where you have the chance to incorporate the latest assumptions, and I think these positives and negatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2813.99-2816.58: Just to be comfortable with the guidance we provided amongst them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2818.44-2820.72: In relation to your question on the net profit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2821.06-2826.79: So yes, the guidance already assumes the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2826.87-2831.63: That may come in from moving the remaining projects into the JV, so that's also built in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2833.29-2840.54: It's essentially Mayflower and Seamaid which are the ones that will have the greatest impact in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2842.22-2850.63: So that's a relatively quick question. And I think you also asked about the Eurodollar. That's 1.15 roughly is what we were assuming for that forecast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2852.15-2858.10: In relation to a legal case, listen, there's not really very much I can add to what you said in the past. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2858.16-2866.35: The timeline is uncertain, but certainly it's something that we don't expect a lot of news in the short term. It could drag on, as you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2866.37-2870.97: And the legal cases in Portugal typically do drag on for a number of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2872.55-2876.04: If there's not any information that I can provide there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2877.70-2885.95: No news in this respect. August is a pretty slow month, judicial holidays, and so nothing more to say here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2887.99-2896.12: Just on the legal case, have you had to provision anything in your accounts for that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2896.98-2903.06: I'll be very clear about that. We have not provisioned and we have no intention of provisioning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2903.70-2909.39: I mean, there's in fact, there's not even any number out there that we could possibly even... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2909.41-2913.95: Try to understand what, have a reference for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2914.01-2920.00: No provision, no intention of provisioning, and not even a reference that exists. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2925.75-2927.07: To the next question on the phone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2932.07-2933.77: From a line of half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2940.90-2950.37: So now the next question comes from Manuel Palom. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.14-2960.00: Good morning everyone, thanks for taking my question. I've just got. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2961.34-2968.87: Two questions, well one regarding Portugal in which I will ask you to please update us on the latest on the Stalinist attacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2969.69-2974.75: And two related to recent options. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2974.91-2983.54: What's your view on the results from that auction and why you did not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2983.56-2985.53: A game in here or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2985.87-2994.17: While you were not awarded any of these projects under the different optionalities for the auction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2994.99-3004.34: And again, I'm not trying to preview your CMV in the future, but I was wondering whether you could tell us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3004.40-3012.71: What is the run rate in terms of installations that EVPR could do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3012.77-3019.44: Are you already at the peak of that or do you see still some room for improvement? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3019.84-3022.34: In the coming future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3026.43-3030.75: So in relation to the Portuguese regulation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3033.51-3040.74: Essentially we have the three different topics that we typically talk about, which is the sales, the callback, and the social tariff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3042.00-3046.29: I would say that in relation to the extraordinary tax. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3047.03-3054.15: There's a commitment to have this evolve and that was set out in the government budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3054.17-3058.04: For the year that it should be reduced in line with the system debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3058.78-3066.09: Unfortunately, this coincided with the COVID, and so the system debt is actually not expected to decline this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3068.41-3076.48: We do expect it to continue to decline going forward because the COVID is obviously a one-off impact, so it creates short-term pressure this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3077.08-3079.90: But then we continue when we look forward, when we project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3079.92-3082.58: Of the task going forward and the system debt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3082.62-3088.35: We continue to see it's completely sustainable and will fall away over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3088.39-3096.62: So in that respect, I think that political commitment is still there and it's a question now of following this and seeing how it evolves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3097.38-3098.48: In relation to the callback. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3098.60-3107.69: Again, I think some positive news on that, which we hope will come out over the next couple of weeks maybe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3110.33-3124.68: Essentially, some steps were taken, as you know, the Secretary of State has already mentioned that we should net off the sales and the social tariff against the callback. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3124.86-3133.13: And so that now needs to be detailed and reflected in specific regulatory processes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3133.29-3139.58: Regulation and that's being done so hopefully we'll have some news coming out of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3140.30-3145.21: In terms of the social tariff, not really any news on that, so no change there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3146.21-3147.81: So that's Portuguese regulation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3148.63-3157.38: In terms of solar auction, we obviously go to these auctions and we participate the same way we participate in many other auctions around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3158.66-3164.02: We do our best, we set up the teams, we try to find the locations, we use our pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3165.05-3171.47: But then we're also disciplined about what we see as the returns that we expect for these type of projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3171.51-3181.42: And so we'll go in and we'll have a price that we're willing to go to and then it goes beyond that and we'll step out and we'll invest elsewhere. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3183.14-3192.73: I think it was interesting to see the solar auction. So obviously we'd also participated last year. We were awarded not in the auction but afterwards with the project there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3193.31-3201.26: This year it had a particularity which is you could also bid with storage. So 75% of the solar of the 700 megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3201.56-3205.99: Ended up being taken in the modality which is solar plus storage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3206.21-3212.97: That ended up being extremely competitive and on a CFD basis if we had to do a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3212.99-3219.86: In one case it was 11 Euros per megawatt hour and in some cases it could even potentially be negative. So very aggressive prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3220.46-3229.01: I have to also mention here that half of those megawatts were won by a South Korean company which is also a producer of panels and storage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3229.03-3233.57: So they may have a different view on the economics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3234.09-3239.76: And so they were able to be more competitive there. Can't really tell, but I guess it would be a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3239.78-3245.85: It's certainly interesting to try and understand a little bit more of those economics there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3246.57-3254.61: But it's part of life. We go to these auctions, we win some, we lose some, and that's just how we approach this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3255.84-3258.46: In relation to the question on the run rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3258.86-3268.43: So clearly we're ramping up, as you know, in renewables. We were at a run rate of around 700 megawatts, and we're ramping up to around 2 gigawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.57-3274.11: We have the pipeline, and I think that's something that we've all stressed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3274.13-3280.98: The big change, I think, strategically that we had was to build as much as we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3283.08-3286.59: And then if necessary sell part of it to continue to recycle that capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3287.79-3297.48: From an organizational perspective, we've also been ramping up. We've been hiring a lot of people. We've been sort of building up the organization, obviously, to match that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3297.70-3307.23: This year we would be already, obviously now with the COVID it's been slightly delayed, the number of megawatts we're building this year, but we'd already be getting close to the two gigawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3307.31-3311.85: So within the 1.5 to 1.9 type range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3312.71-3317.56: I think some of those may have slipped into 2021, but I think the organization is there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3318.18-3320.08: So we continue to ramp up the organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3320.42-3329.89: I think we have the heart of it, the core that we already had in terms of energy assessment, in terms of the relationship with the turbine manufacturers. So I think that's there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3330.31-3338.26: And so we're really fleshing out in the different markets and in the markets where we already are to make sure we can continue to deliver those megawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3339.84-3343.48: I mean, this is all just to say we're comfortable with the run rate of the 2 gigawatts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3344.80-3350.55: I'd wait to see sort of the full PMD to talk about any other numbers apart from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3353.15-3360.16: We'll try now to answer some questions from the web. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3361.88-3369.97: We have here some questions regarding the VNGO acquisition in terms of integration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3370.25-3375.76: So, Stefano Bezzato from Credit Suisse and Jorge Guimaraes from GB Capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3375.80-3381.42: Are you in position to provide more detail on the expected synergies and tax benefits from the combination with the ESGO? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3381.84-3384.98: Is now possible to provide more details to you about special synergies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3386.63-3388.77: Also work along with the spin the same direction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.03-3398.40: So, as I mentioned, we're focused now on some executing DMNA, I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3398.44-3404.12: In trying to get that closed by the end of the year and getting this through the different regulatory hurdles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3405.39-3411.13: We're also, in parallel, working on the integration plan for the first 100 days. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3411.53-3418.18: This will be basically doubling our size, more than doubling our size in networks for permanent concessions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3418.50-3425.83: Be combining two industrial projects. So obviously I think we can all intuitively understand that this has a lot of value creation potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3428.35-3434.21: I've seen some of the numbers from some of you guys, some outside analysts, and we're comfortable with those numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3434.61-3438.18: I think they're aligned with the benchmark for these kind of fuels. Certainly are internal numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3438.96-3444.86: Which would not be very different from those, but I really can't share much more detail than that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3445.43-3452.91: I would just also say in relation to the tax issue, I mean obviously since we will have more than 75% in the distribution holding company.
