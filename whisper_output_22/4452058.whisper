asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.51-1639.66: Do I understand correctly that the outlook for H2 seems to be a little bit tougher than what you expected probably one or two months ago? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1640.00-1649.41: And that you need to invest more than expected to achieve the same GMB number. I just wanted to check if I understood that right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1650.37-1654.23: My second question would be on the tick rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.29-1665.41: For 2Q, can you please give us some indication on the tech rate and also help us probably understand, it looks like it dropped a little bit.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1697.90-1704.52: I just wanted to understand if that has reversed into Q3 and what you attribute this to.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1709.01-1717.16: Thank you, thank you, Smeeza, for your question. For the first one, also, whether the output looks tougher or not.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.04-1764.42: Mainly due to underlying dynamics in revenue growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1764.64-1773.19: This 2.4 pp decline in gross contribution margin is driven by, as you said, strategic margin investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1773.21-1778.34: In certain categories like electronics to fortify our market position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.36-1783.32: And in non-electronics to drive further frequencies by our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1783.74-1792.65: And also into CRM, which we call this as temporary margin investment, and this will be gradually reduced throughout the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1792.99-1801.36: And also shifting electronic GMB into 3P, meaning marketplace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1801.80-1811.53: We sold more electronics from the marketplace unit and therefore this affected our gross contribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.95-1817.80: And finally, the discounts given to our customers to widen and... Sorry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1818.12-1824.74: To continue widen our selection with expanding merchant base and competitive prices in the market.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1835.66-1842.44: Lower margin products, those lower margin products are mainly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.48-1848.37: Gadgets, appliances, bluetooth devices and robot vacuum cleaners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1848.43-1854.09: And also once the electronic product shifts into the GMB,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.25-1857.56: Mostly those products consist of appliances. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1857.58-1864.66: Mobile devices and technology devices which has lower margin compared to non-electronic devices.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.34-1890.17: But we have always been prioritizing our growth to create long-term value by attracting more customers, increasing our order frequency and adding more merchants, expanding our selection of catalogs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.19-1894.98: Maintaining price competitiveness and scaling our new strategic assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1896.70-1900.02: Thank you.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1910.63-1912.39: Hi everyone, thanks for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1912.77-1920.38: I firstly just following up on the take rate, you mentioned that you've seen a shift from electronics from 1p to 3p. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.66-1925.63: I'm wondering what has been driving that and do you see that specifically as a permanent shift? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1926.53-1930.01: And then also just on the discounts that you also mentioned as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1930.29-1937.58: How much of this was driven by any competitive pressures? Were there more competitive pressures than you anticipated at the start of the quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1937.60-1941.82: And if you could just comment on the sort of current competitive environment that you're seeing at the moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1942.54-1951.83: And then finally, just on the payments, I think you mentioned there that the development was ahead of expectations. If you could just give us a bit more color on that, that would be great. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1954.53-1959.30: Thank you Miriam. For the hate race. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.06-1969.33: Well, we continue to widen our selection with expanding merchant phase and competitive prices in the market via strategic margin investments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.35-1974.19: As well as discounts given to our customers for campaigns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.71-1982.92: Accordingly, we invested in certain non-electronic categories, such as supermarkets, to drive our order frequency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1982.94-1988.43: And also invested in electronic categories to fortify our market position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.73-1996.22: Please note that we are very strong in electronics and in electronics the biggest opportunity comes from offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.58-2005.79: On the competitive environment, let me hand over to Murat. Thank you, Korhan. Let me just quickly address competition and let me take next question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2006.37-2013.77: I mean, let me remind you that we operate in this attractive market that has a large, young, organized, and tax-savvy population. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2014.23-2020.54: We have been operating in this market along with several players for many years and proven our growth trajectory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.04-2028.53: So the Turkish market is at a deflection point with a growing e-commerce penetration expected to exceed 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2028.55-2031.11: Within total retail by 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.75-2040.94: That said, roughly 90% of total retail is still offline. Hence, our largest opportunity is offline retail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.70-2046.85: And we would like to capitalize on this opportunity and create long-term values. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2046.87-2056.96: By expanding our customer base, order frequency, merchant base, our selection, and maintaining our price competitiveness and scaling our new strategic assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2057.88-2061.10: And of course, a solid operational execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2061.60-2069.07: Capital efficiency, robust logistics network, deep technology capabilities, piles of branding,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2069.09-2074.87: Harvard Business Model and Integrated Ecosystems value positions us for success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2076.78-2080.90: Third question, if I'm not mistaken, is about Hep C test. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2082.78-2084.38: That's the pain, it's correct. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.33-2089.93: That's great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2090.01-2099.48: EFI Pay is designed to be a companion wallet to spend, save and mobilize money in a flexible way across online and offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.28-2115.46: Having acquired its license in 2016, HaptiPay marks this important milestone by launching this cüzdanım, HaptiPay wallet, as an embedded digital wallet on our platform on the 10th of June. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2116.26-2123.86: As we mentioned, the daily penetration among eligible audience has been faster than our expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2124.32-2127.15: But yet it's too early to disclose numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2127.97-2132.85: But HFPAE Wallet enables instant returns, cancellations and cashbacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.49-2145.49: Along with HFTPay Wallet, HFTPay also introduced HAPEL program, a cashback points program that allows customers to earn redeem points during purchases with their wallet on our platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2146.35-2155.12: Hestify will enable peer-to-peer money transfers and will constantly explore new use case scenarios across online and offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.72-2163.00: Actually in line with our super value proposition, we'll continue to invest and scale our strategic assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.02-2166.15: To the benefit of our customers, including HaptiPay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2166.21-2169.37: Which is well positioned for strong long-term growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2172.85-2173.85: Great, thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2175.03-2183.50: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.05-2190.63: Hi, thank you very much for the presentation and congratulations on the first FFS results post your IPO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.05-2192.61: So I've had a couple of questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.39-2201.34: First on the active user base, are you able to share some sort of granularity around the actual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2201.36-2207.89: As it will be important to track. Anything sort of anecdotal would be helpful as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2208.97-2214.99: I know that there were a couple of questions on the take rates, but I couldn't hear clearly. My line was breaking up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2215.54-2219.38: The implied take rate for the second quarter is quite low. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2220.64-2226.07: Is this a pure mix effect or is there any change in the take rates across categories? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2226.09-2235.54: Potentially due to competitive pressures and is that something that will imply lower take rates going forward for the rest of the year and potentially beyond that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2236.24-2240.46: My next question is what are your expectations on profitability for the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.50-2246.91: For the rest of the year? Where do you see most of the pressure coming from? And related to that,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2247.39-2255.54: How is the profitability profile across your new business lines, especially Pepsi Express? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2261.68-2263.54: For the active user base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2264.32-2269.69: Unfortunately, we do not share our active user base on a quarterly basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2269.97-2274.53: But we will share the increase by the end of the year as a year-end figure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2274.91-2281.18: However, our active user base and frequency keeps on increasing. I can give you a disclosure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.82-2287.83: On the margin investment and the take rate effect,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2288.23-2300.32: I can say our gross contribution margin declined by 2.4 percentage points, reaching 8.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2300.78-2304.68: And this is mainly due to dynamics in genetic growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2305.07-2310.27: There is a 2.5 percentage point decline in gross contribution margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2310.59-2313.79: Driven by strategic margin investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2313.83-2320.62: And because of CRM, which is called a temporary margin investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2321.02-2326.09: And those strategic margin investments are done to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2326.11-2339.80: In electronics, to fortify our market position, and in non-electronics, to drive frequency for this, to bring additional GME for our company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2340.24-2348.53: We continue widen our selection with expanding merchant base and competitive prices in the market by our strategic margin investment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.67-2354.53: As well as discounts given to our customers for temporary campaigns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2355.12-2363.46: And accordingly, we invested in certain categories, non-electronic and electronic categories, such as supermarkets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2363.48-2365.71: And some electronic categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2365.77-2368.65: Please note that we are very strong in electronics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2368.77-2373.59: And in electronics, there is a bigger opportunity comes from offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2373.63-2383.18: And in order to capture these offline customers, we have been making on a no-fail basis margin investments to gain additional GIP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2383.86-2388.83: On the third question, expectations about the profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.55-2395.52: The Turkish market is an inflection point and this is the right time for us to prioritize our growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.88-2402.24: That is why we raise capital and we are focused on investing in and delivering long-term value creation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.80-2414.55: As a result, our key principle remains to prioritize growth to create long-term value by attracting more customers, increasing order frequency, and adding more merchants on our platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2416.82-2425.03: And the next question, maybe I can take the next question. It was about the profitability for new businesses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2426.33-2427.33: Let me remind you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2427.89-2432.41: At Heft Express we aim to become a mainstream grocery shopping destination. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2432.93-2434.17: Or have today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.73-2443.66: It is designed to be a companion wallet to spend, save and mobilize money in a flexible way across online and offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.96-2449.97: So with this strategic mindset, we will certainly prioritize growth for our strategic assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.73-2459.20: In line with our Supra value proposition, we will continue to invest in and scale our strategic assets to the benefit of our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2459.50-2468.07: And FCPay and FCExpress are particularly important to us because they are valid positions for strong long-term growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2472.25-2482.14: Basically, from my understanding, these strategic margin investments, the temporary discounts, they could continue as long as you see the growth opportunity from these. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.16-2490.19: Exactly. If you see the growth opportunity, we can continue those campaigns and margin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2490.51-2500.00: The key principle always will remain that we're going to increase our customer base, merchant base, frequency selection, and that is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2503.46-2510.01: And going forward from what I understand, sorry for the follow-up, so you will be tracking, we will be tracking growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.03-2520.00: In GMB obviously, but we will be seeing disclosure from you on the total orders rather than breakdown of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2520.60-2524.99: Things like active user base and the frequency, we will see the total order number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.09-2532.81: That is true. By the year end, we will be sharing our customers' base increase and frequency numbers in detail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2533.07-2537.00: But on a quarterly basis we don't disclose, we only give the overall growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2539.72-2549.69: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2551.59-2556.14: Thank you for the presentation. Majority of my questions were asked, but I have some more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2557.06-2559.54: The first one is about competition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.10-2568.71: How are you planning to respond to accelerated last mile and fulfillment investments by Transurl? I think they are now much bigger than you on the fulfillment side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2569.49-2578.62: And how many merchants have been already on board for thermal services because you have given some sort of statistics during the IPO? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2579.08-2580.94: And I just want to go to the development here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2581.44-2585.93: And what is the share of total orders delivered by HFC share? What is the progress here? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2587.21-2595.30: And you also mentioned about some shared incentives to management, I think, which is not included in your payroll cost in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2596.20-2598.44: Can you please give some details about this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2599.58-2609.51: And finally about your working capital, there was a big release in the second quarter, so how should we think about this developing in the second half from a cash flow perspective? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2615.88-2622.80: Let me take the first question. Maybe let me just first remind you our well-defined use of proceeds plan.
