asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.07-1861.64: And with that condition, there might be a good consideration for opening up of Hong Kong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1862.08-1867.21: And that also connects to our plan for the Chinese New Year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1932.71-1942.14: For first quarter next year, with some local government right now encouraging people not to travel across regions and the Winter Olympics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1942.64-1949.21: In March, should we still expect domestic performance to be dragged by travel restrictions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1949.69-1960.00: And also with a low base in the second half of this year, should we see a more normalized year on year growth in the second half next year for domestic market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1963.24-1969.55: Yeah, so what we have seen for the domestic travel is 4S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.57-1975.70: By saying, as we have seen, people are paying more attention to safety. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1975.86-1985.00: So we encourage our suppliers to make sure they have very good safety measures, such as providing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.03-1989.85: The hand sanitizers masks to our travelers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1990.45-1997.60: The second S is people prefer to travel with much smaller groups rather than big groups. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.82-2006.11: So normally our customized tool is selling very well. Our customers prefer to hire a car and a tool guide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2006.13-2010.63: With family then to take their family around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.69-2015.30: The third app is with a much shorter talking window. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.98-2023.66: Because of the virus control, a lot of times we will get notifications from different destinations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2024.42-2027.37: So the booking window we have seen is much shorter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2027.73-2032.25: And the last one of the four S is short distance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2032.59-2039.14: So what we have seen is people prefer to travel nearby their hometown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.16-2047.03: Anywhere within the 300 kilo becomes the radiance. People feel more comfortable to travel to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.87-2054.09: And also we have seen young generation prefer to travel much more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2054.27-2064.06: So we have seen the young spenders who were born in 90s and Generation Z trouble quite a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2064.30-2066.59: So these are the trends we have seen so far. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.85-2076.80: Again, I think a lot of it will be depending on how well the virus is being controlled during the first quarter and the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2077.08-2079.82: However, these demands are not disappearing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2080.00-2086.35: From our data of the search, customers pent-up demand is accumulating and very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2087.03-2095.50: Just as what we saw in May holiday this year, the surge of the demand is very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2095.74-2102.24: So, we're very hopeful that the vaccination rates will be continuously increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2102.26-2111.01: The measures of the virus control will prove to be effective and then gradually the market will increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2111.25-2119.30: So your assessment, the second half of 2022 will be stronger than the first half. We very much hope so.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2245.15-2250.51: Which probably is the best, among one of the best in the travel industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2251.95-2259.86: Secondly, on the cost side, our total adjusted costs and operating expenses actually decreased. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2259.88-2268.87: By more than 35% in Q3 compared with the before COVID level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2269.51-2277.50: Thanks to our very largely flexible cost and expensive structure, and as well as efficient operating management.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2330.45-2339.80: But we need to add some investment just to capture the pent-up demand that has already been seen.
