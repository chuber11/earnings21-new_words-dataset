asr:0: OUTPUT 271.95-279.94: Encouraging sales of our growing footwear category of motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes contributing to exceed our expectations.

asr:0: OUTPUT 532.71-538.48: Beyond investment in molds and tooling to facilitate further expansion and refinement of our product categories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.76-549.75: We believe that our performance for the third quarter demonstrates once again our ability to grow revenue, remain operationally efficient and generate significant shareholder value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.55-559.86: To summarise, global consumer spending, particularly on outdoor products like ours, continues to grow as people participate in outdoor activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.88-563.04: That provide some escape from the restrictions of the COVID pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 564.88-566.79: This is a train that we expect to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 568.13-575.20: Global demand for exceptional head to toe protective gear for off-road, motorcycle and MTB riders continues to surge around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 575.94-581.94: We see this through significant restocking orders that we are managing with our supply chain and distribution partners worldwide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 583.50-593.17: This sustained consumer demand, along with recognition from the media, our business partners and industry athletes, continues to energize our entire team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 594.37-603.20: While we still have a lot of work to do in order to differentiate our products, leverage our brand, and manage our supply chain, we remain committed to excellence in all that we do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 603.86-607.03: Our team is focused on increasing our market share.

asr:0: OUTPUT 637.70-642.64: As always, we'd like to thank our entire Deere family, our dedicated employees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.66-647.89: Business partners and team riders for their continued efforts and relentless support. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 648.91-658.16: And with that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions. Operator? Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 658.68-662.56: If you'd like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 663.34-670.05: A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 670.63-678.40: For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we follow up with questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.18-686.35: Our first question comes from Chris Jaros with Dunlap Equity. Please proceed with your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 687.21-692.47: Hey, Sean. Congratulations on an exceptional career. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 692.49-694.47: Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 695.50-704.14: So, I'm going to go ahead and open it up to questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 704.26-707.65: What are you guys doing as a relatively small company in that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.07-713.09: How have you been able to manage the supply chain, given that you've been manufacturing in China? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 713.49-716.42: What have you guys done that's allowed you to execute so well? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.90-720.22: So I think we've... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 720.24-730.19: There's really two big drives that we've focused on. The first is just nurturing the relationships that we've had with some of our manufacturers that we've been with for a very long time now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 731.01-737.84: And also with the tremendous growth that we've seen, we've really become a very important source of business for these manufacturers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 738.50-743.68: Which has placed us in a favourable position in terms of manufacturing space. So that's the one side of it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 744.04-749.57: In terms of just the actual deliveries, getting stock onto the water. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.11-755.58: I think LIAC has always been very well positioned for the kind of situation that we now see with COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 756.34-766.23: We've got a solid supply chain set up actually in Asia. And with the limited travel that one can do now into Asia, that has really benefited us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 766.79-774.19: We drive a lot of our supply chain globally, directly inside Asia with people there that are focused on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 774.21-780.18: Getting our inventory from the manufacturer to all of our customers around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 780.20-783.64: Has been a great strength for us in these difficult times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 785.21-792.55: Okay, so these aren't just regular brokers that anybody is using and are, you know, these are people specific to Liat? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 794.73-800.58: These people are focusing only on 24 hours a day. Okay, that's great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 800.94-805.29: Second question is a higher level question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 805.33-812.85: And I think that's a really good point. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.91-818.10: They've got two years of capacity sold through the channel already. They're just waiting to fulfill over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.92-828.75: And so that market has grown dramatically. And as I think about that market, I think about the different types of people that would use that, that allow us to enter the market, kids, older people, people that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 828.77-833.37: Historically aren't your 25-year-old biker bombing down the mountain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 834.85-840.24: So if that is correct in expanding to that market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.66-846.77: I would think that those people are more interested in your types of products, innovative safety-first kinds of products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 847.19-852.93: What have you seen and is that correct? And what are e-bikes doing to the general MTB market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 855.68-860.12: Absolutely, I mean there's obviously different segments in the e-mountain biking marketplace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 860.96-865.61: Sorry, in the e-bike marketplace, e-mountain biking is a very, very strong segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 866.35-870.63: And that has definitely benefited us in terms of consumer demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.19-879.12: Because we do sell products that are protected. We've got a lot of new entrants that are only able really to enter the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 879.96-887.89: Of the fact that these are electrified bicycles, so they get to really experience some things that they never would have experienced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 887.91-891.85: If it was not an e-bike, if it was a general bicycle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 892.61-902.56: That has really benefited us because these are the kinds of people, either the gears being bought by parents for youngsters that are getting onto these bikes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 903.22-915.84: Or the less capable, maybe slightly older people that have now gained access to cycling as a sport and can get to some great places and potentially some really dangerous places actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.82-921.78: But they are obviously very concerned about getting back to work on Monday. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.62-925.89: For those people, the Liat-Lana protection. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 925.93-940.40: And particularly the body armor, the surge that we've seen, body armor demand. I believe that the e-mountain biking market has been one of the drivers around that surge of demand that we see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 941.44-949.55: And we do have some products that we have now started labeling as very specific to e-mountain biking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 949.59-954.89: The vast majority of our body armour is absolutely perfect for an e-mountain bike rider. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 955.52-965.02: Which is great news because we actually have the products ready on site to sell to these people. So that has certainly benefited us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.61-971.17: Okay, fantastic. So thank you and best of luck in the Q4 season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.43-974.63: Thanks very much, Chris. Catch you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.80-987.71: Our next question is from Christopher Muller with a private investor. Please proceed with your question. Yes, hi Sean. Congrats to you and the team on the continued success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 989.87-991.41: Thanks very much, Chris. Marcia, from you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.19-994.96: I have maybe three questions for you today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 995.58-1005.21: First of all, just to follow up on the supply chain, besides the container delays to the U.S., are you seeing any challenges there, whether it be factory shutdowns or material shortages or something? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1005.35-1010.27: That would impact your product availability or growth plan over the next few quarters? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1013.23-1016.88: I haven't seen anything major in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1017.36-1019.94: Shortages. Some of the factories that we work with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1020.00-1027.49: Both have had temporary electrical shutdowns, but those are short-term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.41-1037.08: So most of the kind of slowdown in manufacturing has been very short term in nature and I don't see us affecting our. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1037.10-1040.90: Ability to supply over the next several quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1042.68-1043.74: That's great to hear. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1044.78-1053.51: And Leslie spoke, you were just about to begin shipping out of Reno. How is that progressing? Is that all scaled up now in Q4? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.04-1063.52: So it's great news. We are shipping only out of Reno now, not shipping anything out of Santa Clarita anymore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1064.08-1072.93: Renote is now fully operational. We've been able to get some really good warehouse-specific, specialized warehouse staff in Renote. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1073.71-1080.56: And we really are seeing and experiencing a great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.58-1084.86: Increase in our ability to fulfill orders quickly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.17-1091.67: We're out as I say fully operational and going really guns and blazing out of there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1091.73-1095.62: That's great news. Yeah, great news indeed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1097.32-1101.46: Any significant changes in distributors or e-commerce retailers this year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1102.50-1107.39: Are you still finding expanded reach, particularly in the more mainstream? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1107.43-1109.51: Trail riding market on the mountain bike side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1111.97-1115.16: I think that's been something which has also been a key driver of our growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.98-1124.86: Over the last several quarters, it's just our relationships that we built with some of our e-commerce dealers that we now are dealing with directly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.71-1133.53: We really have been able to reach a much wider audience, not only limited by where the distributor has a strength. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1134.25-1137.62: We actually are a lot closer to the end consumer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1138.78-1144.46: And I think that's part of the reason why we've seen some great demand for our products, just getting that landscape closer to the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1144.92-1149.23: In consumer, but for selling obviously through our dealer partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1154.15-1158.80: Notice the moto and the bike neck braces were consolidated into a single line this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1160.12-1168.95: Besides the obvious benefits, maybe a reduced inventory and a greater selection of colors for both markets. Were there any other considerations or factors around that change? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1171.45-1174.91: Could you repeat that? I didn't fully understand that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.64-1179.92: Yes, the moto and the bike neck brace lines look like they were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1179.94-1188.87: Consolidated into a single line this year. We no longer have designations on the two different products. And I was just wondering what factors went into that change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1189.09-1191.23: And what are your expectations from that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1193.89-1197.10: I think there's a couple of things that obviously came into that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.98-1204.06: I mean, I think the biggest reason is just that there's very little differentiation actually between those two product lines and the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.22-1208.37: We wanted to be authentic in terms of our product offering, so that's the one angle. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1209.01-1217.94: And then the other side of it is just in terms of the manufacturing efficiency perspective. We didn't feel that having separate lines was going to change anything in terms of consumer demand. It certainly hasn't. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1218.50-1222.74: Also, it obviously makes it a lot more effective from a manufacturing perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1223.94-1232.27: So with the mine increasing, we took the opportunity to consolidate things just a little bit. I think that's going to work out quite well for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1236.78-1242.22: I had for you. Also just wanted to give a shout-out to your design team on a very impressive 2022 line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.32-1244.82: Thanks again, Sean. I'm Sean Thompson. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1246.95-1248.15: Thanks Chris, chat soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1252.39-1258.48: Our next question comes from Olivia Colombo, a private investor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1267.31-1270.51: Hi, Olivier. Yes, I can hear you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1271.91-1276.12: That's perfect. Thank you, Machia. Congratulations on this incredible Q3 report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1276.50-1283.54: What is also remarkable is this quoture alone is 10% higher than your full sales in 2017. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1284.04-1286.09: So I think this is quite an achievement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.55-1293.63: I have three questions about the same thing. My pleasure. You know I like statistics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.44-1302.96: My first question is, like most of the outdoors brands that I've reported so far,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1303.44-1308.69: Most of them have mentioned the slippage of some of their Q3 products into the next quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.65-1316.78: I guess this is the same for you. Is it possible for you to potentially quantify it eventually percentage-wise? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1317.48-1318.92: Is a 10%, 15%, 20%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.00-1328.53: I think what I would say is that we probably lost a good 20% of sales in the US because of the lag. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1329.41-1338.66: And probably about 10% of sales, I wouldn't say lost, I mean we didn't lose them, we still didn't deliver the inventory because it's all on backorder. Probably about 10% on the international side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1339.14-1341.74: That we're going to see falling now into Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.36-1352.09: We've already started shipping a lot of that out of the US warehouse because that stock has now all arrived and is now moving through the network. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1353.15-1357.28: So about 20% in the US and about 10% international. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1360.00-1366.85: Thank you very much. The next question is regarding the professional fees which were up 182% during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1366.87-1370.77: Due to increase in product liability litigation settlement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.41-1377.30: I guess this is probably a one-time event and that should not repeat in the coming quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1379.98-1383.40: Yes, that is correct. So that was a statement of one of our trials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1384.22-1390.41: We should not see that, we certainly don't know of any other areas we can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1390.45-1395.28: Where we are litigating now, where we can expect any settlement like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1396.16-1402.82: So in Q4 I definitely do not expect to see anything like that and hopefully there are no further trials or trials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1404.72-1405.95: That's perfect, yeah, we all hope so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1407.59-1415.03: My final question would be on your new sustainability line that you are launching in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1415.84-1422.54: I would just like to know how long have you been working on this line and what has been the market reception? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.56-1427.31: To something that I think is incredibly innovative and looks very cool. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.77-1437.32: Thank you, Olivier. We've been working on it for about three years now, just planning how we're going to release it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.68-1441.68: At the moment it is a few products that are in the line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.02-1446.01: And over time we obviously hope to grow that line of products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.15-1448.53: And just become. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1448.57-1450.05: A more sustainable economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.07-1459.26: Is something that we do take very seriously at LIAT. We realize that we've all got a responsibility towards sustainability and becoming more eco-friendly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.58-1466.97: So step by step we are working on increasing that. It's taken about three years to get to where we are, but of course now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1467.47-1474.09: We do have the technology, we have the capabilities, we have the suppliers to be able to expand this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1474.63-1477.36: We are planning on expanding it quite quickly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.92-1485.41: We also now have full eco-packaging, so all the packaging that is in around the world now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.83-1494.17: Is fully eco-friendly using things like soya ink and products that are not harmful to the environment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1494.41-1496.80: That is the year we've been working on this, it's about two years now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1497.38-1507.03: That's been a huge change for us. Of course, a lot has to be done in order to put that in place, but we are relieved that we are now in a position where we can say that all of our packaging is eco-friendly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1508.63-1515.66: Do you think this eco-packaging is a higher cost for you or does it lower your costs on the packaging in general? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1518.40-1523.58: We're talking packaging, packaging in general. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1524.24-1527.27: So it's pretty much break even. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1527.41-1534.33: There might be a slight, in some areas, there might be a slight increase in cost, but generally when you go down the eco road,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1534.51-1540.56: You do see some cost increases but then things become, there's less colours. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.58-1545.27: There's less, you limit the detection of materials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.29-1548.07: Which decrease your costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1548.15-1553.71: So it's pretty much break even, maybe slightly higher in some areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.47-1559.54: Because if you're talking about... Yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1561.52-1566.65: I was going to say that if you're talking about on the product side with the sustainable materials that we are using on the product side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1566.97-1568.87: Those are a bit more expensive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.17-1577.54: Some consumers are willing to pay a bit of a premium knowing that they're using materials that are cutting edge like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.02-1587.77: Okay, so thank you very much for taking my questions today and congratulations once more on the great work and looking forward for the rest of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1592.71-1602.40: We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Sean McDonald for closing comments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1605.57-1612.51: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you about our 2021 year-over-year performance in the spring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1615.14-1619.84: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. 
asr:0: END
