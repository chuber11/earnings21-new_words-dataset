asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 3.88-11.05: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Teller2 fourth quarter interim report 2021 conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 11.45-17.94: At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be the question and answer session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 18.38-22.92: To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star and one on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 23.34-29.89: Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance over the phone, please press star zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 30.31-35.28: I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Shell Johnson, CEO. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 36.82-44.88: Yes, thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for bearing with us. We seem to have a little bit of technical issues with the operator system. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 45.37-52.33: But here we are. So welcome to the Tele2 report call for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 53.35-56.48: Today I'm very happy that in front of me I have Charlotte Hanson. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 56.58-66.53: Our new group CFO sitting here in Kista. And of course, with me here, Henri Tegroth, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Stefan Trampus, our Head of B2B. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 68.03-71.09: So today, we will walk you through the results of the quarter and the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 71.73-79.04: The progress that we made in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 and beyond. And we'll do a Q&A at the end of it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 80.46-89.39: 2021 was yet another year with impressive results for the group, and I would like to start by highlighting the achievements and strategic initiatives that we've taken. So moving to slide two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 91.53-95.56: So despite the challenging year with headwinds stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 95.84-105.05: We were able to lift and deliver on our guidance for 2021 by growing end-user service revenue by 1% and underlying EBITDA by 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 105.73-115.38: This was done by continued strong performance in the Baltics, as we were able to achieve both ospo and volume growth while maneuvering through an unpredictable pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 116.82-122.80: In Sweden B2B, we were able to reach stabilization in Q3 and we see yet another strong quarter today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 123.76-133.57: In Sweden Consumer, we continued our more for more strategy and saw strong performance within mobile postpaid and fixed broadband while we were able to mitigate the decline in digital TV. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 134.77-143.32: At the same time, we executed on our business transformation program, which ended the year with an annual run rate of 500 million SEC in line with our target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.92-153.73: During the year, we took a major step in our FMC strategy by creating the new premium Tele2 brand through the consolidation of two of the most iconic brands in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 154.27-158.04: And with that, we concluded the first phase of our FMC strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 159.82-165.13: I'm very happy to see the results in Sweden B2B that Stefan and his team has delivered during the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 166.01-169.23: When we presented a new B2B strategy on Capital Markets Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 169.31-177.88: I was optimistic and excited, but it pleases me to now say that they have over-delivered on my expectations for the second half of the year in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 179.08-193.07: This improvement is not merely done through our new SME mobile portfolio, but we see improvement across all segments as we are now able to show the second consecutive quarter of growth for a business that was declining by high single digits a year ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 195.08-202.22: In September, we announced the sale of our stake in T-Mobile Netherlands, which was the last step in consolidating our international footprint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 202.96-212.31: I'm very impressed by the results the team has shown there during the last years and the value that they have created. And we were able to achieve a very good valuation for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 213.53-220.58: We expect the transaction to be completed soon and once it is done, we intend to distribute all of the proceeds to our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 222.30-230.69: Tele2 is a strong cash generative company and as I said during the Capital Markets Day, one of our mid-term targets is to have the best industry shareholder return. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 231.99-236.66: With the equity-free cash flow that we have generated this year, or rather last year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 237.36-245.41: The board intends to increase the ordinary dividend by 12.5% to 6.75 kronor per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 245.95-253.27: This puts us comfortably within our leverage range and as we generate more cash and grow our underlying EBITDA throughout the year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 253.79-261.06: You should expect us to re-level the balance sheet to remain around the midpoint over time and distribute that cash to our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 261.96-263.90: With that, please move to slide three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 266.39-273.63: We started 2021 by witnessing negative impacts on the pandemic with the primary headline being lower international roaming revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 274.61-283.66: However, during the year, we've seen roaming gradually returning, and we are now experiencing a tailwind, albeit at a lower level than before the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 285.13-292.09: At the same time, we've been able to build a solid foundation for growth throughout the year, which we have seen tangible results for since Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 294.39-302.18: In this quarter, we see a continuation of this and we were able to grow end-user service revenue by 2%, both including and excluding roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 303.06-306.67: Adding up to a 1% growth for the whole of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 309.01-313.39: In Q4, we decided to take our foot off the gas a bit in terms of commercial spending. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 314.31-323.58: Since I became CEO of this company, you have heard me talk about the importance of balancing value and volume in the consumer business in order to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.56-332.41: During the first half of 2021, we focus on monetizing the increased demand for data by our customers by executing on our more for more strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 333.31-340.42: In the second half, as societies opened and market activity picked up, we shifted focus to invest more in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 341.26-349.61: As Q4 normally is a quarter driven by high activity through campaigns, we decided to take a more active part in the market compared to the year before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 350.81-358.68: This hampers some of the underlying EBITDA growth in the quarter but creates value for the long term as we balance the value and volume in our customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 360.00-369.71: This, coupled with FX headwinds in Sweden and increased inflation, particularly in the Baltics, resulted in an underlying EBITDA growth of 1.3% in a quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 370.75-379.40: Since this was in line with our plans and clearly communicated, we are able to land spot on with our guidance for the year as underlying EBITDA grew by 5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 380.92-390.29: As a result, we saw strong cash generation during 2021, with equity-free cash flow growing double digits to 5.8 billion for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 391.97-401.54: In Sweden consumer we see continued strong performance in broadband and mobile postpaid. And mobile postpaid end user service revenue on the back of our more for more strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 402.82-409.71: With investments in the market, we were able to see strong net intake in mobile phosphate, resulting in a customer base growing year over year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 410.55-418.16: The renamed Tela2 Play Plus continues to show solid performance, and we also launched our first SLYN offer now in January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 418.58-424.08: Further future-proofing our role as a player both in linear and OTT universe within the TV business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 426.01-433.31: Sweden B2B saw the second consecutive quarter of growth driven by mobile volume growth solutions and slight tailwind in Romwex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 434.41-443.64: The mobile volume growth is driven by all segments. Activity within the solution space continues to pick up despite some challenges in the supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 445.49-453.37: The Baltics continue to perform well, driven by both volume and aftergrowth in Lithuania and Latvia, resulting in strong end-user service revenue development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 454.41-463.94: During the quarter we saw some elevated costs driven by increased commercial spending in order to sustain the growth but also through higher inflation rates, primarily impacting energy costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 465.35-473.03: On a positive note, in Latvia we were able to secure Spectrum in the 700 MHz auction and at fair prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 473.05-476.98: Which now enables us to start a full rollout of 5G within the country. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 478.48-481.36: So let's move over to Sweden Consumer, slide five. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 484.24-491.29: During the quarter, we saw strong mobile postpaid net intake. And as a result, we were able to grow the customer base compared to last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 492.13-498.76: Post-play loss to increase by 2% driven by price adjustments made previously in the year and slight tailwind from roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 500.04-505.61: Price adjustments made earlier in the year continued to impact the fixed broadband AFPU, which grew by 1%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 506.65-510.07: We saw a strong quarter in terms of new sales within fixed or broadband. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 511.05-521.48: However, this was offset by higher churn in the base as an effect of historically high sales periods in which customers are now rolling off, resulting in somewhat lower net intake. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 523.22-530.71: In digital TV, cable and fiber, we see continued contribution from Tele2Play+, which helped us to grow by 3% in a quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 531.25-535.88: We continue to see a negative intake, which hampers end-user service revenue growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 537.36-541.38: Moving on, on slide six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 542.22-550.23: As to in volume growth, mobile postpaid led to an end-user service revenue growth of 2% for mobile postpaid and 1% for total mobile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 551.57-557.58: We see continued end-user service revenue growth in fixed broadband of 3%, driven by both ASPU and volume growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.30-567.27: Total end-user service revenue for digital TV declined by 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by continued decline in the legacy DTT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 567.29-570.19: TV service due to a declining customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 571.31-573.65: And moving on to B2B, next page. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 575.28-581.28: Mobile net intake continued to be strong in the quarter, driven by new contracts both within SME and large segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 582.22-588.49: The mobile offer declined in the quarter by 4%, but we clearly see improvements from the levels witnessed at the end of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 590.11-603.12: Continued mobile volume growth and strong growth in the solutions business was able to fully offset the decline in the legacy fixed business resulting in Sweden B2B growing end-user service revenue for the second consecutive quarter with 1%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 604.44-607.73: Now let's turn to page 8 for a sweet overview. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.53-618.28: End-user service revenue was flat in Sweden as growth in Sweden B2B was offset by continued decline in the legacy services within Sweden consumer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 619.28-622.04: Underlying EBITDA was flat compared to Q4 2016. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.08-631.27: As a contribution from the business transformation program was offset by FX headwinds and increased commercial spending in a quarter within Sweden consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.59-642.14: We continue to see strong cash conversion of 64% but at slightly lower levels compared to previous quarters as we ramp up networks investments related to the 5G rollout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 643.56-645.49: Then moving to Baltics, page 10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 647.05-656.46: In the Baltics, we continue to see strong volume and astro growth in Lithuania and Latvia, as we are able to monetize data through our More for More strategy. And a slight tailwind from Romania. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 657.42-666.91: In Estonia we also see strong ASPIR growth driven by price adjustments, while volume growth was hampered by promotional activity from competitors leading to elevated churn in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 668.59-677.48: Moving on, natural disease asked to end volume growth resulted in strong end-user service revenue in the quarter and we saw growth of 14% for the Baltics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 678.20-687.21: Underlying EBITDA grew by 7% in a quarter as the strong end-user service revenue growth was partly offset by slight pressure from rising inflation rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 687.23-692.27: Primarily impacting energy costs and higher commercial spend in Lithuania and Estonia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 692.71-699.86: And I would add also an adjustment in our, an accounting adjustment related to handsets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 700.98-707.67: But with that, I'd like to hand over to Charlotte, who will take us through the financial overview. So welcome, Charlotte, and I hand it over to you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.45-716.28: Thank you, Shell, and good morning, everyone. Before we dig into the group financials, I'd like to give a quick take on my first impressions of Teletype. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 717.38-725.63: During my first week here, I can see that in the last couple of years, Territur has built a solid foundation to become a leading telco in the Nordic and the Baltic regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 726.39-735.02: This includes investing and developing an organization that can create sustainable growth, best industry shareholder return, and lead in sustainability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 736.28-743.98: The group leadership team that I've joined includes several individuals with a long expertise of the telco industry, both domestic and international. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 745.17-758.74: And after working in several different companies outside of the telco industry, I believe I can contribute with an outside perspective in order to improve and excel the already fantastic results that we have seen, which we will continue to achieve going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 760.00-765.91: It's our job now to show that we can deliver on our midterm ambitions and illustrate that we are a growing company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.65-770.05: Please turn to page 13 in the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 773.85-779.88: As in previous quarters, we have created this slide to show the revenue breakdown of our segments, excluding roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 780.00-784.70: To illustrate that we are a company that is going to fight the tailwind from roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 785.73-792.21: Like Shel said, consumer postpaid continues to perform well as price adjustments made previously during the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 792.23-795.82: And volume growth contributes to the end-user service revenue growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 797.18-802.84: Total Sweden consumer end-user service revenue declined by 0.6% in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 802.88-809.17: Excluding roaming, as growth in mobile postage and fixed broadband was offset by decline in legacy services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 811.01-818.18: In Sweden B2B, we see continuous strong momentum in mobile and solutions offset by decline in fixed legacy services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.34-821.08: And total end-user service revenue remains stable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 821.10-822.72: Despite roaming being excluded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 824.40-832.73: In the Baltics, the strong performance continues, resulting in 13% growth, primarily driven by higher ASBU and volume growth in Lithuania and Latvia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 834.07-839.96: For the group, this led to an end-user service revenue growth of 2.3% in the quarter, excluding roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.98-851.07: We now see that roaming revenue is starting to come back in a material way as outbound roaming increased by 25 million SEC in the quarter compared to Q4 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 852.01-856.18: However, this is still not close to the roaming levels that we saw prior to the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.10-860.18: Please turn to slide 14 for the group results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 865.17-873.75: Underlying EBITDA grew by 1% organically in the quarter, driven by end-user service revenue growth and contribution from the Business Transformation Program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 874.67-883.80: However, this was partly offset by higher commercial spending, primarily in Sweden, but also in Lithuania and Estonia. And FX had wins in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.02-889.91: We also see high inflation rates impacting the costs, primarily through higher energy costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 891.95-896.52: Items affecting comparability of minus 117 million in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 896.54-906.07: Primarily stemming from restructuring costs taken in the quarter which relates to the continued execution of the business transformation program in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 908.05-912.69: The decrease in net profit for continuing operations compared to Q4 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 912.71-922.66: Was primarily driven by the close down of the operation in Luxembourg, which had a positive impact on the results by roughly 3.3 billion seconds Q4 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.88-924.64: But with no impact on equity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 926.11-934.15: There's also higher amortization of the brand compared to last year following the brand merger in Q2 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 936.02-938.54: So let's continue with the cash flow on slide 15. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.88-948.43: CapEx pay decreased to $971 million in the second quarter, driven by higher network investments related to 5G in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 949.61-954.71: Working capital was strong in the quarter as we saw three separate items that had a positive impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 955.01-960.42: Firstly, we settled the receivable in the quarter of roughly 325 million SEK. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 961.12-969.15: Secondly, the timing of an account payable was favourable in the quarter, but we expect to see the opposite effect in Q1 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 970.41-974.79: Thirdly, we see continued contribution from external hands of financing in the Vortex. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 976.82-985.93: Taxes paid declined compared to Q4 2020, primarily driven by preliminary tax in Sweden for the year 2020, which was repaid in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 987.61-995.12: All of this led to a quarter with remarkably strong cash generation of 1.8 billion SEK in equity-free cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 996.20-1004.36: For 2021, our continuing operations have thus generated 5.8 billion SEC or 8.3 SEC per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1006.41-1009.83: Please move to slide 16 to go through the capital structure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1013.09-1021.88: Economic net debt rose by 0.2 billion SEC in the quarter as we paid out the second tranche of the ordinary dividend of 2.1 billion SEC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1022.68-1027.43: However, this was largely offset by the strong cash generation in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.71-1034.97: At the end of the year, leverage was 2.5, which is still in the lower end of the target range of 2.5 and 3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1036.52-1042.02: With a proposed 2.5% increase in ordinary dividend for the financial year of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1042.12-1050.51: We will comfortably be within our range and we remain committed to maintaining leverage around the midpoint of 2.5 and 3 over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1051.37-1058.08: And relever the balance sheet as the underlying EBITDA in order to distribute excess cash to our shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1060.30-1066.61: In addition to the ordinary dividend, we also intend to distribute the full proceeds from T-Mobile Net Balance transactions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1066.99-1070.41: As soon as the transaction is closed and we have received the cash proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1072.17-1081.36: With that, I will hand over to Kjell. Thank you very much, Charlotte. And then please turn over to slide 17, where we'll go through the business transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1082.28-1091.65: So far, we have reached an annualized run rate of 500 million, with savings of 115 million affecting the P&L in a quarter and 355 million for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1092.19-1094.85: We are now entering the last stages of the transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1095.82-1099.90: These last stages include three major operational improvements within the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1100.58-1102.62: Decommissioning the 3G network,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1102.64-1111.95: Improve efficiency within our consolidated IT and technology organization, and decommissioning our remaining IT stacks once we have migrated all customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1113.11-1120.76: Firstly, the close down of SUNAP, which we have already started, will increase the efficiency within our mobile network and reduce the amount of sites. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1120.78-1126.35: That we have as we consolidate towers and move frequencies into one company, Net4Mobility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1127.57-1136.26: Secondly, when Tele2 and Comham merged, we realized certain synergies within the technology department by merging the fixed and mobile network organizations into one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1137.34-1143.20: When Jogesh joined the company, we further consolidated the technology and the IT department into one organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1143.22-1148.59: In order to improve collaboration within that organization, but also with the commercial units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1149.23-1151.83: From this, we expect to realise further synergies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.81-1166.65: And thirdly, we have so far already decommissioned two of our IT systems and in 2022, we'll carry out the major IT migration elements, which will yield the largest cost savings and vastly improve operational efficiency. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1167.75-1176.20: When we consolidated the Tele2 and ComHem brand, we created a new IT stack on which new FMC customers are put. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1177.42-1184.38: Now the job is to migrate existing customers onto that IT stack as we currently operate the different brands on different IT stacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1185.17-1190.43: With all customers on one IT stack, we will vastly reduce the internal complexity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1190.49-1196.90: Simplify the product portfolio and reduce the time the customer spends with customer service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.80-1203.78: This is of course not an easy job. We have already started migrating our first customers with successful results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.84-1214.41: However, in order to secure quality in all these complex projects and enable stable commercial momentum, we will extend the deadline from end of 2022 to end of Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.42-1221.40: This is purely a matter of timing in order to optimize our ways to deliver on our midterm ambitions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1221.96-1228.75: We're still confident that we will achieve the target of at least 1 billion SEC in annualized run rate savings by the end of the period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1229.17-1236.48: At the same time, we are able to guide on mid-single-digit growth in underlying EBITDA, despite less contribution in 2010. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1236.60-1243.46: From cost savings, which I will talk about on the next slide, demonstrating the long-term growth journey that we have embarked upon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.92-1250.23: This is about saving costs, but it's also about building sustainable growth, and we need to balance those two things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1251.23-1252.85: So moving to slide 18. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1254.17-1258.80: I'm happy to announce that we can now guide for the full year in accordance with our mid-term guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.42-1268.23: We expect low single-digit growth in end-user service revenue and mid-single-digit growth in underlying EBITDA for 2022 compared to 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1269.23-1275.68: We expect CAPEX, excluding spectrum and leases, to be in the higher end of our range of 2.8 to 3.3 billion SEK. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1275.70-1281.82: Driven by investment primarily in our mobile network as we ramp up the 5G rollout in Sweden and the Baltics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1281.84-1285.59: But also investment in the fixed network through remote PHY. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1287.37-1299.68: For end-user service, we expect to continue the momentum that we had since Q2 2021 by making all countries contribute to the growth as we leverage the continued performance in the Baltics and return to growth in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1300.46-1305.87: We expect Sweden B2B to continue the positive momentum that we have seen during the second half of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1306.55-1313.21: This does not mean that we will grow Sweden B2B every quarter during the year, but our aim is to stabilize and grow the business for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1314.21-1320.06: In Sweden Consumer, we expect the momentum in mobile postpaid and fixed broadband to persist through our more for more strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.72-1324.78: We also expect to see continued momentum in the Baltics to provide support for the entire group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1327.17-1333.83: The end-user service revenue growth will filter down to underlying EBITDA, and we will continue to execute on the business transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1334.37-1341.88: The program remains back and loaded in the year and we expect to reach the majority of the remaining annual run rate in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1342.86-1347.01: As I pointed out, during the first half of 2021,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1347.03-1353.39: Commercial activity and advertisement was significantly reduced during that part of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1353.45-1357.16: And we have now focused on bringing sustainable growth back in the second half. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1358.06-1359.88: And this leads to some investment in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1360.66-1368.61: This coupled with the phasing of the Business Transformation Program will result in year-on-year underlying EBITDA trends to be more favorable from the summer of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1368.63-1371.73: As we will continue to invest during the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1373.47-1377.42: We'll today also reiterate our midterm guidance, similar to our guidance for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.88-1384.58: In this guidance we aim for sustainable growth for the group with continued contribution for all countries while the business transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1384.60-1390.15: Will continue to give tailwind to underlying Ibidal up until the first half of 2024. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.05-1396.28: For CAPEX, we expect to be in the high end of our guidance during the peak of the 5G rollout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1396.78-1404.50: And will gradually reduce capital spending as we complete the 5G rollout and improve the operational efficiency through the Business Transformation Program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1405.77-1409.77: So then please turn to the next slide for the key priorities going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.73-1420.50: In Sweden, we will continue to ramp up 5G investments in order to increase customer satisfaction, which will support our more for more strategy within the mobile business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.20-1431.23: Similarly, on the fixed side, we see the upgrade with remote fires as an opportunity to increase capacity and speed in order to maintain reliable growth in our broadband business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1432.31-1440.36: We will continue executing on the Business Transformation Program to deliver at least 1 billion SEK of savings by the end of Q2 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1441.74-1452.43: In Sweden Consumer, we will continue to balance value and volume in order to build sustainable growth while gearing up our capabilities to address the 1.3 million non-FMC households. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.69-1463.44: We will also continue to build our premium brand in order to increase customer satisfaction that we can monetize through reduced charge or price adjustments on the back of product improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1465.37-1474.29: At Sweden B2B, we will continue the turnaround that we have started during the second half of the year by executing on our new granular approach with clearly defined segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1475.86-1482.72: In the Baltics, we will continue to build on the performance that we've seen and execute on our mobile-centric convergence strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.74-1486.07: Through more and more offers in order to make sure that we can sustain the growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.43-1494.63: With the 5G auctions now concluded in Latvia, we will start to ramp up the 5G rollout while preparing for the auctions in Lithuania and Estonia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.60-1499.78: At the same time, we will continue to develop and explore FMC capabilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.56-1510.63: Lastly, we aim to close the T-Mobile Netherlands transaction soon, in which we intend to distribute all proceeds to our shareholders once the transaction is closed and we have received the proceeds. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.39-1520.42: Tele2 is a growth company at heart, and we are witnessing positive results from our strategic initiatives, which demonstrates the viability of our way forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.14-1529.71: I am confident in our ability to succeed and deliver on our 2022 and mid-term guidance and excited to continue building sustainable growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1530.63-1535.78: And with that, I'd like to hand it over to the operators so we can do a Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.74-1547.59: Thank you. Dear participants, we will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone keypad and wait for it to be announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1548.59-1555.16: If you wish to cancel your request, please use the hash key. Once again, please press star and one if you wish to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1559.38-1564.04: The first question comes from Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.88-1571.25: Yeah, good morning everyone. I just had a couple of questions focusing on around the cost base of your business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1571.59-1575.38: I guess that's where the greatest investor focus is today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1575.88-1580.86: Just firstly on the cost in the quarter and that you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1580.88-1586.25: Highlight will continue into the first half of 2022 in terms of sales and marketing costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1586.83-1593.25: Is that purely phasing or do you think there's a sign there that the cost to compete has gone up in the market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1594.17-1602.78: And then second question just around your mid-term cost cutting which you have pushed back by six months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1602.94-1605.55: One of your peers KPN did yesterday as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1605.85-1611.23: Just wanted to try and understand, has cost cutting or cost efficiencies become harder? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.25-1620.32: Or has COVID changed the scope of that cost reduction? Try to understand a little bit more why the delay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.34-1624.56: The key reason for the question really there is we're trying to think about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1624.58-1629.05: Whether you can continue to create further efficiencies further out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.07-1636.30: The middle of 2023 and trying to understand how much scope there is for long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1636.32-1639.28: Greater efficiencies in the company. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1640.44-1646.43: Yeah, let me start and then I would invite maybe one or two colleagues there. Let me take the second one first and then midterm cost cutting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1647.39-1655.80: If we were single-mindedly focused on cutting costs, we could have done the transformation program by the end of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.06-1664.50: But what you see is the second half of twenty one were actually able to get back to uh... Meaningful growth uh... In sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1665.03-1674.01: And I really would like for Stefan and Hendrik to not have too many freeze periods where they are limited in their approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1674.41-1679.24: And I'm quite confident that that brings more value, especially in the medium term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1679.26-1685.15: Getting the business back to growth rather than fast forwarding this cost-cutting program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.57-1687.83: To deliver on this, we will definitely do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1688.33-1689.55: There is no doubt about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1689.87-1691.65: But from a value perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1691.75-1697.04: I think the sequencing that we are putting now, where we are taking the loss of the big migrations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1697.06-1702.42: In the first quarter of 2023 is a better one for our overall business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.00-1710.61: And we talk a lot about the sales and marketing costs and of course this is just a sign of a market becoming more normal again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1711.09-1720.00: So we have comparisons where there were very low levels. You saw we had a huge uptick in our EBITDA in the first part of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.40-1725.97: Since we are very, very transparent in the way we go to market and operate with you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1726.63-1735.42: I could have made a bridge to you easily that would take us back to the consensus of 3.7 by pointing out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1735.44-1741.00: Elements related to an IFRS adjustment we've done, the electricity cost in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1741.02-1743.08: In the Baltics and from exchange losses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1743.26-1744.48: We'll be back at... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1744.50-1745.91: What the consensus was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1746.99-1751.23: But this is how we are. We are maybe a little bit too brutally honest with ourselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1752.37-1757.14: So let's not overdo the sales and marketing. I don't know, Henrik, do you want to add a few comments to that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.62-1763.70: Yes, Shell. Pleased to. Hey, Andrew. Hi. Thanks for the question. So on the sales and marketing cost, as Shell was saying,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1763.98-1774.81: We of course need to look at where we are in the fourth quarter against early in the year also from a return to normality point of view and that of course brings you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1774.83-1779.10: In general to a little bit of a normalized level also on your marketing and sales cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1779.12-1784.08: And then within that, the fourth quarter is typically a very high trading season. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1784.10-1788.85: We do a lot of the promotions, a lot of the handsets and device sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1789.59-1798.74: And actually we've performed quite nicely in the quarter, I would say particularly on the mobile postpaid side. And then on your question, how will that translate into next year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1799.14-1807.37: I would say, you know, as long as we get out of, let's say, back to normality and out of COVID, you will see, of course, a, you know, a normalized run rate again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1808.55-1812.31: But within that, the fourth quarter is a higher cost quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1813.29-1823.02: And I also would like to point out that a lot of that commercial cost is driven by acquisition costs and not as much as marketing costs, which I saw in some of the commentaries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1823.82-1830.63: Because we've of course also been able to get some transformation savings onto our marketing spend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.65-1836.36: By moving to one brand. So there's a lot more related cost to volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1839.80-1848.11: Can I just follow up on the longer term, what you're seeing in the company at the moment, does that give you confidence that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1848.13-1854.95: There's further costs or efficiencies to go after post the midterm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.97-1860.64: Plan or do we then rely on operational gearing to drive the growth forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1862.10-1865.13: Yeah, that's also why we are re-threading our mid-term guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.53-1869.07: There are, I think we can say that there are cost savings, there are cash savings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1869.43-1877.98: The Swedish model has also quite a lot of capitalized expenses for consultants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1878.00-1879.82: That feel a bit unique to Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1880.14-1887.63: At the end of the day I do see a scope for improvements beyond the program that we have now defined in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1887.65-1890.29: Reduction of cash spending in the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1898.34-1903.88: Hello? Excuse me, Andrew, have you finished with your questions? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1908.23-1914.51: He might have dropped up, but sorry about that. We're having some problems with the webcast, everyone. Well, let's go to Ulrich. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1915.22-1918.98: I think we can go to the next question operator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.02-1924.74: If the next question comes from the line of Ulrich Rather from Jeffress, please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1926.07-1930.05: Thank you. I have two questions, please. The first one is a bit of a follow-up on the earlier one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1930.87-1938.86: Just to clarify, when you talk about the phasing of commercial events with regard to the BTS sort of change,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.26-1944.46: Is that the customer migrations or is it other commercial events that you're referring to? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1945.57-1957.12: Is this plan informed by anything you see in the market, actions by competitors or competitive levels overall in the market, or is it simply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1957.14-1963.24: Going back to the drawing board, putting together all the plans and sort of deciding this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1963.52-1969.01: This is better to sort of shift it out by six months or is it more internal or external? That's the first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.65-1971.93: And then the second question is,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1971.95-1980.00: You mentioned during your prepared remarks that there was a bit of a wave of contract expiries in the fourth quarter due to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1980.80-1986.35: I suppose high sales in prior fourth quarters and then these contracts have expired and created higher chance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.97-1995.04: How do you see that? Generally, you would hope not to see high churn when contracts expire. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1995.34-2000.16: Was this sort of a normal rate and just a higher underlying contract expiry? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.84-2009.65: Or was there a reason why more people percentage-wise of these expiring contracts decided to leave Tellur2 or ask for? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.67-2011.87: For better terms. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2012.73-2015.94: I will do the first one and Henrik will do the second one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2016.44-2018.92: So you're basically asking me why did we shift to six months? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2019.02-2022.64: I actually see that as a signal of strength in the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2022.72-2030.47: If we were not succeeding in the go-to-market, then we would redouble the efforts of costs to try to compensate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2030.93-2038.98: The thing here is that I see that both Stefan and now Hendrik have the opportunity to build sustainable growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.10-2040.70: And then it's easier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2040.72-2045.21: To let them have a little bit of maneuvering space in the go-to-market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2045.23-2051.61: It's a decision that we have made internally based on how we think we can get the most value out of the approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2051.91-2059.92: So if we see the opportunity like we do now to have sustainable growth, it makes sense to give them a little bit more space and have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2059.94-2062.86: Don't be bogged down by too many freeze periods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2063.22-2065.45: So overall, I think this is good news. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.81-2069.97: Thanks for your questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2070.75-2078.90: So first of all, just to confirm a couple of things. First of all, from a commercial point of view in the consumer market, we're really executing on a value strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2079.26-2088.71: So we're trying to drive value into the market and of course with that also increase the overall value in the market for the industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.63-2099.62: And with that, we're in a regular cycle that is recovering, coming out of COVID with typically the fourth quarter being a very high trading season with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2099.96-2106.57: You know, some additional commercial spend just from the quarter itself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2107.27-2110.11: If we look into, take this forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2111.01-2125.37: Then what you can expect is that we, you know, in 22, will be able, as we recover from COVID, although we still have some weakness in, you know, the end of January and in January as we speak,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2125.91-2128.97: We will be able to get to a better sustainable commercial rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2129.15-2132.99: But not at the level of Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2133.15-2142.94: Not the high level of Q4 because that's a seasonality and not at the low levels we've seen earlier in in 21 but we were very much focused on focused on EBITDA in the midst of COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.32-2146.65: Then in terms of what happens with the customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2146.95-2155.10: We've seen that, and I think your question particularly pertains to broadband and our net intake of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.12-2160.40: Of 1k versus a normal rate of, you know, a mid-single-digit rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2160.94-2168.59: And I think we've sort of been guiding that what happens in this quarter in particular around broadband is, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2168.61-2179.72: That we had a pretty decent sales rate, although we've had some impact from COVID on some of the channels that has sort of given a little bit of softening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2180.52-2185.63: But in particular, we've seen for this quarter that we've had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.65-2191.85: Campaigns that we've had over the last two years, a 24-month campaign and a 12-month campaign,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.87-2202.22: That have both rolled out and ended in this quarter and typically if we roll off a campaign this always comes with a level of churn so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2202.24-2210.49: Because we've had now two sort of these campaigns all happening in this quarter. We've seen some additional take up on Churin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2210.73-2213.39: And that's sort of the key driver for the rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2213.41-2219.64: And that is not a continued trending, that is very much a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2219.66-2225.39: A particular event in the fourth quarter. And I would say underlying our broadband. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.41-2229.79: You know, traction is still around sort of that mid-single-digit rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2230.57-2239.86: And then lastly, what we typically do in terms of migrations, as we execute on more and more pricing strategies, we continuously. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2239.88-2245.49: Move and upgrade customers to of course our new front book and of course also to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2245.51-2252.29: Our new product sets that we have. And if you mean migration in that sense, that's what we continue to do as part of More for More. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.73-2259.80: Very helpful. Can I just clarify the very first question that they asked, these commercial events, which is specifically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2260.00-2267.11: Talk about in the report as sort of the phasing of that and forming the delay to the BTS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2267.49-2273.79: What exactly are these commercial events? Is it the migration waves? Is that what it is or what is it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2274.33-2280.00: Ah yes, okay, so yeah, we probably could be more clear in our language. So it's basically what I'm trying to say is that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2281.08-2282.80: Let me take a historic perspective on this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2282.94-2287.85: My predecessor made a decision which I think was right at the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2287.87-2293.03: To focus on EBITDA and costs because of the uncertainties around COVID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2293.45-2302.84: Now we are at the end of this thing and we have seen that we've been able to get meaningful growth back into all main lines of our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2303.26-2307.71: Then it makes sense for me and the management team to focus on getting that growth going. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.11-2315.90: And the commercial event that I mean is that if for example, Henrik is planning a campaign in an important period of the year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2315.92-2321.04: We don't want him to be too restricted by constant freeze periods. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2321.24-2329.65: So by sequencing the B2P program so that it fits well with our go-to-market, we are able to do both of these things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2329.81-2334.01: And that builds the most value for the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2335.90-2337.54: Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2340.00-2346.39: The next question comes from the line of Andres Jolson from Danske Bank. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.03-2357.28: Great. To you all, a question on leverage. You have been at the lower end of the leverage for quite a few quarters now, as the slide showed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2357.44-2363.42: Is there anything that would change that view? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2363.44-2369.59: What is preventing the board from moving you to the mid of the range that you expressed. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2371.91-2374.71: I can start, you can take over. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.42-2382.18: We have had a very positive 2021 from a cash flow perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.60-2386.47: And a couple of things have come our way that has been really helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2386.77-2393.69: We expected it and it has happened. So you see a very high cash flow generation in the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2394.23-2400.20: And we do remain committed to the policy. We will be reviewing this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2400.50-2405.79: Last year we paid an extraordinary amount in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2406.15-2412.45: Of course, I cannot say anything about what we're going to do this year, but the board is very committed to our policies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.49-2419.58: So if we see that we will be over time trending significantly lower than what we have said,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2419.66-2421.42: Then that will be reviewed for sure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2422.36-2428.39: We have no desire as a management or as a board to hold back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2428.41-2432.73: Any significant amount compared to what you expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2433.03-2439.42: And of course, one thing we are doing now is that we are handing out, when the deal closes in the Netherlands, the entire amount. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2439.88-2449.61: Despite the fact that, you know, from a ratings perspective, some of that revenue would have been calculated by S&P as future contributions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2449.97-2456.64: So that's a signal of strength from our side. But yes, we remain committed to the policy and we will be monitoring that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2459.58-2467.33: Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Nielsen from ABG. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2468.17-2469.97: Thanks very much. Morning, guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.67-2477.74: Just a question related again to the transformation program but the internal side of it. You've spoken about the market side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2478.08-2482.40: On the IT migration transformation, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2482.70-2487.27: Is this running according to plan or are you seeing some... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2487.29-2494.17: Some issues here that sort of moves this also slightly into the next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2494.51-2503.58: That was my first question and just second one, we are seeing a slight weakening of trends in the TV business. Could you give us any indication or... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2503.60-2508.99: No qualitative comments on how do you view the TV business moving into this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2509.37-2514.45: Thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2515.56-2520.64: So on the migrations, we have actually started that process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2521.10-2528.33: So one of our main brands is moving to the new platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2528.55-2533.93: And we haven't had any unexpected things there. Actually, it's been relatively smooth, I would say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2534.29-2540.50: These things are never super easy, but there hasn't been any kind of red or even orange flags coming up there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2541.58-2551.11: So again, our reasoning for the choice we've made is exactly what you see is what you get. This is our thinking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2551.47-2557.20: We really want to make sure that we extract the most value from the market in this process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2558.66-2566.95: We are very confident about the business transformation plan, both the number and of course now the timeline that we have set. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.25-2572.13: And I think it's definitely the right thing to do in terms of a value creation perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2574.35-2576.18: Hey Peter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.54-2584.96: On the TV or an entertainment business, just to give you sort of some insight there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2585.51-2587.29: In last year's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2587.31-2602.04: Capital Markets Day, I think it was very clearly launched and stated that our aim is to stabilize and modernize our entertainment business to also contribute to driving value for the overall consumer business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.28-2607.85: And that's basically still our aim. So our aim is to stabilize this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2608.33-2614.51: And to make the necessary adjustments so that we can really move into. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2614.53-2621.06: Into streaming and get more solid fundamentals in the DTV business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2622.28-2627.45: What you see if you look at the numbers on the line, you see at least the revenue level that are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2627.47-2634.01: You know cable and fiber entertainment businesses is sort of starting to stabilize whilst we still have some. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2634.03-2638.24: You know, decline on the, let's say, the legacy DTT side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2639.02-2640.96: And that is in part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2640.98-2650.03: Coming through from the uptake we're seeing on our streaming business which sits in the cable and fiber numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2651.01-2658.02: Again, we're still early on because since we've now just rebranded Command Play Plus into Tele2 Play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.70-2666.03: We're seeing some good growth momentum and that's also where we're now launching, you know, linear streaming into the portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.37-2669.95: This is a again a first step into a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2670.07-2679.04: You know, continued modernization journey for entertainment business that again in the end should be able to stabilize, you know, the total TV line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2680.18-2683.80: Over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2685.65-2691.23: Thank you. The next question comes from Stefan Gaufin from DNB. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2693.87-2700.28: I have a question on mobile or Appu. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2700.76-2702.44: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2702.62-2711.33: There was slightly weaker growth momentum on the Orpus side for both the consumer and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2711.35-2713.71: Business mobile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2714.11-2716.28: This quarter compared to Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2716.82-2722.88: I just wonder if that is a result of campaigning or if it's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2722.90-2728.01: Increased mobile competition or due to phasing or price increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.11-2733.71: Just help me understand sort of the development on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.73-2734.93: On mobile art book. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2736.72-2738.88: Okay, step on the start and then, Rick. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2739.68-2748.13: Hi Stefan, thanks for the question. On B2B, if you look at the comparison versus last year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.25-2751.37: It's true that we have a decline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2752.75-2755.38: But if you look on the long trend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2755.78-2761.58: That we are decreasing that revenue or after the client that we've seen in the B2B segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2763.14-2771.37: So looking at the efforts that we're doing, keeping more disciplined around our pricing guidelines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2771.39-2779.38: Focusing on value and making sure that we take a responsible stance in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2779.98-2787.45: And we're challenging ourselves all the time to make sure that we get the right price from our B2B customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2788.35-2797.76: We can see that it's actually resulting in improvements. If you compare to the Q3 and Q4 ASPO, it's a flat development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2798.82-2805.91: And also, if you look at the full year ASBU, we are on the same level as we were in both Q3 and Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2806.31-2810.83: So I would say the strategy is yielding results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2811.35-2819.08: And of course, bringing in more SME customers with a higher ASPU than the key and the public sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2819.80-2823.08: It works in the right direction for us in B2B. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2824.38-2828.45: I hope that answers the question and then I'll hand over to Henrik. Thank you, Stefan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2829.49-2836.62: Yes, Stefan and Stefan actually. So I will focus on the consumer side on the postpaid aspect Stefan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2837.18-2840.00: And basically what you see from Q3 to Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2840.48-2843.16: Is typically that in Q3... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2843.20-2846.25: Also this year actually still sort of in that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2846.27-2859.34: Light touch on COVID, we did have some good roaming revenues, as you may remember from our Q3 report. So that typically drives a higher, you know, ESPO in the quarter, which then of course, you know, coming out of the holiday season,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2859.36-2863.02: Has an effect on the, you know, ASBO in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2863.34-2866.09: Another thing is the main explanation. If you look... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2866.11-2875.72: At the underlying ASPU in the quarter versus last year, we've been growing by 2% and actually also versus full year, strengthening the ASPU development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2876.74-2883.60: And whilst you may think, well, from campaigning, there may be a little bit of a campaign lull. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2883.64-2894.09: You know, softer ASPU coming into the mix that of course to an extent is true but it doesn't have any effect on the overall, you know, customer base ASPU as such. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2894.13-2900.94: So I would say it's mainly in effect from a strong Q3 driven by typically roaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2901.50-2905.47: And first last year we see a 2% growth in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2908.67-2914.39: Okay, thank you. Good explanations from both of you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2918.48-2924.06: Thank you. The next question comes from Lan of Francesca Schilt from BNP Paribas Exane. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.29-2930.03: Thank you. And can I have one question, please, on wage inflation pressures? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2930.69-2933.43: So how do you think of wage inflation risk in Sweden? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2933.81-2936.62: And could you please remind us of the process? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2936.64-2945.13: For wage increase negotiations this year, when they'll take place and what you're projecting for the increase. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2947.37-2955.94: Well, the wage inflation in Sweden is pretty much determined by the central negotiations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.96-2961.20: I don't see anything dramatic coming out of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2961.28-2964.58: Those numbers are usually quite responsible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2965.47-2968.79: We do see a bit more wage inflation in the Baltics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2970.05-2977.06: That kind of goes with the overall growth that we see in the business and the economy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2978.16-2984.34: So there is more inflationary pressure in the Baltics than in Sweden. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2984.88-2992.75: Now the good thing about that is that the business in Baltics is also pretty good at pricing their services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2992.95-3002.94: I think the industry in general in Europe has struggled with focusing on this inflation adjustment of pricing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3002.96-3012.05: What BT is doing in the UK has maybe one way of doing it. We think our Baltic colleagues have been overall quite good at it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3012.25-3019.34: I think probably we could be even better at this in the Swedish market. But to be specific on your question,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3019.70-3029.59: Sweden, wage pressures seem to be kind of under control because they are centrally managed most of it, and the Baltics is also under control but will have a higher level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3033.53-3037.70: Do you think that in Sweden it will be similar? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3039.82-3042.90: And have the negotiations taken place? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3044.02-3053.91: I think we can expect overall those agreements to end up in the area of maybe 2.5%. Okay, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.94-3063.64: Thank you. The next question comes from Lan of Pontus Watchmeister from SCB. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3065.39-3068.53: Hi there, thank you for taking the questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3069.89-3072.35: On the marketplace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3072.39-3074.91: I focus on Sweden and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3074.93-3084.82: In regards to everything spoken about before the positioning in networks and your 5g position and the JV with Telenor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3085.79-3091.73: Can you describe to us just very top-down how important that is? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3091.75-3096.18: Going forward in terms of having a good position in 5g. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3096.20-3103.08: And the perception in the market of fast and strong networks and investments in those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3103.74-3107.23: And are you aligned with Telenor in that space? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3108.45-3118.06: Pontus, I should really thank you for that question because it's something I love to talk about. We have a quite unique position in European telecoms with our network cooperation with Telenor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3118.42-3124.92: So we run some part of Sweden on our own network, but most of it through Net4Mobility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3125.39-3132.57: And that gives a great advantage because we have the scale advantage and we have also very good spectrum, a very good spectrum position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3133.01-3142.78: So when the whole 2G, 3G, 4G market consolidates into one 5G market, that is actually a net positive for us at Tele2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3143.28-3148.95: Because the combination of net-mobility and our home networks will mean that in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3148.97-3154.15: Base stations and spectrum, we will have the strongest position in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3155.24-3162.28: Because right now we're operating with network corporations, with Sunab, with Telia, we have Net Mobility, we have our own. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3162.64-3166.81: Well, we consolidate all of this into one, with one network planning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3167.25-3171.49: We will have the biggest reach and we'll have a great spectrum portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3171.51-3180.60: We can't wait to get through this because it will, if anything, strengthen our position towards both B2B and B2C consumers in the Swedish market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.11-3194.41: Okay, thanks. And it's becoming more important towards the consumer you feel, or is it because in the beginning, you know, people weren't aware, but now you feel that speed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3194.43-3198.32: Efficiency is more of a divider in the marketplace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3199.60-3207.57: I think we have a good 4G network now, but the good news is that when we're moving on to the next technology and we can re-plan the network. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3207.91-3214.07: We will be able to have better reach with fewer base stations because we're not sharing in multiple relationships here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3214.09-3218.48: That whole planning has a significant efficiency in it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3218.94-3227.27: Actually, I think Jogers described that very well at our Capital Markets Day, so there is a clip out there that describes how that journey goes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3227.63-3230.33: So it's something that we are really looking forward to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3231.99-3233.39: And maybe to add upon this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3233.69-3241.38: I think if I look at the typical consumer behavior and uptake on, for example, new phones and handsets, you see quite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3241.40-3243.68: Quite a lot of the phones that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3243.70-3252.47: We've been shipping also in the fourth quarter are 5G ready and that's sort of making its way into the market quite quickly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3252.49-3254.11: A natural uptake by the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3260.80-3267.57: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Fox-Rumley from HSBC. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.55-3277.44: I wanted to ask a slightly general question about the way you're thinking on phasing of customer growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3278.64-3288.21: And from my perspective, today's results show the machine is kind of working. You can turn it on when you choose. That allows you to dip in and out of the market to optimize your return on spend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.29-3290.73: But are you saying from today that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3290.75-3299.84: You prefer kind of maintaining business momentum, so it's better to have a slightly smoother approach to customer growth through the course of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3299.92-3307.13: Or is it really just that you're kind of correcting for what was a very unusual first half last year? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3307.69-3313.53: And then I wondered, following up on that previous question, whether you're on the question on CAPEX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3314.17-3319.80: You've begun the big ramp up in spend. I wonder if you could just say a few words about how that's going. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3320.28-3325.29: Whether you're seeing any issues or any areas where you're ahead of plans, that kind of thing. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3327.01-3331.29: Okay, so looking at our positioning in the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3331.75-3338.76: I'm very happy to see that we have a much higher accuracy now than we had when I joined. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3339.26-3343.04: And that is because a lot of people have worked hard on getting their data right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3343.58-3352.85: One of the reasons why Stefan is successful in B2B is that they do much better analysis now. B2B used to be very volume driven, you go back in time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3353.25-3363.06: Now they are much more accurate about the customer needs. They have a much more interesting and relevant discussion with our large customers and solutions customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3363.34-3367.57: And that is how they can provide value to these customer relationships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3368.13-3371.99: One of the things we want to get out of our business transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3372.07-3381.52: Beyond saving cost is that Hendrik in cooperation with Jogesh will work much more with big data, be much more accurate in our go-to-market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3381.86-3390.55: Tele2 has a history of being a very successful challenger and that was great in a growing market and where you didn't have such a huge long tail. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3390.85-3395.10: Now we are a converged FMC player who need to be much more accurate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3395.40-3397.86: And that level of accuracy has increased a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3398.16-3400.38: And what Hendrik brings to business here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3400.54-3410.43: It brings many things, but one of the things it brings is a deep understanding not only of mobile markets and not only of broadband markets, but also the TV side of the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3410.77-3413.07: So the whole picture comes together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3413.13-3423.48: And for us to be more surgical in our approach between value and volume, we need more and bigger data. And that's what we're getting into place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3423.56-3425.53: That is one of the key things that is happening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3426.21-3429.85: And on the rollout of the 5G, it's moving ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3430.19-3437.80: We actually were able to do a little bit more towards the end of the year than we expected, so that momentum has really picked up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3438.18-3445.25: So we think a lot is going to be built out in 2022 and the main momentum will be done and finished by. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3445.27-3448.97: 23 would of course some build out in 24. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3449.69-3454.11: The guidance for our CAPEX, you have it, will be at the upper end, clearly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3455.18-3460.44: But we have transparency on that, we have visibility on that. It's looking pretty good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3462.74-3465.81: That's very helpful, thank you. If I could just follow up on that first question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3466.35-3478.96: In terms of the staff requirement to become better and more capable with big data, is Tele2 seen as a place where that is a great career option to be able to have that opportunity? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3480.26-3482.36: I'll start and then if you guys want to chip in please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3483.08-3489.13: One of the things that I did after coming here was to move the big data resources out from being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3489.15-3493.33: More of a staff function to being directly in the line of business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3494.07-3498.28: We have people here who are truly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3498.30-3504.54: Capable and they are actually quite motivated now because they are much closer to where it happens. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3504.68-3506.29: Much closer to the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3506.67-3513.55: So they have really quite a lot of energy in putting into their work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3514.31-3521.02: And it seems like they're coming up with a big value add. Do you want to add something, guys? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3522.58-3530.33: Well, from a B2B perspective, I would say that in the past, Intelle2, we have underinvested in the business intelligence side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3531.35-3533.95: That is something that we are changing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3533.97-3540.94: And which we started already next year with the program in becoming more data driven. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3540.96-3545.33: And to Kjell's point in different manners of running the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3545.83-3549.49: We will continue to do that also this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.87-3559.28: And I think the cooperation that we have with the unit within our technical organization with the skill set that they bring. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3559.52-3573.97: Cooperation between the commercial and technical parts that will yield better control, better performance and execution going forward in all aspects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3574.05-3579.10: And not just commercial I would say, but also from a customer experience perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3579.12-3584.72: And a production perspective. So really, really looking forward to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3587.05-3590.65: Well, maybe, Adam, just add to the, you know, from a consumer point of view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3591.35-3600.92: I think customer value management, you probably pick it up also, other operators, it's really a way to go as you go into a converged strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3601.24-3609.67: That's where we still have a lot of opportunity and mileage to go and as you know, as Shau was alluding to earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3609.75-3618.88: The IT transformation is quite essential to get that done so that we can really not just have the data but also act on it through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3618.96-3627.49: How we build propositions, how we get the intelligence to the channels and etc. So we're in full motion of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3627.57-3633.07: And there's clearly a lot of potential still to come out of this as we go through 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3637.64-3644.04: Thank you. And the last question comes from line of Abhilash Mohapatra from Bernbeck Bank. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3645.93-3648.65: Yes, good morning and thank you for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3649.43-3656.02: I just wanted to come back to the comments around driving improved offline growth in Sweden, please, in context of the guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3657.04-3667.09: In 2021, group service revenue growth of 1% but all of that was driven by the Baltics with Sweden declining half a percent and Q4 actually softening a bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3667.63-3672.45: So just to confirm, within the 2022 guide, what are you assuming for Sweden, please? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3672.59-3681.16: It looks like consensus has around 1% growth for Sweden in both consumer and business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3681.18-3684.04: You're comfortable with. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3686.07-3688.69: I can start, first of all I think it's very important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3688.71-3690.09: See the trends over time here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3690.13-3691.69: So going from a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3691.71-3700.60: A quite significant negative trend in B2B to being a stable business was what we said we would do and we've done it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3700.62-3707.09: And then of course we want to take it from there. Stefan and I and others will work hard to deliver meaningful growth there also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3707.97-3714.73: And then, of course, we've seen volumes picking up a bit in consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3714.75-3719.70: Our ambition is that all the main lines of the business, meaning the Baltics,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3720.00-3727.67: B2C Sweden, B2B Sweden should be delivering to the overall growth momentum of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3728.33-3738.02: And then of course it will vary over time where the biggest contribution comes from. Clearly in the short term it will be the Baltics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3738.44-3740.00: Anything you want to add. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3740.80-3742.54: No, I think you've put it well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3743.60-3752.03: I mean, during the year we set the strategy for B2B with specific cornerstones that we shared with you at the Capital Market Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3752.69-3759.56: We are delivering on that strategy to the full extent that's our focus and also to be consistent in regards to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3759.58-3763.58: To strategy and these corridors with segmentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3763.60-3767.37: Being a digitization partner, operational excellence, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3768.23-3773.73: And we set the ambition to make a major trend shift during 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3773.83-3780.28: 10.21 which shall just mention, I mean, we have delivered on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3780.82-3785.55: And then we are on the path of having the ambition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3785.57-3791.27: To be stabilizing the revenue growth that you saw in the last quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3792.83-3800.26: Hopefully that answers the ambition that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3800.28-3809.63: Minus 7 in 2020 to that level that we see now with two consecutive quarters with positive growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3810.77-3818.36: We're proud of that delivery, but we're not satisfied. We will push forward going into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3821.56-3823.64: Okay, did we have Nick or we are? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3827.23-3831.09: And the last question comes from line of Nick Lyle from Sogan. Please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3832.33-3834.01: Thanks very much. Thanks for squeezing me in there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3835.06-3843.70: A quick question please, Cheryl. I was looking at the in-lounge survey, the end of 2021 in-lounge survey,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3844.06-3849.15: Well, could you just explain why that is or is not a true reflection of this sort of network quality? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3849.59-3854.83: I'm sure we'd be concerned about your ability to close the gap on Telia's mobile prices because of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3855.42-3863.48: And then secondly, apologies if I missed something because I got cut off a couple of times, but I take your point about the broadband campaigns annualizing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3863.94-3865.27: If you were able to remove that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3865.29-3877.48: Would we see in the numbers you making some headway by taking share from Telia because of their rises in broadband prices? Could you just explain the sort of background to the market on the fixed side and the broadband side in particular? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3877.62-3879.88: What sort of share you might be taking X those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3880.00-3881.30: End of campaigns, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3882.56-3889.87: So I'll do one and maybe Henrik does two. So what you are highlighting is an opportunity for Teletubbies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3890.05-3895.86: We have a good network today, and then of course there will always be surveys, there have always been surveys as long as I've been in this industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3896.20-3906.13: But what I tried to say on the previous question is that going into the setting up the 5G networks, where we can have a one network,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3906.41-3908.23: Under our own control. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3908.63-3911.71: And not have multiple cooperations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3912.13-3917.18: The corrobation net probability is tested over time. It works really well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3917.56-3920.82: We are in a good relationship with our partner there, with Telenor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3921.26-3928.87: So 5G brings an opportunity for us to capitalize on that gap that you are pointing out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3929.05-3941.80: Because clearly we moving forward with T2 becoming a converged player, quality player, gives us a chance to lift Aspurs over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3941.96-3943.64: So, uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3943.72-3961.18: When we come out end of 2023 and early 2024 with great coverage and great spectrum and a very strong 5G proposition, that gives us an opportunity to equalize some of that gap that you are pointing out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3961.36-3962.92: So it's a good opportunity for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3963.72-3973.31: And the shell it and it will be an opportunity to carry on that growth momentum I think also through more on the mobile aspect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3975.20-3980.84: For us, you know, as such. And then on the fixed charges, to briefly comment on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3981.86-3988.91: Underlying, I think we have still a good trend. Of course, you need to look at the total market, of course, where we are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3989.01-3992.07: We've gotten and if you look traditionally versus where we are now, of course, you know,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3993.27-3996.12: We do have a mature and quite penetrated market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3997.52-3998.80: However, the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3998.82-4002.26: Campaign momentum that I was alluding to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4002.28-4011.01: Is that of course you need campaigns to an extent to drive your net ads on the one hand, but on the other hand,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4011.77-4019.70: But in this quarter in particular we've seen two of these quite successful campaigns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4019.72-4022.02: You know, coming out, rolling out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4022.06-4024.48: And that has been that specific effect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4024.90-4038.56: So yes, you need campaigns to drive it. Of course, these need to be well sort of planned and scheduled that you don't have these sort of effects that we've seen in this quarter in particular, which we're doing as we go forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4039.42-4048.83: And as we also execute on the FMC strategy, and we will be able to, as we have been alluding to,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4048.85-4052.79: Get more out of the customer base and customer value focus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4053.31-4058.84: We will also be able to address some of the churn levels and see some churn reduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4058.86-4064.98: A continuation on driving campaigns that are well planned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4065.59-4071.87: In combination with really driving the FMC momentum throughout 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4072.39-4077.82: I think will give us a good underpinning for our broadband business going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4080.00-4089.45: Thank you, dear participants. Thank you very much for all your questions today. I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Cheryl Jensen, for the closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4090.65-4097.26: Yeah, thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning to go through the full year of 21 and our outlook for 22. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4097.40-4105.97: I'm very happy that we could close the year on a relatively high note, with basically living up to the guidance increase that we gave you in July of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4106.37-4112.35: And that we are now sitting with a guidance that is higher than we had 12 months ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4112.77-4115.98: We have increased our dividend by 12.5%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4116.10-4123.00: And we are recommitted to, of course, as we always are, to the dividend policy and the capital allocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4123.62-4127.67: So things are looking good, we're going to deliver on our transformation program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4127.77-4137.08: And we're going to make sure that that does not interfere with our ability to drive growth momentum also in the Swedish market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4137.52-4145.35: So we're making these judgment calls and I'm pretty positive about the outlook. So thanks for joining us today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4151.25-4154.07: Participating. You may all disconnect. Have a nice day. 
asr:0: END
