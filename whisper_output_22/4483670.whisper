asr:0: OUTPUT 405.93-415.80: Compared to the previous quarter due to the increased debt amortization resulting from the acquisition of four LNGs in the fourth quarter and the inclusion in the capital reserve of $8.5 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 415.82-423.72: Corresponding to an additional non-cash reserve that our board has decided to set aside in view of the bond that we issued in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 424.72-431.69: The additional reserve represents the amount that we would need to accumulate per quarter in order to repay the bond in full on maturity.

asr:0: OUTPUT 492.41-500.12: The increase is attributable to the assumption of $876 million of debt in connection with the acquisition of the six LNGCs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 501.56-508.63: The incurrence of another 36 million of debt in connection with the acquisition of the three Panamax container vessels in February 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 509.17-516.10: And the issuance of 150 million euro in senior unsecured bonds on the Athens exchange. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 517.14-521.62: The increase was partly offset by the sale of two 9000EUs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 521.64-525.41: And the debt repayment under the respective financing arrangements.

asr:0: OUTPUT 552.31-556.32: NAME? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 556.52-568.09: Successfully completing the acquisition program of six high-specification, latest-generation, two-stroke XDF Mark III Flex LNG carriers with long-term employment in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 568.11-570.29: Exceeding 1.2 billion in value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 571.59-576.50: Specifically, the six ships were acquired at an average price of just short of $204 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 576.80-581.40: And are under long-term time charters with BP, Chenille and Engie. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.64-589.03: With a weighted average remaining charted duration of 5.7 years and an average rate of approximately $70,000 per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 590.03-593.71: As the 4 LNGs were delivered towards the end of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 593.73-598.80: We expect to see the full impact on the partnership's financials in the first quarter of 2022.

asr:0: OUTPUT 611.73-621.30: On slide 7, you can see our debt repayment schedule through 2028. Effectively, we don't have any significant debt maturities until the end of 2026. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 622.08-626.95: The only significant near-term maturity is that of the HCOB Syndicate facility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 626.97-632.41: Which matures at the end of 2023 with a balloon payment of 73.5 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 633.85-641.42: I would like to highlight that presently the charter-free market value of the collateral fleet is about 10 times the value of the balloon payment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 642.16-649.03: As a result, we not only expect this refinancing to be very straightforward, but also a potential lever for additional liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 651.35-659.14: Now moving to slide 8, the partnerships remaining charter duration amounts to approximately 4.9 years on the back of the six vessel acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 659.22-666.35: While charter caverns remains high throughout the next four years thus providing our unit holders with increased cash flow visibility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 668.23-676.28: On slide nine, you can see our contracted revenue on aggregate and on a per year basis, as well as the contracted revenue contribution from each of our charters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 677.10-679.90: Importantly with the addition of the six LNG carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 680.36-686.87: We have secured significant contractual revenue of close to $290 million for 2022 and 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 687.51-696.98: While contract revenue remains high until 2025, when certain of our container vessels roll off their charters, if certain options are not exercised. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 699.28-703.66: We are also pleased that our charter portfolio consists of seven high quality counterparties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 703.68-710.11: Having diversified our customers base with the addition of three investment grade charters namely BP, Chenier and Engie. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 710.91-716.06: BP represents our largest customer and accounts for about 40% of our contracted revenues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.36-721.34: Turning to slide 10 and the LMZ market update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 722.22-730.53: The fourth quarter started with a common winter pattern of a very tight freight market, with global LNG exports setting an all-time record during December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 730.55-732.61: Led primarily by US exports. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 733.53-741.50: However, the inversion of the commodity price spread between Europe and the Far East led to a weaker spot market for LNG carriers towards the end of the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 741.64-746.91: As the flow of cargoes to Europe instead of the Far East adversely affected ton-mile demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 747.73-757.18: Overall, demand fundamentals for LNG shipping remain robust as liquefaction capacity is expected to grow by 8.7% in 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 757.20-759.20: 23 and 2024 respectively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 759.82-762.82: With most of the additional new capacity being added in the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 763.62-771.81: In particular about 75 metric tons per annum or MTPA of additional liquefaction capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 771.85-775.20: Is expected to go online in the US by the end of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 775.30-778.34: Compared to 70 MTPA today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 780.66-789.91: The LNG fleet order book stands at 27% of the current fleet, with 30 new orders placed during the quarter, utilizing almost all available... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 789.93-794.43: Shipyard LNG carrier slots up to mid 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.56-799.76: As a result of increased demand and the strong fundamentals of the LNG market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.78-806.93: Competition for belts from other segments such as the container market, as well as inflationary pressures in raw materials and equipment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 807.39-816.58: Shipyards are continuing to increase new building prices with shipyard quotes currently in excess of 220 million per vessel for higher specification LNG carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 818.40-826.47: They increased LNG commodity prices and chartered preference for larger cargo sizes as the LNG export market continues to expand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 827.01-832.33: Favours increasingly latest generation two-stroke LNG carriers such as the vessels owned by CPLP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.27-843.52: The rate differential in view of the increased cargo intake, lower effective boil-off and lower consumption in a world of a $25 LNG price per MMBTU. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 843.64-853.23: Has increased to $40,000 per day compared to a TFT vessel and $70,000 per day compared to a steamship for a US to Euro-Bron trip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 854.31-863.02: At the same time, as we see increased focus on greenhouse emissions and shipping in general, and for LNG carriers in particular, including methane emissions,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.04-873.95: The preference for the latest generation vessels will become even more pronounced and as a result lead to an even greater earnings differential between latest generation LNG carriers and older vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.06-879.66: On slide 11, we review the container markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 880.82-888.75: Momentum remained very strong during the fourth quarter and into early 2022, with freight and charter rates surging to record highs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 889.67-897.10: The Clarksons Container Ship Chatter Rate Index stood at 362 points in December, up 280% since the beginning of 20... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 898.88-907.09: Also underscoring the strength of the market, a 15-year-old standard 8,500 EU vessel was fixed recently for five years at $64,000 per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 908.35-914.85: Record charter rates have been driven by a range of factors including strong demand, exceptional freight rates, severe logistical disruption,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 914.87-920.86: And the trend towards longer periods that has restricted Donovan's availability, especially the larger sizes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.72-927.47: Looking ahead, the outlook remains positive for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.53-938.26: Low new build deliveries at approximately 1 million T.U. For this year and vessels that have been fixed on medium to long term period charters last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 938.28-943.04: Are expected to keep donuts availability limited also in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 944.56-948.79: As such, demand growth is expected to outstrip supply growth for a second consecutive year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 949.61-958.74: Overall demand growth is now expected at 3.8% for 2022, with supply growth forecast standing at 3.6%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.48-968.13: In addition, the appearance of the highly contagious Omicron variant has exerted further pressure on logistical change worldwide, thus further restricting vessel supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 969.79-978.64: Nevertheless, the medium to long-term demand outlook remains more challenging due to the potential tapering of stimulus measures and easy monetary policy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 980.76-989.29: Resulting in increasingly more normalized consumer spending. If this coincides with an easing of the logistical bottlenecks, which would release more capacity in the container market,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 989.93-998.78: We can potentially see a slowdown in terms of freight and charter rates that might be further adversely affected by increased new build deliveries from 2023 onwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1000.38-1008.43: On the order book front, after the massive surge of orders during the first three quarters of 2021, we have observed a noticeable slowdown in contracting during the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1009.81-1017.50: During the quarter it is estimated that 56 container vessels were ordered, which compares to an average of 171 vessels during the first three quarters of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1018.52-1026.89: Overall, the container vessel order books stood at 23% in mid-January, up just 0.4% from the third quarter of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1028.95-1030.65: Now moving to slide 12. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1030.67-1039.82: We're very pleased that our board has announced an increased quarterly distribution by 50 percent to 15 cents per quarter for the fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1039.90-1046.97: And together set a new increased distribution guidance of 15 cents per quarter as a result of the addition of the six... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1046.99-1055.98: LMG carriers to the partnerships fleet and the expected associated increase in earnings and cash flow going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1058.60-1064.62: Overall, we intend to continue to return capital to our unit holders, as we have done every quarter since our IPO in April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1065.91-1075.68: Over the last 15 years. The partnership has paid non-stop distributions for 58 consecutive quarters, corresponding to a total of approximately 960 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1075.70-1081.18: Including 819 million in cash distributions and 140 million in distributions in kind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1082.60-1089.19: Going forward, we expect to continue increasing our common unit distribution as we increase our distributable cash flow with new additions to our fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.93-1097.86: In addition, having the six LNG carrier acquisition programs behind us that strained our liquidity during the third and fourth quarters of last year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.48-1102.74: We can now resume our unit buyback program which we put in place early last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1103.70-1112.75: As mentioned earlier, since the launching of the unit buyback program in February 2021, we have repurchased common units in the amount of $4.5 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1114.65-1123.40: Now turn to slide 13 and in terms of future growth opportunities, there are a number of additional acquisitions that we are targeting in the short to medium term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1124.34-1128.59: In the short term, our primary focus will be the vessels for which we have a right of first offer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1129.73-1134.01: A right we obtained as part of the agreement for the acquisition of the six LNG carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1134.71-1142.06: This includes three 13,000 EU container vessels with delivery from the third quarter of 2022 until May 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.56-1145.83: And which have a 10-year firm time charter in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1146.99-1150.71: As well as three additional LNG carriers with delivery in 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1152.27-1161.90: The Asterix One is the first LMG carrier to be delivered in January 2023 and has secured time-shutter employment for a minimum of 5 years at a highly attractive rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.46-1173.13: In addition to the above vessels, Capital Maritime has entered over the last few months into additional new bidding contracts for three more LNG carriers with delivery set for 2024. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1175.62-1181.62: As these three additional LG vessels find deployment and subject to our ability to acquire these vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1181.70-1190.93: CPLP can potentially become one of the very few companies that control a fleet of 12 brand new, latest generation LNG carriers with a unique portfolio of charters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1191.89-1200.12: As explained earlier, we anticipate that two-stroke, latest generation LNG carriers like the vessels we already own and these potential drop-down candidates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1200.16-1203.22: Will benefit greatly from the LNG market fundamentals ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1206.19-1212.35: The total market value of the 6 LMG carriers and the 3 13000U containers approximately 1.7 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1212.37-1216.36: Thus giving us a strong growth pipeline for 2022 and beyond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1217.14-1221.06: And as we continue to grow the partnership's asset base and the distributable cash flow,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1221.20-1227.25: We will also seek to increase the amount we pay out to unit holders in the form of common unit distributions and unit buybacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1227.29-1235.44: Thus executing our stated strategy of continuing to grow the partnership's asset base, and at the same time returning capital to our unit holders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1236.76-1239.66: And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1242.70-1246.53: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question and answer session. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1246.93-1255.88: If you'd like to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone and wait for the automated message stating your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.06-1262.64: Once again, it is star and one if you like to ask a question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1264.98-1273.21: And your first question is from Liam Burke of B Riley. Please go ahead. Thank you. Hi, Jerry. How are you? Hi, Liam. I'm well. How are you? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1276.44-1279.00: Liam Burke B Riley. Hi Jerry, how are you doing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1280.32-1284.14: Liam, I'm very well, how are you? Can you hear me well? I can hear you just fine, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1286.27-1290.13: With this predictable cash flow and the fleet you have in place,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1291.11-1299.04: You should be generating excess cash above your normal debt repayment and your unit payouts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1300.18-1310.07: You talked about repurchasing some units opportunistically. Do you balance that against possibly accelerating your debt reduction? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1312.65-1317.32: I think given the long term... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1317.34-1320.34: Employment we have in place and the associated cash flows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.78-1330.95: As well as the fact that some of our existing debt amortizes faster the first few years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1331.95-1340.16: Especially those that are associated with the loan facilities that are associated with the BP ships, given the structure of the charter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1341.26-1348.05: I think we are quite well placed in terms of debt repayment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.37-1358.56: In addition, if you look at our overall LTV, despite the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1358.58-1366.71: Despite us incurring quite a bit of additional debt in order to acquire the six LNGs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1368.07-1377.00: Our gross leverage is still on the back of current charter-free values at approximately 46%, which is quite reasonable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.48-1387.21: So in view of the accelerated debt repayment that we have in place, in any case, for the next two, three years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1387.55-1390.37: As well as overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1390.39-1398.20: Leverage and long-term employment and cash flows that we have in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1398.54-1403.26: I don't think we will be funneling additional cash towards that repayment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1403.98-1412.33: To. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.11-1421.00: There is some caution in the 23 to 25 timeframe of new container vessels coming online, obviously in the larger class. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.36-1431.47: But if I look at what you have, potential container carrier drop-down opportunities, those have nice long-term contracts associated with it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1432.35-1439.80: Are you biased one way or the other towards the LNG or container vessels in terms of what you'd prioritize on a drop-down? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1444.46-1452.21: A couple of things. Firstly, I agree with you, especially with very lofty expectations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.23-1455.34: Container prices compared to historical averages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1456.36-1464.99: One has to make sure that the employment that is in place in any potential acquisition, especially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1465.01-1468.15: When it comes to a conservative business model like ours. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1469.01-1478.64: You write down those vessels very close to what is historically unacceptable residual. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1479.06-1484.62: So having the 10-year charter in place, plus options, of course, for these LNG carriers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1485.63-1494.29: And of course, this will also depend on the negotiated sale price, will give us a lot of comfort with regard to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1494.81-1500.14: So we are not really taking a punt on the current container market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1502.12-1510.49: Secondly, with regard to the focus in terms of drop downs, I think that there is a lot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1511.55-1521.12: It's obviously what would qualify really for us are the 3 13,000 EU container ships and the LNG that has been fixed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1522.40-1530.23: The rest, I think, we'll have to wait until there is employment in place. Otherwise, it is simply too speculative. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.45-1535.44: We estimate that in very broad terms,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1535.46-1542.80: That these vessels will require equity of anywhere between $140-160 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.20-1547.57: And could generate an EBITDA of approximately $60 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1549.21-1554.61: So the question is, as you say, what can and what will you do out of those? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1556.16-1562.14: Subject to reaching a potential agreement on the acquisition of the ships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.02-1568.49: For the financing, we have numerous levers at our disposal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.81-1576.62: Firstly, as you pointed out earlier on, our free cash flow generation is expected to increase materially going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.86-1585.49: As we have the full impact of the six LNG carriers and that would be from the first quarter of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.17-1594.97: Secondly, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, there is some additional liquidity that we can source by refinancing central bank credit facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1595.80-1601.90: Which have ample of room if you have the relatively small debt balance is outstanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1604.06-1607.71: And thirdly, I think we will continue to look for attractive external capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1609.01-1617.96: You know sources could be the preferred equity market uh... The fixed income market that uh... And we successfully tapped uh... Last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1619.40-1624.58: And these sources could complement our internally generated cash flows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1625.51-1632.43: And potentially try to execute on all these four ships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1634.01-1639.90: But I think that will very much depend on what access we have in terms of external capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1640.68-1648.57: Again like uh... Last time uh... The priority is to avoid uh... Uh... Any issuance of common services uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.69-1654.87: Uh... This is uh... In view of the uh... By dislocation this is uh... Something that uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.89-1661.50: We will not entertain in the last... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1661.64-1668.37: Acquisition of the six LNG carriers despite the huge program we only issued 15 million dollars of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1668.39-1676.58: Of equity and I think it shows that this is the very last tool that we want to be using given the value dislocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.12-1681.24: So I think it will very much depend on whether there will be external sources of capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1681.60-1689.81: But if we can, ideally we would like to continue growing on both sides, that is both the containers and the LNGs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1689.83-1691.91: And the LNG front. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1693.21-1694.53: Veeam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1694.55-1699.32: Should I should add here that one of the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1699.34-1705.27: Main criteria going forward is that we are committing to buying only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1705.29-1711.49: Modern eco-vessels that are compliant with the latest regulations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1711.51-1713.71: EDI phase 3 compliance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1714.09-1717.04: That is very important so we will not be looking at older vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.44-1724.32: We believe that the residual risk of older vessels is not properly priced in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1725.65-1731.15: And in part distorted by the very lofty container market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1732.27-1739.78: But the hidden capex for many of the older vessels and the potential for even more punitive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1739.80-1744.26: Regulations after 2027 is quite significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1744.52-1750.71: So we are committing to acquiring only modern... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1750.73-1757.84: Latest regulations compliant vessels, eco-vessels, and potentially, if we find good opportunities, divesting from older assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1759.98-1761.72: Thank you, Jerry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1764.60-1772.53: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of around the Givens of Jeffreys. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1778.52-1787.49: Howdy Jerry, how's it going? I'm very well, how are you? Oh, doing well, doing well. Two questions. First, on your fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1788.17-1794.77: So you have 100% charter coverage for the next two years outside of two vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.83-1798.52: So let's discuss those. First, for the Cape Agamemnon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.78-1805.59: What's the current employment of that vessel and when can or maybe will you look to sell that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1807.35-1815.44: So the Cape Agamemnon has earned on average around $22,000 in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1816.06-1819.30: Its earnings are similar to the one that we have in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1819.32-1821.04: Year to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.98-1829.15: We continue to consider this vessel as a non-core asset, but we are very opportunistic about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.45-1834.69: We had discussion to sell the vessel in the summer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1836.04-1844.48: Since then, values have become softer and more importantly, liquidity in the market, especially for Cape-sized vessels, has somehow receded. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1844.92-1851.85: But we are monitoring this market and if we find a good opportunity we'll sell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1853.05-1860.28: Now if a great opportunity arises and you know for a six twelve months out there we might take it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1861.42-1866.01: But it doesn't change the view that this is not a known core asset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1867.93-1870.41: Okay. And then let's look at the academos. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.59-1875.56: I believe that was on charter through September of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1875.64-1883.60: Is there any kind of option for the charterer to extend that vessel or that container ship charter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1884.46-1885.53: It's not! 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1885.55-1894.11: I would assume you're already getting offers, right? For new longer term charters on that vessel. So let's see, updates are on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1895.72-1896.88: So on the academic side, I think that's a good thing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1896.94-1898.58: CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1898.60-1911.03: Holders hold an option to extend the charter which at its latest point, if the option is exercised, can take us to April 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1911.07-1912.13: 3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.13-1918.24: However, I should say that this is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1918.32-1924.72: One of the most efficient vessels out there with very high reefer capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1926.93-1932.85: So less than 10 ships of this size are expected to open up between now and... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1932.87-1937.12: It's earliest delivery, so we should be in a good place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1938.32-1941.10: And none of them have the referee intake that the Academy most has. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1941.70-1950.63: Also this being very fuel efficient and with the momentum on reducing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1950.65-1956.50: The carbon footprint of logistical chains this vessel should be very well sought after. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1956.76-1965.49: In my prepared remarks I mentioned that an 8500 DU, so a much less efficient vessel with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1965.51-1969.59: Lower referee intake was fixed for five years around $65,000. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.91-1974.29: That was for delivery in one, two quarters from now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.83-1984.10: So I assume that we should be able to fix forward if the market holds something along these levels, potentially higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.05-1989.83: Of course, like last time, if... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1989.85-1996.30: An offer comes to sell the vessel that we cannot refuse that we will entertain as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1997.70-2002.72: So I think we're very well placed. We have a fantastic asset for this market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2003.38-2006.97: It's as you say an active market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2007.49-2016.32: And we'll try to maximize returns, be it through the charter, which is what we are aiming for. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2016.54-2020.54: Or a sale if this is great value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2023.10-2030.11: That's all fair uh... But they are all people of the top five but one more on capital allocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2030.33-2038.68: Just curious how you maybe decided or the board decided on the distribution increase to 15 cents per quarter instead of maybe a higher number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2039.26-2047.63: And then with that, should we expect additional increases in the near term, or is this basically an annual step up? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2048.11-2054.83: And then lastly, how do you view unit purchases relative to increasing distributions at these levels? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2057.48-2060.00: Let me start with the last question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.82-2067.19: What we're thinking, returning capital to unit holders, I think it's, we're thinking of both. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2067.57-2074.83: And we see them in a way as an aggregate of money spent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2076.62-2080.00: So in terms of the unit buybacks... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2080.48-2089.89: We did about 4.5 million last year. We stopped very early in Q4 because we had to make sure we manage our liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2091.27-2095.54: Now that the liquidity is building up again, we can start spending again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.40-2100.00: You know overall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.62-2109.71: Last year we spent uh... Somewhere between uh... Uh... A quarter of our uh... Free cash flow to uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2109.73-2116.48: In retaining capital to unit holders, either through buybacks or quarterly distributions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2117.08-2123.44: I think going forward we are going to target a similar range, anywhere between a fifth to 25%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2124.78-2130.33: And as, let's say, our distributable cash flow increases with new additions... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2130.45-2141.82: We will be revisiting the distribution as the additions come in and in view of the wider growth plans. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.84-2143.04: And liquidity needs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2143.50-2151.63: So I think for the moment this is it, but if let's say we... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2151.65-2155.74: Deliver on more growth down the line. This is not far off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2155.86-2163.48: I mean, we talked about potential acquisitions in Q3, Q4 this year. We will again reexamine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2163.50-2170.89: The distribution as well as the unit buybacks in view of the impact of the new additions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2171.39-2178.70: So I think that's more or less how we're thinking about it. We have been also very clear with regards to the strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2180.40-2181.50: This is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2181.76-2192.11: We want and we will continue to return capital to unit holders, but this will be a combination with growing our asset base and disability cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.51-2200.60: I think we have done quite well so far and we have delivered both significant value in terms of an EV and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2200.62-2206.05: Total returns for unit holders and we will continue along these lines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2207.71-2214.35: Well, yeah, it's great. We increased the price target recently and you're almost there. So keep up the great work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2215.20-2219.28: Great, thank you, Randy. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2220.92-2229.27: There are no further questions. May I hand the call back to Mr. Kalogiratis for the closing remarks? Thank you all for joining us today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2235.16-2240.00: That concludes the presentation. Thank you for participating. 
asr:0: END
