asr:0: OUTPUT 2081.90-2088.41: To provide more detail first around lifting costs and then around production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2089.19-2096.18: So the first thing around nifting costs, if you look at where we ended up on 3Q around the $8 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2097.16-2103.16: We're signaling that the year should end up in around or at around $8.50 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2103.76-2109.33: For next year, the rate should be around $9.50 to $10 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2109.65-2111.55: That's the expectation.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2360.50-2361.72: So things that we're looking at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.30-2368.33: And there's some very tactical, pragmatic things that we're looking at. So, for example,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2370.37-2375.56: In a lot of the things in which we operate, for example, on a digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2376.46-2381.48: We have a lot of synergies and opportunities because we use the same providers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.00-2390.81: We can share some of the favorable conditions that Ecopetrol has on contracting some of these services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.93-2392.87: Those can be passed through to each. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2393.33-2398.40: So that's low-high improved, very early on, those things have identity.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2406.47-2410.13: So things like when you mentioned power generation, so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.67-2414.95: In Colombia by the current existing regulation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2415.14-2422.20: Since we are in transmission, we would not be allowed to enter the power generation market to sell to third parties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2422.84-2426.67: So that's the current regulatory framework in Colombia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2427.09-2434.01: Having said that, there's opportunities in the other countries where we do not have a presence. So that's point number one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2434.59-2443.02: But in terms of things like additional renewable, our generation projects from renewable sources,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2443.22-2446.03: There's a lot of opportunity both in country and outside. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2446.09-2448.19: In terms of energy storage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2448.47-2457.60: Which is fundamental as we think about the transition and sort of ensuring that there's reliability in terms of the provision of electricity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2457.74-2460.90: To the consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.72-2470.29: Even in things like hydrogen, low emission energy. The teams are actually working on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.31-2480.00: We're very enthusiastic, I would say, in terms of the new opportunities and there's a lot of things that are coming up from those conversations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2480.84-2489.77: What we'd like to do, Matthews, is that as soon or as long as we're progressing and advancing, we'll continue to communicate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2489.95-2491.53: You know, in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2491.79-2495.26: Where we are, how we've landed some of those off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2495.28-2502.92: Opportunities, but I would end up saying here before handing on to Walter is that a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2502.94-2508.93: I don't think we fully understand the potential that we can unlock. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2509.09-2514.07: In terms of the transaction that we've done and the opportunities going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2514.77-2522.18: Juan, why don't we move into the downstream to talk a little bit more about the margins and what we see going forward? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2524.06-2528.57: Thank you, Felipe. Thank you, Matthew, for your question on the downtrend business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2529.57-2535.76: I will start mentioning that you saw on the slide, it was covered by Alberto. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2535.78-2544.84: That as of September we have accumulated a record EBITDA of 2.3 billion pesos for the segment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2544.90-2549.39: This is mainly coming from excellent results in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2549.97-2557.00: Regarding the sales quota, it is important to mention that we started around July. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2557.02-2561.00: Activities at the Barranca Bermeja. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2561.42-2567.11: Refinery, mainly in the alkylation unit and the petrochemical business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.47-2574.69: Those activities at Barranca will continue. So those have already been completed, although. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2574.81-2583.98: We are progressing right now, maintenance, major maintenance on one of the crew units and on the FCC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2584.52-2593.99: In the case of Cartagena, the result of the third quarter was impacted by the blackout event that we had in August. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2594.89-2603.04: And also a maintenance that we needed to do at the FCC unit in August and finish in the middle of September. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.42-2605.83: At the Cartagena refinery, those were. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.85-2615.44: One-time events, both of them, and the refinery was recovered for those events and is running close to full rate right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2615.82-2620.00: And at the Cartagena refinery, we are projecting the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2620.06-2627.55: We are not projecting to have a plan turnaround or big maintenance at the Cartagena Refining in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2627.93-2633.97: We see Cartagena for the fourth quarter coming up in terms of margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2635.34-2641.42: At the Barranca, as I mentioned, we are executing the plan turnaround for the crew unit of the FCC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2641.80-2647.41: But marching for the baranca are planned to be steady for the fourth quarter and very similar to the third quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2647.71-2653.51: In overall, for the refining, we are projecting to finish 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2654.55-2656.50: Regarding a crude weight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2657.30-2663.86: We have told you that we are planning to be on the 345 to 365 KBDE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2664.06-2668.03: And we are projecting to be on the high side of that range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2668.47-2676.80: Regarding March for projection for 2021, we are projecting to finish the year between both business, Cartagena and Barranca. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2676.82-2683.24: On the upper side of the one digit, so close to the $10 per barrel for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2683.66-2690.03: Regarding 2022, I would say that we see margins coming up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2690.23-2698.98: Although I have to mention, during the first half of the year, we do have plant maintenance activities at both refineries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2699.00-2700.94: Barranca and Cartagena. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2701.26-2703.06: And mainly on the first half of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2703.74-2710.79: So, but in overall, we see a margin. There will be some ups and downs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.91-2715.34: Because that depends on what type of maintenance activities we do every month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.38-2724.22: But in overall we see margin for 2022 on the low side of the two digits for the refining business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2726.01-2728.87: And I think that I would like to mention that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.89-2731.57: 2020-2021 and 2022-2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2731.59-2740.98: To. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2741.02-2742.30: But because of COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2742.50-2750.43: We need to move some of those maintenance from 2020 to 2021 and 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2752.49-2756.08: I hope, Matthew, I was clear and I was able to answer your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2762.28-2766.19: Our next question comes from Vicente Falanga from Bradesco. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2768.37-2771.59: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2772.59-2781.46: My first one is regarding Brazil. When do you expect the drilling of the first well there? What are the next key milestones? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2782.54-2786.27: My second question is regarding to unconventional. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2786.67-2791.71: Do you feel that after you get the licenses for Calais and Platero? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2791.73-2799.20: That for other future potential areas, these licenses could come out quicker. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2799.86-2802.92: And then if I just may, sorry, a follow up on the previous question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2803.60-2809.05: Do you still see risks of public order in the Canyon Limon pipeline this quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2809.07-2814.07: That could again affect the refineries or things calmer there. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2822.42-2830.59: Vicente, good morning and thanks for the question. With regards to Brazil, what we are doing right now? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2830.77-2833.89: In terms of exploration,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2834.01-2841.78: Now we are in the planning phase to drill our second well in the Saturnoblock. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.80-2845.03: Which basically is what we call the Iapetus prospectus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2845.67-2851.99: And we expect to drill this well late in 2022 or early 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2852.97-2860.62: And this will depend very much in our conversations with our partners, in that case, Shell and Chevron. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2862.12-2871.59: Also, in terms of development, just to recognize that Gato Domato is going well and that we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2871.73-2875.64: Several milestones to complete them in the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2876.02-2882.04: The first one is the award of the FPSO, the Floating Production Storage and Uploading Facility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2883.10-2891.63: Initiate fabrication of the FPSO, also award the subsea facilities contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2892.33-2900.22: Depending on the advance and progress of those activities, we are shooting for an early. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2900.28-2903.42: At the end of 2025, early 2026. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2904.12-2913.11: That's the program. If we see opportunities to build additional wells, that will be depending very much on decisions taken with our partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2913.79-2916.96: So that's times where we are in Brazil, exactly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2921.48-2925.45: With regards to PEPFAR, the unconvention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.47-2935.66: So we're in the process, as we mentioned in our report, in the process of obtaining the licenses for Calais and Pateno. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2936.12-2941.40: We already delivered the environmental assessment study for Calais. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2941.98-2947.17: And we are trying to do so for Platero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2947.87-2949.25: So,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2949.41-2957.92: In terms of whether this will increase the potential of getting licenses for new areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2958.36-2966.17: I will be very conservative. I think our focus should be in the two areas where we have at this moment the climate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2966.71-2976.54: Once we are successful in getting the licenses, as well as doing the execution of the wealth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2976.64-2982.24: Doing the drilling of the wells, then we can foresee if there are opportunities in other places. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2983.72-2989.57: I guess I would probably just like to add, and before you come back to Pena Limon, and the third question is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2990.73-2999.86: What we've said, Vicente, with regard to the unconventional pilots in Colombia is that this is not about doing it quickly. It's about doing it well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3000.42-3009.53: In that sense, and you saw some of the timelines that we produced in the report, we see ourselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3009.99-3015.98: But we're working to see if we can actually accelerate that. Can we bring that forward into 2020? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3017.32-3020.92: But bear in mind that after we have all the results and the data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3021.36-3028.27: There is an independent commission that will look at the results of the pilot and determine if the pilots were successful or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3028.79-3034.09: In terms of achieving the objectives that were set up with the regulations to the pilot. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3034.73-3038.74: We'll need to see what that means. Having said that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3038.76-3044.10: Obviously, we've worked on identifying additional areas with potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3044.24-3051.29: And thinking about how can we take this to the next level in terms of becoming part of the operation that we do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3051.35-3055.66: We now have a lot of expertise from the Kermian to use under our belt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.54-3059.84: So that's being brought home. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3059.86-3064.66: In terms of planning and ensuring that we can understand how to move. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3064.68-3070.15: To the next phase, which if I understand correctly, is sort of the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3070.57-3072.81: And I'm very concerned so far, and in one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3073.57-3079.36: Well, in terms of Pano Limón, we need to recognize that we have the pressure of social unrest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3079.56-3083.80: And guerrilla activity in both the Catatumbo and the Arauca regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3084.46-3091.91: So the risk is there, but we have the contingency means to manage the production impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3092.27-3097.62: If the Tanya Limon pipeline is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3097.64-3104.98: Affected by this social number, then we have the contingent route of the best-in-scenario pipeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3105.63-3113.07: If this is working, as has been working during the third quarter, where we have 11 reversal cycles,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3113.69-3121.36: Then we shouldn't expect major impact in terms of the loads for the refiners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3133.41-3138.80: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank McGann from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3140.48-3149.81: Thank you very much. Just stepping back to a little bit bigger picture in terms of how you're seeing the CapEx potential in upstream. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3150.13-3153.75: After the last four or five years, which I think is a long time, I think I've been doing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3153.91-3160.98: You went from having a lot of opportunities and being very aggressive to pulling back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3161.02-3163.54: Is rightfully so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3163.56-3174.17: Restore the balance sheet and not get overly aggressive in terms of spending given the less clear environment especially of course over the last 18-24 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3174.79-3178.56: I'm just wondering now how you're thinking about upstream. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3178.68-3185.13: You've got, I would assume, a lot of low-hanging fruit that you could potentially exploit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.19-3198.68: I would think you could increase CapEx quite a bit and profitably so if you wanted to, but I'm just wondering how big that portfolio is potentially. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3198.72-3209.69: Are you tempted to get more aggressive over the next couple of years given the very favorable environment and fairly short payback period that you have for a lot of those investments? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3215.68-3216.76: Thank you, Ms. Pratt. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3216.78-3219.32: Great question, and I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.86-3228.21: I'll provide you some views and then Jaime can add up and Alberto as well and the team can start to basically complete the views. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3229.17-3231.41: The way I would put it,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3231.49-3233.21: I like your... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3233.23-3243.68: Your intro to the question in terms of us being very careful with the management of the balance sheet and the opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3244.32-3250.67: And if you look at how we've ramped up CAPEX over the last few years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3250.69-3259.34: From $2.2 billion in 2017 to $2.9 billion in 2018 to $3.5 billion in 2019. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3259.42-3260.94: Will be that range this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3261.02-3267.11: I was answering a question earlier saying that we see ourselves in the four to five. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3267.13-3271.21: Billion dollar range organic excluding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3272.05-3276.80: And historically, 80 to 85% of the CAPEX has gone to the upstream. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3277.36-3285.19: We're not going to abandon that. There will be additional focus in terms of exploration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3285.99-3288.75: And this goes from a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.77-3296.32: Looking at seismic that we already have and doing the reinterpretation of that seismic with new technology and new capabilities,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3296.82-3298.06: So that's point number one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3298.60-3302.60: And I think the news that we gave the market share during the week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3302.62-3310.31: With the media AW well, which is the discovery of a new field show that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3310.33-3313.85: So adjusting our view on exploration is paying off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3314.11-3315.46: And I think that's very important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3316.50-3319.38: This year we'll end up with some 400 wells. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3320.00-3326.99: In our portfolio that we've drilled development wells, we should probably see an increase in that and that's the way you need to think about it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3327.53-3330.57: If you look at geographically,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3330.87-3333.83: We have a very good activity team at Birmingham. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3333.97-3341.82: It's not only providing molecules or barrels, but it's also producing good EBW. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3342.18-3346.93: We'll be able to talk about that when we close the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3347.73-3356.92: So a lot of focus in Colombia, but we do have focus in both the Permian and Alberto was just referring to Gato D'Omato in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3357.34-3359.60: That will require some additional topics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3360.84-3368.11: But clearly, focusing on Colombia where EOR techniques, increasing recovery factors are fundamental. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3368.55-3374.39: We have to deal with a 15 to 17 decline, natural decline per year in our main fields. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3375.14-3377.98: Good news, I think tailwings are healthy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3378.52-3383.82: We've done a lot of work over the last four or five years in terms of efficiencies, in terms of becoming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3384.34-3390.25: A much better in terms of producing margin at the upstream level. So I think that's paying off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3390.85-3395.36: Having said that, we had a good discussion earlier on about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3395.40-3400.40: Sector information and some of the things that we're doing, but again things like serial phase budgeting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3400.76-3408.03: And something called Performance Plus, which is an internal program to look at more efficiencies, I think can provide a lot of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3408.07-3412.81: Support in terms of how we see ourselves going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3414.85-3417.30: We have identified lots of opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3418.08-3427.53: We have something called taxonomy, so we know which each and every opportunity that we have in the pipeline ranks up. But, and I'll stop here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3427.89-3433.67: We don't want to get crazy in terms of spending money just for the sake of spending money. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3434.09-3442.00: Stay very focused on discipline in terms of how do we deploy the CAPEX in the operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3442.62-3446.41: Jaime, if you want to add something else for Alberto, just hit me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3447.89-3449.41: Thank you, Felipe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3449.43-3451.55: So Frank, good to hear you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3451.65-3454.61: I'll give you some color and initially I'm going to... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3454.63-3464.52: I'm going to give you some broad group numbers that provide context for the conversation and then some directional numbers associated to the plan which we're working on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3465.31-3474.33: I think the biggest headline is that as we look to refresh the plan 22-24 in the context of a higher price environment,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3474.41-3478.66: And in the context, of course, of the production lag that we've seen this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3478.70-3483.78: Clearly, our strategic intent is to increase production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3484.16-3487.59: So directionally, what we want to do with the option is to increase production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3487.99-3496.90: And the good news is that the result of the portfolio analysis that we've been having over the last few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3496.92-3499.48: Is one that indicates a stronger portofolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3500.00-3505.83: With more prospects, with more possibilities and therefore with more value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3505.91-3516.26: To give you an idea, this year's plan compared to last year's plan speaks about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3516.28-3523.02: Maturing around 1.5 billion barrels of resources, of 3P resources. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3523.32-3525.17: That's the extent of the total for a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3525.39-3535.20: Last, when we were looking at this number 18 months ago, it was more in the 1.1 and our range. So we've actually seen a bigger portfolio to work. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3536.00-3546.27: The second thing that we're seeing is that in the context of the full agenda of a performance plus and efficiencies and becoming more competitive and the like,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3546.31-3552.37: We are also seeing improved rate keeping and therefore more value associated to the portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3552.55-3564.32: So, directionally, a portfolio that maybe a couple of years ago was worth, and I'm talking about the growth component of the portfolio, around $6 billion in NPD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3564.50-3567.71: It's now around $9 billion in MGB. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3568.05-3575.32: So where I'm trying to go here is that there's value to be had and we want to chase that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3575.44-3583.96: Obviously in a distinct way like Felipe mentioned, in a structured way, but there's value to be created. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3584.56-3592.71: When you look at the ramp up of activity, the ramp up of activity that we expect to have in theory is significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3593.09-3602.12: We're talking about directionally around 540 development wells next year, around 600 workover. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3602.14-3611.51: A workover around anywhere between 25 and 30 exploration wells and going back into sites. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3611.79-3617.50: So the opportunities are there and they are sufficiently mature. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3618.48-3622.88: All these numbers that I'm quoting, about 67% of the activity said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3623.00-3627.77: It's already in its third or fourth stage of maturing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3627.81-3636.70: So they're things that are reasonably good to go and it gives us confidence that we're going to be able to execute them this next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3637.12-3645.83: So that's where we're going. When you look at that number that Felipe mentioned of between $4 and $5 billion of organic CAPEX,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3646.57-3655.28: I would say that the upstream, as usual, will represent a big chunk of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3655.92-3662.60: When we look at the next three years, I would expect the option to be capturing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3662.62-3666.79: Probably anywhere between $10 and $12 billion of capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3667.13-3671.23: Upstream alone. That's where direction we're heading. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3671.41-3679.94: Obviously, this is all subject to some fine-tuning and we're going to have a more detailed conversation in February, but that's where our head is right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3681.24-3691.19: I will just add that when you look at our portfolio, years back our focus was on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3691.21-3695.01: Of the main mature fields, heavy oil fields. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3695.76-3698.92: So now in our plan, now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3699.06-3707.69: You'll see new areas emerging. For example, in terms of exploration, you'll see activity associated with the Caribbean offshore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3708.15-3713.95: And also a lot of focus in terms of the Piedmont foot hill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3714.53-3721.32: Where we have the expectation of finding both light oil and gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3721.98-3726.55: So you'll see that diversification when you look at other projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3726.59-3732.21: That are going to be emerged. You'll see Tanya Sur close to Rubiales and then Acacia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3732.23-3735.34: Which will be another focus in our portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3735.88-3740.50: So more diversification, I would say. Thanks, Agustin. Thanks, Heine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3744.12-3748.23: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Audi from Santa. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3751.05-3754.07: Thank you. Hello, Felipe. Hi, May. Hope you're well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3756.14-3760.80: I wanted to get your views on a couple of points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3762.34-3768.83: First, capital allocation and then on return on capital employed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3769.31-3775.34: In terms of capital allocation, you've already touched on CapEx. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3776.98-3779.78: I was wondering if you could also touch on the leveraging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3780.00-3782.88: And dividend payments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3782.90-3790.81: How you prioritize those given the very strong results and cash flow generation that you're having. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3790.83-3794.35: Also, touch on... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3794.37-3816.06: The potential need for an equity offering and whether that equity offering, if needed, would be more to supply ESA with capital to pursue inorganic growth or would it be more driven to just strengthen the overall Eco-Patrol financial position? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3816.70-3825.19: Then in terms of returning to employed, which is an area where you as a company always stood out relative to your peers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3825.49-3837.00: With the addition of ESA, it has great margins and great return on capital employed. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you see Rossi. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3837.10-3842.26: Maybe X is going into 2022, please. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3848.21-3851.69: Thank you, Christian. I hope you're doing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3852.31-3861.98: So let's talk about capital allocation and ROCHA. I'd first start with what is our view of the world going forward in terms of price environment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3862.14-3867.57: Because it actually does set the stage a lot around how to think about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3867.75-3874.13: Some of the questions you're making, capital allocation, deleveraging, dividends and the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3874.89-3886.33: And one of the things that we've seen is that fundamentals do support a more optimistic view. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3886.35-3889.21: Around prices going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3889.23-3890.79: You might recall that in the plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3890.83-3898.64: The plan that we're actually executing right now, our price assumption for this year was around $45 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3898.70-3902.08: Next year, we were looking at $50 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3902.42-3909.25: And that's something that we have been reflecting on and that we are going to update in our plans going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3909.59-3919.30: So the outlook in which we are planning ahead is one where next year is at $63 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3919.32-3922.62: And 23 and 24 are at 60. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3923.04-3932.97: These prices are still conservative when you look at the current headline price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3933.73-3942.18: But we believe that it can position us as well in a place where we can retain our capital and cost discipline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3942.56-3947.91: While at the same time making sure that we don't leave opportunities on the table. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3948.95-3954.71: The broader conversation around long-term price in this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3954.89-3962.46: We still remain conservative. We believe that all our projects need to fly at $50 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3962.56-3970.87: And that's in a view that when you look at the majority of our projects and the time to market associated with these projects, you're looking at the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3971.31-3972.81: So that's how we're thinking about this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3973.71-3982.54: So with that in mind, what are we looking at? What we're looking at, firstly, in terms of your question about leverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3984.20-3991.77: The 2.5 times growth step to EBIT decision that we have been operating is one that seems reasonable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3992.21-3996.76: It seems reasonable and it continues to be reasonable when you look ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3997.08-4007.85: What is the balance that we want to have? The balance that we want to have is one where we have a bit of space there to encourage them, whether it's for inorganic opportunities that might arise,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4008.01-4020.66: And also to capture or to reflect in our consolidated balance sheet the leverage that ESAT might have given that their ceiling is 4.5 times gross debt to EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4020.98-4027.31: Why is that important? Leverage is an engine of growth for ESHA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4027.65-4032.81: ESA has a pipeline of opportunities going forward that is very attractive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4033.11-4042.32: The more we look at it, the more excited we are. And we definitely don't want capital to be a constraint for ESA's growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4043.16-4047.33: So we are comfortable with that range that they're operating in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4047.87-4054.29: It's 3.5 to 4.5 times, and we wouldn't have any problem with these going to the very top end of that range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4055.16-4061.42: So with that, our range of 2.5 kind of makes sense. That's how we're looking at this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4061.92-4064.88: On leverage we're not going to stay put. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4064.92-4072.15: We just had this liability management transaction. We put $2 billion off our, if you will, off the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4072.27-4075.02: It was an expiry that we were going to have in 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4075.24-4079.96: Now we kick that off into the future and we intend to do that more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4080.00-4092.57: We believe that the fundamentals of the capital markets right now and the results that Eco Petroleum are delivering allow us to pursue more transactions like that into the future. So, directly, that's how we're thinking about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4093.09-4095.18: With regards to dividend payment,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4095.20-4103.82: You know our policy remains unchanged, 40-60% of net income and in good years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4103.84-4107.91: You should expect and we all should expect to be on the very high end of that range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4107.95-4116.12: That's how we're thinking ahead and that's how we're planning our cash and our capex accordingly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4116.54-4120.08: Equity offering, where does the equity offering fit in into all of this? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4120.32-4121.66: It's about optionality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4121.94-4123.46: It's about optionality, Christian. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4124.20-4126.71: The idea here is that a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4126.73-4137.00: While our spending is robust and we're comfortable with leverage and we're comfortable with our ability to fund these topics for growth, which is our main. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4137.06-4139.28: We want to continue growing the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4139.72-4150.55: We believe that the equity offering offers the optionality to support whether it's an increased. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4150.57-4158.94: Necessity of CAPEX, you know, that's competitive, whether it's organic or inorganic, or simply to strengthen the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4159.00-4162.66: Directionally, right now, it would be about strengthening the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4163.00-4167.59: It would be about reducing the depth that we have to get into a more comfortable level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4168.21-4177.24: Finally, with regards to your question around ROCHI, you might have seen that we posted a pretty solid ROCHI result on District Q. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4177.46-4182.48: 10.8% which is great, going back to double digits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4182.80-4191.09: It's a number that puts us in with very little company in our sector, very, very few companies are out there with us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4191.49-4192.77: And we're happy about that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4193.09-4198.82: When you include ESA in the equation, ESA is accretive. With ESA, we're actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4198.96-4205.81: Isa will probably add, once you normalize, temporary effects and the like, because obviously it's a consolidation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4206.15-4208.69: That you're seeing right now over your next one month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4208.97-4212.95: But once you normalize for, if you will, business as usual with ISSA,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4213.23-4220.36: Ethan is going to add probably four or five points into that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4220.52-4228.97: I would believe that hopefully by year-end we're going to be above 12% in terms of ROGI and we can sustain that into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4229.59-4231.85: Obviously, depending on price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4232.07-4235.28: But that's what we believe in right now. Thanks, Christian. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4239.72-4245.29: We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bayon for final remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4250.65-4257.96: Thank you so much and very, very quickly I'd just like to thank everyone for being here today at the conference call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4257.98-4265.53: Thanks again for following Ecopetrol for the interest that you put into our activities and how we continue to make progress. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4265.95-4273.57: Very good results for the quarter. Very good results not only in terms of numbers but in terms of how strategically we continue to advance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4273.95-4283.64: It's great to have now one month of ETH results into our consolidated sales. They're very, very pleased with the acquisition. It's going very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4283.82-4287.33: We continue to make progress in our TESG agenda. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4287.75-4290.85: And hopefully we'll be able to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4291.31-4300.00: Sit again with you guys virtually for year-end results and conversations around our plans going forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4300.80-4308.59: Hope that everybody stays safe, please stay here, and thanks again for being with us today at this conference call. Bye bye, ciao, gracias. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4310.93-4316.68: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
