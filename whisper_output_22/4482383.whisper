asr:0: OUTPUT 19.20-28.85: There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 30.07-35.44: I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sam Swannell, Group CEO. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 37.58-45.69: Good morning and thank you all for joining the Points But Holding Limited second quarter financial year 2022 business update and activities report. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 46.35-51.09: This is Group CEO Sam Swannell and I'm joined on the call today by our Group CFO Andrew Mellor. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 51.65-57.62: Our US CEO Johnny Aitken in Denver, and our Group Chief Operating Officer Mark Hughes, who is joining us from Dublin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 58.36-66.65: Before we begin, please note all numbers referred to are unaudited and in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated. Turning to slide three. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 68.25-74.31: The December 2021 quarter, as well as the month of January, has been a period of great progress for PointsBet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 75.24-85.21: During the quarter we saw improvement in relation to many of our core financial metrics and we've also made great strides in terms of expanding our addressable market and delivering on our product vision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 86.17-89.53: This has been headlined by our exciting launch into New York this week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 90.01-97.60: New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States and we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators to gain access. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 98.62-104.70: This is in addition to our launch in Virginia last month and will be followed by our launch into Pennsylvania in February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 105.45-113.09: These are obviously very substantial markets and allow Pointsbet to leverage key NBC regional sports network assets in each market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 113.69-116.56: We also this week launched iGaming in West Virginia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 118.44-121.38: We will continue to grow our total addressable market rapidly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 121.40-130.27: Will Ontario, Canada likely to follow Pennsylvania? And at least a further seven states are expected to be added in North America in calendar year 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 131.71-140.82: In November, we were thrilled to deliver our first major in-play product upgrade following the acquisition of Bannock Technologies, now known as Pointsbet Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 141.84-146.37: Sports betting is the product that is leading the expansion of online betting across the USA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 147.33-153.55: To win market share and deliver success in the US market will require excellence in sports betting product and execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 154.63-163.64: As sports betting is legalized across the US, we anticipate that 75% of all online bets will be placed in play, that is, once a match has already started. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 164.99-168.53: Providing an elite optimized client experience in play betting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 168.55-177.62: Is beyond the capabilities of most operators who do not have modern in-house proprietary technology combined with advanced models and automated real-time trading systems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 178.26-183.70: US sports in particular continues to be poorly serviced in terms of the in-play client experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 185.04-192.09: PointsBet's superior optimized client experience, in particular around in-play, will clearly differentiate us from our opposition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 193.21-197.84: The PointsBit Europe upgrade has now been applied to NFL and recently NBA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 198.40-206.59: Further sports will swiftly follow. The impact on our NFL KPIs has been impressive and provides huge encouragement regarding the path we are on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 207.43-216.10: InPlay handle is up 44% since the upgrade and Group COO Mark Hughes will speak to other impressive positive indicators later in the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 217.28-225.61: It is also worth mentioning that this month Pointsbet became the first operator in the US to offer in-play betting with zero suspensions or 100% uptime. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 225.63-228.27: Across the core markets of NFL's spread and money line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 229.19-239.16: Most people would be unaware that the majority of operators are operating at just 70% of uptime, meaning that when a client attempts to place a bet, the market is suspended 30% of the time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 239.82-243.70: It's not hard to see the difference in player experience between the two outcomes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 243.80-250.17: And thus the positive sentiment and ultimately ongoing patronage that will be earned by the superior product experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 251.39-257.20: In addition to in-play betting, another key product battleground is parlays, and in particular same-game parlays. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 257.76-266.05: As such, it gives me great pride to announce that this week Pointsbet released its market-first NFL and NBA in-play or live same-game parlay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 267.13-270.29: PointsBit Same Game Parlor has proven incredibly popular with our clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 270.53-280.14: And providing them with the opportunity to place these bets during a game is a further example of how PointsBet is hitting its stride, leveraging the capabilities of our proprietary technology and models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 281.04-290.07: As you'll see in today's numbers, it's also great to see US net win increase 64% quarter on quarter to reflect the improvements we've made across the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 291.17-297.72: That improvement also includes iGaming. As is well recognized, PointsBet was late to the US market from an iGaming perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.28-301.54: We were not in New Jersey pre-PASPA repeal like many of our competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 301.90-309.13: And we took the time to build our own in-house proprietary platform as we set the business up the correct way for long-term success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.67-319.60: But we're now making swift ground. In November, we released the Evolution Live Casino product set into Michigan. And this was completed for New Jersey in January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 320.10-323.62: IGaming net win was up 145% quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 323.88-333.21: And with West Virginia having launched this week and Pennsylvania and Ontario upcoming, we will see iGaming revenues continue to climb on the back of our ever-improving product suite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 334.63-339.82: In Australia, the December quarter saw the seamless delivery of record activity across the spring carnival. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 340.50-348.07: It is imperative that we deliver a reliable, secure and scalable system that meets the needs of our clients on peak days such as Melbourne Cup Day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 349.01-355.34: On Caulfield Cup and Everest Day, Pointsbit Australia processed over 4,000 bets per minute, up 2.5 times on last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 355.88-360.94: On Melbourne Cup Day we processed over 683,000 bets for the day, setting a new record. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 362.26-369.13: This continues Pointsbet's impressive record of successfully managing peak days without incident in both Australia and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 370.21-372.71: To wrap up my introduction, I want to return to the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 373.27-380.44: In New Jersey, we've historically operated without the benefits of our gaming revenue and without the benefits of also being live in Pennsylvania. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 381.04-386.91: Many clients cross the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania and we're not using an app that is not operational in both markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 387.63-393.63: We have the Philadelphia Regional Sports Network via our relationship as the official sports betting partner of NBC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 394.41-402.58: This delivers us integration exclusivity for all 76ers, Phillies and Flyers games. An extremely powerful asset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 403.46-410.83: We've been utilizing this asset to reach the South Jersey audience, but will shortly be able to unlock its full benefits by being live in Pennsylvania. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 411.73-419.82: Following our New York launch earlier this week, we are now amongst an exclusive group of operators that will be live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 421.48-427.95: In New York, we are again leveraging our NBC partnership through SportsNetNY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 428.53-437.60: SNY is the regional broadcast home of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, in addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the NFL's New York Jets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 438.10-442.08: They offer point spec year round, multi-platform media and marketing opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 443.10-446.97: In parallel with these exciting developments, PointSpec continues to deliver on its product vision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 447.63-455.24: Recent months provide a taste of what is to come with market leading innovation as we now leverage the hard work that's gone into building our proprietary technology and product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 455.98-458.96: While it is disappointing to see the recent performance of our share price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 459.00-467.35: We continue to focus on achieving our key operational priorities, investing in our proprietary best-in-class technology and working towards our long-term growth goals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 468.41-472.51: We will now drill into particular focus areas. Slide four. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 473.93-479.62: Compared to the group results for Q2 FY 2021 to be referred to as the PCP,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 479.64-486.89: In Q2 FY22, sports birding turnover was up 11% at $1.33 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 487.47-497.08: Our sports betting gross win was up 60% at $133.8 million and sports betting group net win was up 61% at $71.9 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 498.00-504.60: Q2 FY22 iGaming net win of $5.4 million represented a 145% increase quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 505.93-507.09: Now turning to slide five. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 507.93-516.16: The Australian trading business continued its strong performance, ending the quarter with turnover of $727 million, up 34% compared to the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 516.62-520.78: Net winner 53.1 million up 7% from the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 521.34-529.35: However, net win was marginally lower than Q1 FY22, reflecting the business's focus on promotional activity during the spring carnival. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.99-535.32: Gross wind margin and net wind margin were 12.7% and 7.3% respectively. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 536.24-537.54: Now turning to slide six. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 538.58-542.86: Australian trading businesses Q2 marketing expense was $22.6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 542.88-550.31: Which assisted in delivering 12-month rolling cash active clients to 31 December of $232,875. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.33-552.93: An increase of 63% compared to the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 553.67-556.68: To take advantage of the latter parts of the NRL and AFL seasons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 556.70-558.22: The Spring Racing Carnival. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 558.26-566.81: The FY22 marketing budget was skewed towards H1 to build our brand and to acquire and retain clients over this important period of the sporting and racing calendar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 567.65-577.22: Marketing expense in H2 will be substantially lower than H1 as we execute this strategy to front-end marketing expense this financial year and leverage our fantastic Shaq assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 578.50-579.72: Now turning to slide seven. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.02-586.65: Compared to the PCP, the Australian trading business has seen improvement across several KPIs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 587.23-589.83: We saw a 15% growth of first-time bettors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 590.31-597.68: This was particularly pleasing given 2020 saw both AFL and NRL finals shift from September to October. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 597.70-600.82: Resulting in increased first-time better activity in the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 601.66-609.89: PointsBets app download volume grew by 121.3% compared to the PCP, representing the largest gain across all major competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.91-617.50: For context, sports bet increased volume by 34.5% and tab by 33.9% respectively compared to the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.10-620.58: And Pointspot's brand awareness grew significantly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 621.80-629.61: As mentioned earlier, I'm also very pleased to report that our in-house proprietary system successfully processed record betting activity through the Spring Racing Carnival. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 630.21-635.52: We saw new peaks reach for scale indicators such as bets per minute, concurrent active user sessions and settlements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.60-646.51: Success on such big days in Australia provides the global team with even more confidence in the stability and scalability of our tech stack and trading systems as we enter into the NFL Finals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.53-648.43: And launching more US states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 649.33-653.53: Now hand over to US CEO, Johnny Aitken to provide commentary on our US business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 656.78-663.36: Turning to slide eight, in leading off, I wanted to say that we are pleased with the trade during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 664.20-665.99: As communicated in January. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 666.03-673.27: The December 2020 quarter for handle, gross win and net win results was impacted by short-term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 673.29-677.30: By trading variances, which reversed in January of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 677.44-681.80: And as such, the PCP comparison growth rate should be viewed with this in mind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 682.54-690.39: Pleasingly, Q2 net win of $24.1 million represented quarter-on-quarter growth of 64%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 691.39-697.54: We remain focused on generating net win in our US business and doing so in a sustainable and disciplined fashion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 698.64-704.32: Please refer to Appendix 1 of the presentation for a state-by-state breakdown of Handle, Gross Wind and Net Wind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 706.17-711.67: Handle for the quarter was $598.9 million, up 72% quarter on quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.43-719.12: Handel shows a decline on PCP, but please note my earlier comments on the impact of last year's short-term trading variances. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 720.26-723.48: I'd like to take a moment here to outline a very important part of our strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 724.42-730.97: We are extremely focused on ensuring that every dollar of handle we book will ultimately drive value and revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 732.23-739.02: In line with this, our focus is aimed at ensuring every client we acquire is capable of being revenue generating. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 740.16-749.37: Rather than focusing on the sheer number of actives, our experienced customer intelligence and trading analytics teams are intensely focused on calculating the lifetime value of our clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.35-752.61: Ensuring they are accurately and quickly profiled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 753.51-758.06: Targeting, procuring and retaining the right clients continues to be very important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 759.14-763.86: PointsBets blended US online handle market share in the States we are operational in.

asr:0: OUTPUT 772.89-775.98: A further breakdown of market share first date can be found on slide A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 777.00-781.70: Cost handle is one indicator of business scale. We remain focused on growing that win. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 782.62-788.85: Our strong sense is that analysts and operators agree that the market will transition from being heavily. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 788.87-794.29: Are promotional driven to one where the product experience is the primary driver of operator success. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 795.18-797.12: Environment scale for distribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 797.64-800.58: And we certainly have the latter via our partnership with MBT. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 801.88-806.01: I note the heightened gross wind margin that PointsBet has delivered in New Jersey compared to all other states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 806.95-812.67: This is partly due to variance, but it's also being driven by the more advanced life cycle of the New Jersey market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 813.07-822.96: As customers adopt more diverse products such as parlays and player props away from the traditional lower pre-game margin spreads, totals and money line bets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.84-831.57: This is an encouraging forward-looking trend that plays to PointSpec's innovation strengths, controlled by our proprietary tech and internal trading models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.41-841.80: Our quick Parlay Builder, Parlay Booster, Same Game Parlay and now in-game Same Game Parlay are just the beginning of ongoing product feature enhancement.

asr:0: OUTPUT 846.35-850.35: Marketing expenses were $29.7 million US dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 850.49-857.06: And I'm pleased to report that the overall US working media cost per per FDB was again under $500. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 858.22-861.56: We continue to invest in marketing and growing the brand across the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 862.42-868.51: Cash Actives grew to $211,000, up 210% compared to the PCP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 869.45-875.80: It should be noted that this metric also reflects our retention efforts, not just acquisition volumes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 877.12-883.68: Further, a sizable portion of this quarter's marketing investment was into audiences outside of what was eight live states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 884.82-887.93: This investment targeted upcoming states like Virginia,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 887.95-896.00: New York and Pennsylvania, and more broadly, acts to build brand awareness in the database nationally to assist future state launches. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 897.54-904.04: We noted in the FY22 Q1 call that there was an opportunity to better utilize our tactical promotion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 904.92-907.35: A number of optimizations were made during Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 907.69-915.12: Refining our approach with a focus on rewarding our high value engaged client cohort and gaining an improved share of wallet from them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 916.08-922.26: We reinvested a smaller proportion of gross gaming revenue on promotions in Q2 compared to Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.62-931.75: While slightly lower than the peak seen in September and October, competition remains significant in the quarter, specifically as it related to promotional activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 932.31-936.42: Thus, it was important to retain and incentivize our valued clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 936.44-943.20: With all four major pro sports together being active along with college basketball and college football. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 943.80-952.37: However, it should be noted that we expect to gradually bring down the rate of promotional investment further in time as we continue to focus and lead with our superior product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 953.87-954.91: Turning to slide 11. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 956.48-958.92: We are excited by the opportunity before us this calendar year.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1002.20-1004.00: Ellen Arbison. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.02-1009.43: Appointed brand ambassador, our Virginia launch exceeded our execution goals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1010.37-1019.90: In the first week of launch, Virginia FTBs acquired by NBC channels were almost five times higher than FTBs acquired in the first week post-launch. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1019.92-1021.54: In the state of Michigan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1022.66-1031.29: This launch demonstrated that we continue to improve our strategic go-to-market plans that are leveraging our NBC partnership and execution capabilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1032.47-1041.00: Viewers have been familiar with the PointsBed brand through our exclusive odds integrations and expert analysis during key NBC television broadcasts.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1074.47-1083.50: So utilizing NBC's regional sports networks and owned and operated broadcast stations unlocks a daily presence with local market teams. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1083.52-1085.13: And top sporting events. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1085.61-1086.97: Grading system.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1881.38-1890.85: As earlier presented by Johnny, this strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an accretive and valuable partnership for the company, but not indicative of a larger B2B strategy of points-back.

asr:0: OUTPUT 1986.93-1993.17: The main driver of this outflow was the well-documented market access payment to the New York State Gaming Commission.

asr:0: OUTPUT 2106.75-2114.45: If you wish to cancel your request, please press star 2. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2115.74-2121.28: Your first question comes from Rohan Sundaram from MST Financial. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2123.22-2126.39: Hi team, might start with a question for Sam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2126.51-2135.54: How are you thinking about the long-term share aspirations of the business in light of the ongoing increases in estimated North America terms? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2135.56-2143.96: Would you be happy with say a 5% share of a 70 billion dollar market as opposed to say 10% of a 30 billion dollar market? Is that how you're thinking about it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.39-2151.33: I think our aspiration remains to afford that 10% market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2152.33-2157.94: I think the reality is what we thought in terms of a marketing budget that would allow us to achieve that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2157.98-2165.55: Is now effectively probably a marketing budget that's more akin to achieving a say a 3 or 4% market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.57-2173.77: As you've sort of drawn the link to, the size of the market has grown dramatically and the estimated size of the future market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2174.39-2182.64: So our competitors are being far more aggressive in line with that and they're being far more aggressive from a promotional perspective. So, you know, I suppose our relative budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2182.82-2188.65: If you think about us spending $27 last quarter and a little bit more this quarter,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2189.51-2198.28: The market was probably spending close to a billion dollars on those two borders on marketing. So we're probably spending about 3% of what the market's spending for marketing. So it's a bit unrealistic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2198.30-2205.31: For us to expect at this stage in the current environment to be heading rapidly north towards that 10%. But as. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2205.35-2215.30: I suppose as we assume the market transitions, it was interesting hearing Adam, the CEO of MGM yesterday or the day before, talk about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2216.02-2225.93: Maybe there's another 12 months of this heightened aggressiveness in the market, maybe one more start of NFL season, but then their expectation is that perhaps things ease off a little bit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2226.81-2228.73: And we probably agree with that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2229.17-2235.32: And in line with that, obviously we're continuing to make rapid progress on our product strategy. So we think those two things combined. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2235.80-2239.34: Improving our brand, we're investing in our brand, we're investing in building databases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.00-2242.46: While it may take longer to get to that 10%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2242.48-2250.49: Given the growing TAM and the amount that's being spent, but we still plan to get there as the market transitions to be more product focused. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2252.89-2260.94: And. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2261.34-2266.83: How would you share a look on a net win basis, especially given the first quarter was almost 8% net win? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2268.31-2277.34: Yeah, well I mean, New Jersey is a very good example. So, you know, from a market share perspective, we came under a bit of pressure again, but from a net win perspective, net win quarter on quarter was up 24%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2278.46-2282.14: So that's a good example. We want to keep growing NetWin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2282.58-2292.17: If that's a smaller portion of the market than we thought would be, that's in some ways a positive because again it talks to the fact that the market is bigger than most expected and is growing more rapidly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2292.91-2294.95: Johnny made a comment during... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2295.68-2303.72: His part about the fact that New Jersey now it's becoming a bit of a trend that its gross margin yields are yielding higher than our other states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2304.30-2306.27: We look at the reason behind that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2306.43-2323.14: As he said, some of it's some variance, but some of it is definitely some differences in player behavior in terms of that slightly more mature market now because it's been open a bit longer. Players gravitating to the higher margin products, the same game parlays, the player props, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2323.16-2325.47: Again, that's a positive trend for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2325.81-2333.49: Because it shows that they're moving into the, let's call it the sweet spot for points bet because this is where we aim to lead in terms of having the most engaging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2333.51-2337.18: Products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2340.74-2345.87: Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Stout from SIG. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2347.69-2356.70: Good morning, everyone. Sam, you talked about New Jersey, Indiana, and Michigan, where the states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2356.86-2362.58: The bigger states that you have exposure to in the third quarter we lost share but uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2362.84-2383.52: I guess the expectation, rightfully or wrongfully, is it would take a while to build those back given the advertising and the promotional environment. But you were able to rebuild in Michigan. I was wondering, can you describe or talk about maybe some of the methods that you used to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2383.54-2388.27: To recapture some of that last year in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2388.29-2390.49: Fiscal second quarter versus the first quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2390.67-2397.38: That's the first question. And then I wanted to ask about customer acquisition costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2397.76-2404.14: Johnny, you had mentioned you guys are still running about $500 or so. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2404.38-2410.49: And with your newer lawn states in Virginia,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.51-2420.10: And then in a month or in february and new york and your ability to rely on your rss and your mvc rss,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2420.62-2428.29: Would it be fair to assume that customer acquisition costs could come down in those particular markets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2429.99-2438.54: Hi Joe. So in terms of Michigan, look again, I think the pleasing thing for Michigan, yes, our sports betting market share did go up, but again, even more importantly,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2439.00-2444.08: I think we had $700,000 of net win last quarter and this quarter was something like $3.2 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2444.16-2448.65: So again, really good growth in Michigan from a net win perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2450.11-2453.95: I think obviously when you've got the casino products improving. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.14-2459.14: When we think about states that have a mix of sports betting and iGaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2459.46-2461.54: You really do have to look at them in totality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.64-2463.72: Because it goes without saying that if a client... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2463.74-2478.52: Goes and loses some money playing blackjack, well then that's perhaps less money that they have to turn over on sports betting. So the two are genuinely related and that's when you're looking at New Jersey, Michigan and soon to be West Virginia and Pennsylvania and states with mixed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2478.54-2480.74: You have to look at the combined results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2483.34-2487.83: Difference if you just have sports betting to having sports betting and iGaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2488.39-2491.59: Johnny, is there anything you'd want to say about Michigan in particular? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2493.67-2502.04: I'll just add, Sam, that again, we view every state as a state of its own, not country, and each state sort of differs in terms of the dynamic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2502.88-2510.01: And how consumers consume sport, the population, the distribution. A market like Michigan is very unique. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.43-2518.40: In that particular, we're seeing the early results of a very smart investment with a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2518.42-2523.90: So they own the arena where the Pistons and the Red Wings play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2524.14-2527.57: We made a smart investment into building a sports bar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2527.91-2537.36: Next to the main entrance of the stadium and when you've got at least 82 home games of NBA, NHL and people are walking past the points that brand going in and out of the arena and going there and having a drink. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2537.78-2547.25: It's played a role in making sure the points bet's part of the local sporting fabric there and part of the consideration when people in Michigan and Detroit are thinking about where to place their next bet or sign up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2548.71-2551.35: Thanks John. In terms of the CAC Joe, I mean. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2551.59-2560.06: We spent $29.7 million on marketing and last quarter was similar in terms of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2561.12-2564.18: Because we were waiting to launch in Virginia,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2564.40-2567.39: And we knew that we had upcoming launches and we were waiting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2567.51-2574.49: Quietly confident of a positive outcome in New York and again confident of a positive outcome with licensing in Pennsylvania. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2574.93-2584.52: It's been a strange couple of quarters because a fair chunk of our marketing budget has gone into the Washington RNC and the Philly RSN and SNY in New York. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2585.07-2589.69: So as those states go live, Virginia, now New York, and soon Pennsylvania. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2590.13-2595.68: That spend goes from being sort of out of state to being in live states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2595.72-2605.19: And so that proportion of, let's call it somewhat of spend that was going outside and maybe less efficient, yes, it was building the brand and warming those states up. That then comes in state. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2605.71-2614.53: I wouldn't necessarily say that tax is going to come down because we're now going live into those states. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2614.57-2621.12: But we certainly do believe that those, it's the model that we've used obviously in Chicago that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2621.34-2628.25: We're never going to outspend these big guys at the moment but the audience watches live sport. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2628.39-2635.60: We've got Philly 76ers, all the teams that Johnny spoke about, the Mets in New York, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2636.16-2643.74: Getting in front of those eyeballs through those RSNs we think is a very efficient mechanism to grow our brand and acquire clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2650.91-2655.88: Thank you. Your next question comes from Desmond Starr from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2658.78-2666.99: I've just got a couple of questions around slide 14 and 15. I think you guys provided some interesting details. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2667.79-2669.01: On those two slides. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2669.27-2678.00: Obviously, I think Mark noted a couple of industry first achievements by the business in the US and obviously now with BANIC and the rise of InPlay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2678.70-2687.71: I was wondering if you could just talk a bit more about the opportunity that InPlay presents and then more specifically, whether you have a sense of market share within InPlay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2688.45-2696.16: And would it be fair to say that your share of the in-play market is actually far greater than the blended 4.2% share that you talked to today? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2698.20-2699.20: Good question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2700.40-2709.51: I think in terms of the opportunity, I really want this to be clear in terms of stepping through the dynamics of the US market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.69-2715.92: We've been at a disadvantage because we didn't come from an iGaming background. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2716.02-2722.44: Most of the companies that we're competing against, New Jersey legalized iGaming back in something like 2013. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2723.34-2731.93: So most of our competitors have been operating iGaming in America in one state at least and maturing all of their products and practices for some time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2732.15-2733.65: Pre-PASPA being repealed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2734.55-2740.68: Add to that, as I said, the fact that we took the time to build our own platform because we want it, we want to own it, we want to keep the margin for the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2741.06-2750.89: We have been at a competitive disadvantage from a product set perspective but also from a revenue perspective of not having had that product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2751.29-2760.42: But as we think about forward-looking states, I think it needs to be clear that all the states that are going live now and launching are all sports betting only. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2760.84-2768.11: So iGaming expertise is not going to necessarily get you anywhere if you don't have sports betting expertise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2768.13-2772.37: Obviously our blueprint is to win our market share on the back of our sports betting expertise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2772.79-2777.78: And then when iGaming does get legalized, you know, two years later or three years later for a particular state,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2778.20-2784.00: We've already got hundreds of thousands of clients and we can cross sell 40% of them or whatever that number is to iGaming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2784.38-2788.23: Versus someone who is focused on iGaming, well, they won't have any market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2788.59-2790.43: They don't have protracted sports betting product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2790.99-2793.35: They're not going to win that market share in those sports betting sites. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2793.79-2797.80: But within that earning of market share from sports betting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2798.20-2804.88: I don't think there's any operators out there that aren't talking about a 75% in-play market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2805.61-2809.79: So everyone's agreeing that 75% of sports bets will be placed in play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2810.27-2817.32: We're on a path to leading within that sector. We want to lead within the entire product sector. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2817.40-2821.72: So we want to have the best product full stop and that includes improving our gaming product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2822.66-2826.25: But leading the way and now starting to deliver on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2826.27-2827.39: Some of our product vision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2827.85-2833.63: Part of the challenge when you build something from scratch, we built this tech stack from scratch even in Australia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2834.07-2838.22: And at the start, we know a lot of resources, is it takes time to deliver things. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2839.04-2842.62: We're now getting to the point where we're delivering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2842.68-2846.51: We're starting to innovate as 100% uptime in play. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2846.53-2856.68: In-play same-game parlay, etc. So when it comes to the in-play vision and how important it's going to be for winning market share and ultimately succeeding in the US, I don't think anyone's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2856.70-2858.64: In doubt with us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2858.78-2862.70: I hope the market is starting to see our points bet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2863.60-2869.25: He's already leading in this category, but he's going to put the foot down and continue to really put a gap on there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2870.05-2877.04: In terms of in-play market share, I'll throw to Johnny, but I would just say,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2877.10-2884.46: Perhaps, I think it's still a customer journey and that's what we're talking about from the New Jersey perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2884.50-2885.67: Yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2885.85-2888.87: The market is still very focused on the promos, etc. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2889.09-2892.27: It will gradually gravitate to be more product focused. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2892.65-2899.98: And then there's the second part to that is though, as clients get a little bit more sophisticated, as we're seeing in New Jersey, and they branch away from the core bet types. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2900.36-2909.27: Into more creative bet types and higher margin bet types. But Johnny, do you have a feel for whether you believe we're already over indexing from an in-play perspective? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2911.87-2917.78: I think the true read through will be Q3 and onwards this quarter and onwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2918.60-2921.10: And the reason being there that again in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2921.12-2928.99: We saw NFL and NBA move on to our internal trading feeds powered by the Bannick technology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2929.15-2933.27: And so now sort of for each quarter ahead, we'll get a true rate of the power that drives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2933.49-2939.70: One of the things I think is misunderstood by the market is that it isn't just about competing for employee on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2940.00-2941.38: The number of markets you have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2942.02-2944.68: It isn't just about building player pops and micro markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2945.35-2948.69: Really the core tenet of offering an in-play experience that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2948.71-2955.46: Drives repeat usage and allows you to lean in on your product over again, sort of covering. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.82-2958.26: Maybe with gaps in the product with heavier sort of promotions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2959.04-2960.94: Tend to be around being out the longest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2961.08-2968.63: Again, you know, sort of aiming towards that zero sort of betting suspensions and giving consumers that complete experience to place a bet, to cash out their bet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2968.83-2974.35: Without again, you know, the moment when the democracists are suspended. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2974.77-2978.70: And then the second tenant is around the speed to accept the bet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2978.80-2986.27: Again, we note that our competition in general applies 7-10 second bet delay when any in-play bet is placed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2986.93-2995.36: And then after that seven and 10 seconds passes and the bet is then pinged again to the trading software that's being used externally by a lot of our competitors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2996.02-3001.04: 50% of the time the bets are rejected due to a price change or again, due to the market being suspended. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3001.62-3005.91: Again, we're actively working and backing the models. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3005.93-3016.10: That have been delivered by Bannick, backing in the pricing efficiency that we have, that we have the confidence to continue to put as many clients as we can on zero-bet delay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3016.12-3023.94: So not only matching that uptime goal, but continue to increase that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3024.02-3025.49: But also accepting bets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3026.33-3029.49: In a lightning spade. If we're up the longest, then Quigley gets to accept. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3029.91-3038.18: We think that combined with our product features and the distribution of the message of PointsBet being the king of in-play, particularly across the NBC platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3038.26-3041.70: Again, it's going to be a huge ongoing driver of client activity for the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3044.08-3046.73: Right. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Johnny. Appreciate it. That's all for me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3050.43-3055.70: Your next question comes from Larry Gandler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3057.56-3059.28: I think a few questions from me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3059.88-3069.57: Sam, just in New Jersey, hearing how you guys evolved the management of that offering there,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3070.97-3078.86: Can you talk to whether that involved a churn of customers or did you migrate existing customers into new patterns? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3080.08-3089.69: How'd that play out? And is this a sort of first date? How come you didn't sort of take this approach in Illinois yet? Is it just a different circumstance there? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3091.33-3092.87: G'day Larry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3092.89-3098.00: I think across the business, we made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3098.04-3109.49: Comment and I think Johnny referenced it again that last quarter we probably didn't focus enough on our existing clients or our higher quality clients and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3109.61-3114.65: With our promotions and focused on the acquisition period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3115.06-3119.34: I think we do want to focus on quality clients. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3119.68-3127.73: Without wanting to, everyone's got their own strategies but acquiring clients is not hard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3128.03-3137.44: We can run promotions and give away money and just acquire clients but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of those clients are going to be of value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3137.56-3145.29: We're trying to find the balance and I think that's the message coming out that yes, we will keep growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3145.71-3148.37: But we want to keep growing responsibly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3149.31-3154.21: So if adding another 10,000 actives or 20,000 actives, if those actives are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3154.23-3161.92: Are no good and that's the same in terms of churn. There's no point trying to hold on to some clients if they're just genuinely not genuine. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3163.38-3166.85: Then we make no apologies for doing that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3166.89-3175.78: So no, I wouldn't say that we're actively targeting segments or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3175.80-3179.98: Disconnecting from certain segments apart from unprofitable segments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3180.00-3181.82: Clients that are just not going to be worth anything. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3182.44-3184.44: And in terms of Illinois, no, it's very similar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3185.57-3191.27: It's very similar, the strategy is the same. It's about a focus on value, continue to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3191.63-3199.72: It's just the dynamics work out that in New Jersey, we grew revenue by that 24% quarter on quarter, lost a bit of market share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3200.10-3204.66: I mean, in Illinois, we're able to continue growth without losing that market share, but the strategy is consistent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3207.09-3215.22: Okay, excellent there. And with New Jersey, just continuing on that, I think you did about 15 million of net win in the half. Let's. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3215.24-3217.36: Say we annualize that a bit more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3218.54-3226.87: New Jersey has been funding marketing for new states, but if we kind of withdraw that new state support. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3228.11-3234.55: Are we getting close to break even in New Jersey alone if you sort of isolate just New Jersey marketing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3235.98-3243.80: Yeah, I think we are, Larry. I mean, I think, would we do 10.8 for the quarter? I would rather times that by four. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3243.84-3249.93: Because the iGaming product has come in and that wasn't necessarily present in previous quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3250.95-3255.32: There's a lot happening in New Jersey. There's a lot of market dynamics still there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3255.64-3257.08: So I'll call out a few. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3257.26-3259.80: Obviously going live in New York and being. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3259.82-3269.09: One of the exclusive group that will be live in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will be helpful going live in Pennsylvania. We spoke to that Philly audience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3269.51-3274.15: Continued growth of the iGaming product is going to be vitally important. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3274.43-3282.04: But I think by the middle of next year, we think New Jersey is turning profitable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3282.66-3288.29: Post the cessation of sports, sport came back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3288.53-3293.43: Middle of post-COVID in the middle of 2020, sort of had to restart the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3293.87-3299.62: And so, you know, we think by the end of next financial year, we're turning profitable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3303.76-3309.27: Thank you. Your next question comes from Don Carducci from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3312.49-3319.70: So just a couple quick ones for me. So if I think about the net new active customers, where did they come from? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3319.88-3323.86: Was it the new markets or was it maybe those markets that you had been in for 12 months or more? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3326.05-3335.58: We acquire clients in all new markets. The difference being that in a market like New Jersey where you have been live for some time,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3335.72-3338.88: You also churn clients out the back end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3338.90-3342.12: The increase in active clients is a net effect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3342.38-3351.39: What you've added. Obviously the increase we've acquired more first-time bettors than that increase in actives, but we've also churned some clients in the back end. So that's the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3351.41-3352.95: That's the net effect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3354.29-3356.22: Yeah, no, got it. I understand that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3356.64-3358.74: If I rephrase the question, I mean, you have churn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3359.30-3366.67: Is the majority of this churn coming from new states or is it coming from the existing states that you've been in for 12 months or more like New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3367.47-3375.76: Yeah, by the definition, because we're giving a 12-month rolling number, it has to be states that we've been live in for more than 12 months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3375.98-3383.40: Because if we've been live in a state for six months, for example, all of those clients would be in the 12-month active number. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3384.86-3389.03: Gotcha. And then can you give us a little bit of clarity on the cash firm guidance maybe for next quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3389.59-3398.14: Include license payments, et cetera. Obviously, Pennsylvania, that's a steep one, New Jersey, but just a little bit of guidance on what we should expect for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3399.68-3400.74: Yeah, sure don't, Sandy.
