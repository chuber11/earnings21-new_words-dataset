asr:0: OUTPUT 1287.61-1292.41: At similar levels to the ones we have been discussing. Okay, let's recall. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1292.53-1301.02: What we have mentioned in prior calls about having a long-term trajectory on Ticket at around 12%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.12-1307.31: Okay, 12% plus, that is higher in around 50 basis points we will discuss pre-pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1307.93-1315.00: With regards to structural cost, what we have said is that the structural cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.02-1318.22: Should actually benefit from, let's say,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1318.24-1325.05: Around 60% operating leverage, meaning that if orders were to grow around 100%,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.29-1329.41: Okay, structural costs should be growing no more than 40%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.39-1340.26: And that, I would say, points to a picture on what could be the profitability of the company going forward, that it should be in excess of what we were discussing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1340.44-1341.94: In pre-pandemic in the long run. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1344.94-1353.17: Got it. And maybe one other follow-up. You indicated you're looking to kind of rebuild inventory for packages given some of the demand signals you're seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1353.93-1362.36: I guess how quickly can that happen and do you expect that you'll be able to have enough kind of capacity for the peak travel seasons? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1364.40-1370.35: We currently see a, I think that answer has maybe two different ideas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1370.85-1383.34: Number one is the company continues to be, let's say, on the sidelines when it comes to, let's say, securing inventory as we have done pre-pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.38-1399.98: Okay, remember that we were actually at around, let's say, 5%, between 5% to 10%, no more than that, of all the gross bookings we're selling were actually secured or paid in advance on capacity at hotels and or airlines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1401.06-1402.38: The pandemic struck. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1402.40-1413.07: We were completely on the sidelines of that and we are not thinking about starting to push into that arena as of, let's say, the next few quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1413.49-1422.72: And we do not see a reason to do it given, number one, the ups and downs of the business, and number two, we see capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.94-1424.34: So there's no need to do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.39-1435.00: Of course, we see that as a profitable business and that will put our foot on the gas pedal. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1435.10-1440.74: As they we are fully recovered because we see there's there's opportunity to gain extra margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.80-1444.86: But for the time being, we will not do it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1445.15-1453.49: In general inventory, what we are seeing is that airlines are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1453.51-1458.92: Increasing their networks significantly in Latin America for the upcoming two to three months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.26-1469.17: So everything that's available from the airlines and the hotel is going to be in Despegar and we are seeing increased levels of impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1469.63-1475.94: On both areas. So we are confident that the pace of the recovery will be sustained over the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1478.10-1486.51: Thanks so much. And ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.11-1492.01: Our next question comes from Kevin Koppelman with Cowan & Company. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1494.57-1498.28: Good morning. This is Emily on for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1499.80-1505.09: You mentioned a new marketing campaign launching in Q4 focused on affordability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1505.67-1515.18: I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that will affect revenue take rate installments and sales and marketing expenses in the quarter. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1516.74-1526.23: Hi Emily, thanks for your question. This is Damian. The new campaign was extremely effective, it's been extremely effective, it's still running. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1526.69-1531.49: And what we are pointing towards is getting back to travel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.51-1539.26: And being able to afford the travel as we always have been positioned in the minds of consumers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.52-1545.49: We do not expect that these will represent or be reflected in any lower take rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.93-1553.71: Remember that as we mentioned during the previous remarks, we have enhanced significantly our revenue management capabilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.17-1559.88: So we are being much more effective in the past in increasing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1559.90-1564.78: Demand without having to give up significantly on the tech grid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1565.53-1574.13: So the numbers that Alberto referred to in the previous question should be sustained over the next few months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1577.78-1578.96: Very clear, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1584.60-1590.91: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for the final remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1594.77-1601.38: Thank you very much. Just wanted to thank all of you for your participation and interest in Despegado. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.58-1609.35: We hope you all remain healthy and safe, and thanks for joining us today. Looking forward to seeing you on our next call. Bye. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.65-1619.48: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day. 
asr:0: END
