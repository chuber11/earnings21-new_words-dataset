asr:0: OUTPUT 131.95-135.08: Despite the ongoing challenges created by COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.18-143.08: Our focus on cost control along with a strengthening child market last year, so stable cash generation and improve profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.20-152.13: We repurchased another six millions of our preference units in the open market, bringing the total repurchased in 2021 to 18 millions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 152.65-159.76: And finally, we retired another $17 million of debt during the quarter, bringing the total to $108 million for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 162.38-167.15: Turning to slide 5 and a summary of our financial performance in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 169.27-172.53: As you can see from the charts on this slide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.65-183.34: Reach out to the core of our vessels on effective terms along with our strategy of reducing our debt, enleveling our cost base, improve our profitability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 184.92-192.51: Despite a 2% decline in revenue last year relative to 2020, our profitability increased 8%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 194.25-204.74: As noted on our last call, our capital allocation for 2022 will continue to focus on net repayment and reducing the breakeven rates of off-leads will improve its cash flow capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 208.09-213.33: Turning to slide six, which summarizes our operational upside to the strong shipping market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 215.96-221.00: As you can see from the chart on the left, the partnership has a balanced charter portfolio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 222.10-228.65: Our fixed shelter coverage, shown in dark blue, more than covers our fixed expanses through at least 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 230.79-236.82: Meanwhile, our open days shown in light gray display a significant leverage to the tight shipping market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 237.78-242.92: You'll note we also have one vessel on spot market link contact, which will also benefit from higher spot rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 244.40-248.57: Our chartering team did a great job in fixing through the seasonal lows of quarter one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 249.51-254.11: The majority of our open dates for 2022 are in the seasonally strong period of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 254.47-262.64: And if it's $10,000 per day of revenue earned above our operating and overhead expenses, we'll generate an incremental $30 million of EBITDA for the partnership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 265.85-270.29: With that, I'll hand over to Achilles to take you through the partnership quota for financials. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 272.09-278.30: Thank you, Paolo. Turning to slide 8 and the partnerships financial results for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 278.98-289.53: As Paolo mentioned earlier, our financial performance in Q4 2021 improved significantly from both the third quarter of 2021 as well as fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 290.33-297.82: Specifically, revenues for the fourth quarter were $88 million, a 4% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.64-306.51: The revenue improved year over year is primarily due to the four new term charter agreements that we signed in the second half of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 307.47-316.94: Adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, an increase of 9% from the fourth quarter of 2020, while adjusted earnings was $0.45 per unit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 317.84-324.48: The significant improvements in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS were aided by the improved revenue performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.50-327.65: Our ongoing cost and role initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 327.67-338.44: And in addition, in terms of EPS, the lower interest expenses due to declining debt balances and the preference shares buyback that reduce the preference shares distributions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 339.58-348.27: Looking forward, the partnership has charter coverage of 100% in the first quarter of 2020 and 76% charter coverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.29-349.85: For all of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 350.49-355.92: In addition, we have no scheduled dry docking this year, which provides good cash flow visibility. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 358.26-361.48: Turning to slide 9 and a look at our course base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 362.84-371.17: Our overhead expenses for 2021 were approximately in line with our averages for the full year and the guidance we gave on our last call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 373.35-374.41: He looked over to the other side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 374.89-381.18: We expect our unit operating expenses to average $13,700 per vessel per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 381.52-387.01: While we expect our overhead expenses to average $3,200 per vessel per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 388.31-399.96: The significant decline in our operating expenses for 2022 is due to a reduction in the management fee we will be paying to our parent gas locality effective on January 1st, 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.50-402.88: As well as no dry adulting expenses for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 404.46-415.12: The slower operating costs are offset by higher overhead expenses primarily related to an increase in the administrative service fee to Gasloc Ltd. Effective from January 1st, 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 415.52-421.60: As well as direct public company expenses which were previously shared between Gaslocalty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 423.06-429.83: Public company expenditures are now borne by the partnership alone, following our parents' take private transaction last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 431.43-436.26: Our overall cost base has been declining significantly over the last several years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.36-445.93: Specifically, our unit topics declined by 9% since 2019, and our unit DNA declined by 10% as compared with our 2022 guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 446.85-454.25: Fully absorbing all the one of course associated with COVID related disruption and the changes in the gaslock group mentioned above. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 455.42-460.56: As we have previously stated, we continue to look for ways to reduce our cost base further. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 463.78-473.05: Slide 10 shows the partnerships debt balances and balance sheet metrics as well as the progress we have made towards our leveraged targets in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 474.35-482.42: The partnership's balance sheet remains robust. The partnership ended the fourth quarter with $146 million of cash-in-cash equivalents. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 483.88-490.21: Our capital allocation priorities since 2020 have focused on reducing our leverage and cost base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 491.11-497.10: Last quarter, we presented our target leverage metrics, which you can find on the left side of this slide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 497.96-512.19: I'm pleased to say that we have made progress towards these goals in 2021, despite the non-cash impairment charge of 104 million we took in the fourth quarter related to our five steam turbine LNG carriers Bukvayus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 513.27-525.11: Specifically, we retired approximately $108 million of debt during 2021, which reduced our debt to total capitalization to 54% from 56% in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 525.41-529.07: When combined with our 146 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.41-536.84: Our net debt to capitalization has been reduced to 47% by the end of the fourth quarter, from 51% at the end of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 537.56-544.28: In addition, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA has declined to 4.3 times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 545.95-555.48: We expect to continue strengthening our balance sheet, beginning with a scheduled retirement of approximately $114 million of debt and lease liabilities in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 555.50-559.16: Which is covered by our contracted cash flow over this period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 559.86-567.09: Reducing debt balances will reduce the partnership's cash flow break-even levels over time, improving further the competitiveness of our fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 568.47-577.66: We believe that prioritizing debt reduction supports the partnership's future growth in equity value and enhances the overall shareholder's value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 580.34-588.71: Slide 11, discussing the partnerships preference unit repurchase program, which supports our strategic effort to reduce our cost base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 591.75-600.28: During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a total of approximately 6 million of our Series B and Series C preference units in the open market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.30-604.97: Bringing our total for 2021 to approximately 18 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 605.73-611.37: Our purchases to date were at an average price of $25 per unit, which is their par value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 612.51-619.04: These repurchases reduce preference unit distributions by approximately 1.5 million on an annual basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 620.00-625.77: We expect to continue opportunistically the purchase preference units in the open market as positions dictate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 627.07-632.61: With that, I will turn it over to Paolo to discuss the LNG commodity and LNG shipping market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 634.21-637.94: Thank you, Achille. Turning now to Slide 13. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 640.16-645.41: Voting registered 44 term charters greater than six months in quarter for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 646.43-651.19: Helping to set a new annual record of 165 term shelters for 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 652.65-660.68: The high level of term charging observed last year was in response to strong energy demand, toll mile growth, and logistical bottlenecks around the world. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 661.62-672.67: This dynamic along a wide arbitrage for delivering energy to Asia from the United States during much of 2021 led our customers and others to seek term coverage and security of shipping capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 674.15-677.98: On the right chart, you'll know that headline spot rates have declined in recent weeks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 678.94-688.35: Although headland spot rates have inflected lower, now around 28,500 per day, it isn't unusual for spot rates to decline as we approach the end of the northern hemisphere winter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 689.61-699.28: Despite the decline in spot rates, term rates are relatively firm, as the one-year time chart rate is currently assessed at $87,000 per day, according to Clarkson. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 701.36-705.39: This is indicative of charterers' expectations for a tight market in the months ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 706.57-711.83: In addition, the forward curve for energy spot rate indicates rising rates through the rest of 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 713.53-718.70: As a result of these fundamental drivers and frictional challenges, we expect the energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 718.72-724.40: Spot market to continue to perform strongly through next winter, as I'll discuss over the next several slides. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 727.23-733.29: Slide 14 presents LNG demand and supply during quarter 4 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 735.50-744.99: Energy demand increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, according to PODEN, as shown by the left-hand figure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 746.39-748.65: The man from Europe was strong in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 749.59-756.14: A combination of over-reliance on renewables, low storage inventory, and lower than anticipated imports from Russia and Norway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 756.16-765.83: Push demand for LNG, resulting in record high prices in the region, underscoring the need for natural gas and LNG as a transition fuel in the evolving energy landscape. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.27-781.54: On the supply side, U.S. Production rose by over 28 year-on-year to 19 million tons due to less unplanned downtime and the ramp-up in production from the third train at Seaport, Cameron, and Copos-Christie LNG facilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 783.22-790.19: This continues the theme we witnessed throughout 2021, US production increases met global demand growth for natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 791.89-799.80: The shipping-tensive nature of US supplies relative to end-user in Asia and Europe has propelled home-buyer growth up to 16% in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.84-802.60: More than twice that's the demand of the commodity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 804.94-811.05: Slide 15 shows significant cost increases for natural gas in Asia and Europe since Q4 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 812.79-822.24: The past few months have highlighted the dangers of lack of infrastructure investment in gas, which we can observe by noting the record high energy prices in Asia and Europe shown on this figure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 823.68-830.45: In recognition of these energy qualities, the European Commission is now considering adding gas and nuclear power to the green taxonomy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 831.65-838.86: This would accomplish the goal of reducing emission from the generation of electricity while also securing steady and competitive supply of energy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.24-849.99: LNG is the most versatile source of gas given its destination flexibility and will be needed in the long term as it provides a stable platform for the transition to renewables. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 851.93-860.78: High absolute gas prices around the world should ensure high levels of liquification utilization, while the potential for widening arbitrage between producers in the U.S. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 860.80-864.84: And consumers in Asia will have the additional benefit of lengthening to a mild demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 866.09-871.85: In addition, Europe is anticipated to exit this winter with historically low inventories of natural gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 872.69-877.60: This again has the potential to drive additional demand for LNG for inventory restocking. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 880.20-885.33: Slide 16 displays the energy carrier order book and delivery schedule according to program. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 886.89-893.95: There are 151 LNG carriers in the order book at present, but about 25% of underwater fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 895.58-905.25: Over 80% of the order book has secured multi-year employment. In addition, the number of scheduled deliveries in 2022 are less than half total delivery in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 905.93-909.45: And there are no unfixed vessel schedules this delivery in years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 911.23-917.86: Due to increasing demand for container ships and other merchant vessels, delivery time for the new building order today at approximately three years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 918.44-921.72: Making the earliest elevate time in the first half of 2025. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 923.04-932.95: Competition for bird slots at the yard, as well as cost inflation, have also pushed prices well above 210 million, up at least 10% over the last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 935.72-941.30: Slide 17 illustrates our view of shipping supply and demand through the end of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 943.12-950.45: Demand is partly based on the number of vessels needed to export 1 million tons of LNG per annum expressed as a shipping multiplier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.77-961.64: This analysis does not assume any vessel scrapping, although there are currently 20 vessels or about 3% of the global fleet over the age of 30. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 961.68-964.90: And we saw nine vessels crapped in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.59-975.72: Although there's a relatively strong addition to global shipping capacity, we anticipate that the growth of inter-basin trading and likely a survey to recycling will be a tonnage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 975.74-979.52: Will more than offset the scheduled deliveries over the next couple of years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 980.00-984.66: Projecting a relatively tight LNG shipping market through 2022 and 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 988.05-990.43: Turn into slide 18 and end summary. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 993.11-1002.36: I'm very pleased with the overall operation, safety results, as well as the partnership financial achievement for quarter four 2021 and for the full year as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1004.60-1012.41: This latest energy crisis has once more shown the pivotal importance of energy as cleaner fuel to supply the current energy need. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1012.43-1015.60: And enable a sustainable transition to our carbon-free future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1017.54-1025.05: Our fleet is well positioned to the upside of this increase in demand for LNG and a tight shipping market expected in 2022 and the years to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1026.67-1037.80: And we've made good progress on our capital allocation strategy with continuous deleveraging and opportunistically purchase of preference units in the open market, creating equity value to the unit holder. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1039.68-1047.27: Finally, the partnership increase in competitiveness and strengthening balance sheet allows us to evaluate opportunities for growth and fleet modernization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1049.19-1054.55: With that, I'd like to open calls for questions. Operator? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1055.96-1062.88: Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1063.36-1066.03: Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.13-1071.31: Our first question will come from Randy Givens with Jeffries. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1080.10-1085.35: Mr. Gibbons, your line is open. Please go ahead. Howdy, gentlemen. How's it going? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1087.21-1092.83: Hi. Hi, Andy. It's good. Hey, hey. So I guess the first question, just looking at your fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1093.05-1098.18: You have a handful of vessels coming open, a few TSE, a few steam. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.84-1107.11: How soon do you plan on securing charter for those and then will the likely duration be one year? And then specifically for the steamships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1107.45-1111.61: What are your thoughts on employment there for 2022 and 2023? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1115.90-1117.82: Thank you, and Andy, for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1119.16-1124.56: Yes, indeed, we have vessels that are being opened in order to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1125.79-1134.17: We're actually quite comfortable in the 22 charted coverage. I mean, we are covered 76% and our portfolio is quite balanced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.24-1144.20: We see opportunities in the opening of the vessels in quarter two and in quarter three ahead of the winter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1144.60-1152.53: And we expect a high level of LNG movement, both in terms of capacity and in terms of shipping demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1153.83-1159.42: We see, as we mentioned before, we actually see that the term market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1159.44-1164.40: Is remaining quite strong even in the low terms of the COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1165.01-1173.91: So, I think there's no indication that we will not be able to play a portfolio approach and actually fix the vessels throughout 42 and 43. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1173.93-1175.40: Much like we've done last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.02-1182.16: Got it. And then in terms of STEAM employment, you know, 23 and beyond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1185.49-1195.44: I think for the steams, we actually see similar dynamics as weíve seen for the TFDs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1195.78-1197.88: There are many... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1197.90-1202.88: Far eastern ommitator that seems to favor steam vessels over others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1203.28-1208.79: Some terminals are actually only accepting this size and type of vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1209.35-1215.68: And I think we have really no indication that it's going to be otherwise for the steam vessels than it is for the TFPEs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.24-1220.54: Whether we will be able to find longer terms than one year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1220.56-1227.61: Is yet to be seen, but I think the indications for other traveling that has been done for similar vessels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1227.93-1232.41: I've also seen terms exceeding the one year, so we're quite confident on that as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1234.07-1238.80: Got it. All right, and then in terms of balance sheet and capital allocation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1239.10-1247.39: Could we see some additional sale leasebacks in the near term and what would that incremental cash proceeds be used for? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1247.51-1255.18: You purchased, I think it was 6 million of preference or preferred units during the quarter, about 18 million during the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1255.38-1260.70: So if you look at 22, could additional repurchases there be a use of cash? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1264.18-1273.29: You are right, we have with the improved charter market, we have an improved liquidity position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1273.71-1282.86: So we will look for additional prep repurchases on an opportunistic basis. We have been buying back 18 million of preps at par. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1283.72-1285.17: Which is a good deal I think. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1285.59-1295.03: There is the first series of our press is callable in early 2023 so that we don't really have any reason to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1295.06-1297.82: To pay much above part to buy back. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.98-1301.16: So we'll keep an eye on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1301.70-1304.46: I wanted to reiterate our capital allocation strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1304.58-1310.17: That we are focusing on the debt repayment and the breakeven reductions, which actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1310.19-1315.16: Improve the equity value of our story. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1315.54-1324.02: And in terms of the silent leasebacks, we will see. I mean, we don't really need the incremental liquidity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1326.33-1328.89: It is a strategy that we. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1329.89-1336.80: CFPB selling this back a while ago because we wanted to have access in the Chinese market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1337.68-1338.98: Will be probably the opposite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1343.04-1344.54: Well, that's it for me, thanks so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1346.79-1352.67: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Nolan with CFO. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1355.30-1358.78: This is actually Frank Galanti for Ben. Thanks for taking our questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1359.64-1362.82: I wanted to start on the steamships. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1363.74-1366.81: Specifically around FSRU, FSU conversion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1367.75-1377.54: It sort of seems like that market could be opening up, I guess. Is that something that you guys are considering for those vessels? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1380.20-1381.96: I think it's Paolo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.12-1388.37: Yeah, indeed. I think as we discussed before online, this question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.67-1400.00: I think the good thing about having a portfolio approach is that it really allows us to look opportunistically to short-term supply and also infrastructure development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.58-1404.90: Now this kind of project, as you know, they take quite a long time to develop. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1405.37-1408.63: There are different stages from feasibility to... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1408.65-1416.02: To FID and even the post-FID, there's typically a certain amount of time before you are actually able to deploy the asset. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1416.36-1420.88: With a light or a heavier conversion if it's an FSA-U. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1421.52-1423.66: I can confirm that we are looking at that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1423.94-1430.25: I think there has been also a public announcement of the Venice Energy Project in Australia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1430.61-1442.80: Were gas loopholes as one vessel that is being held as the sole proposal to the FSU development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.22-1447.65: I think that's the public display of how our interest is materializing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1448.03-1450.71: Again, nothing that we report more than this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1450.99-1460.18: Because, you know, time is needed to come to a final development. But we'll provide further updates as this and maybe other opportunities come along. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1463.38-1471.55: Okay, that's helpful. And then switching gears a little bit, I wanted to ask more of a longer term question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.41-1477.54: Sort of understand the current capital allocation strategy is to focus on deleveraging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1478.92-1486.21: So I guess, what's the end game for that? When can the partnership start thinking about growth? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1487.41-1489.73: Another way of thinking about it is like... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.27-1494.41: But when you get below that four times leverage and 48% net debt to cap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1494.95-1500.38: Is that when you start to think about acquiring vessels or is that when you start to think about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1501.06-1507.51: Just what are the thoughts on a long-term growth strategy? Yeah, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1508.75-1516.84: I do understand that the typical approach to this is asking when. I think for us it's really what we're trying to achieve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1517.08-1521.90: And what is our current strategy going to do for the business and the shittles of value? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1522.42-1530.23: And if you look at it, we are, you know, the target are really there to sustain the gas-lit properties through the inevitable shipping cycles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1530.37-1536.84: To be more competitive because we are actually reducing our cost level and we're becoming more profitable. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.30-1540.00: We're building a stronger balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.50-1548.21: And I think these are really the priorities we have given ourselves. And we believe even in this, call it transitional phase,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1548.69-1552.89: This is a very tangible way to deliver shareholder value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1554.63-1560.00: How this is going to pan out when we get there, I think it's really. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1560.86-1569.17: Going to be seen on where the market will be on new buildings, on existing tonnage, on other consolidation opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.99-1574.39: I think, you know, the path there is very clear and that's what we're really focusing on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.26-1581.12: The point here. I think there is something that we need to, we want to highlight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.42-1591.09: Today, our share price, we believe it's quite low. We believe we are at a value. We have 230 million of market cap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1591.75-1596.82: And we paid down debt on an annual basis of $113 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1596.96-1598.90: So this is pretty much critical. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1599.60-1605.91: We have a cash balance of 446 million, which is again a significant amount versus our market cap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1606.47-1612.69: And our annual adjusted dividend was equal to our market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1613.61-1618.00: So our strategy delivers significant equity value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1618.70-1623.30: And we want to get our balance sheet to the point that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1623.32-1631.13: The board will be able to review all alternative options on the leveraging and buybacks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1631.15-1637.08: Dividend policy and growth and take the right decisions at the right time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1641.74-1650.41: That's helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Weatherby with Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1652.01-1653.09: Thanks for taking the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.23-1663.32: I guess a few questions here. First, just on the fleet, I want to make sure I understand the strategy in terms of the chartering activity that you're expecting in 2Q and 3Q. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.18-1667.77: What do you expect the duration that you think you can get on these open ships? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1667.81-1674.43: How much can you cover and how much do you want to cover? So I guess what is the depth in the period market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1674.45-1682.14: Would you be willing to go a little longer if the opportunity presents itself, or is this going to be a strategy of keeping some exposure to the market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1684.94-1687.73: Hi, Fiz. Thanks for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1689.39-1695.28: I think that the answer is that we are really open to all the possibilities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.84-1702.92: And I think we want to play to the strength of the market and what the market is going to offer, also with the assets that will come open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.50-1712.53: If we rewind back to 2021, I think the choice of accepting term coverage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1713.65-1721.54: For us to be able to re-deliver in quarter two and quarter three 2022 has so far paid out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1722.60-1727.37: And we believe that this is something that, you know, we'll basically use the same approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1727.69-1737.44: To see whether the one-year chart availability or the spot market is going to show the strength that we look for, then we'll definitely go for these opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1738.04-1741.08: We are, there's no, let's say,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1741.16-1745.09: There's no barrier to look at other business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1745.49-1755.64: But, you know, if we go longer, then the rates will have to make sure that, you know, they compare well to the one year or the spot child that I'd. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.02-1758.10: I think, you know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1758.12-1765.29: We have the size and the amount of vessels that are going to get open sequentially through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1765.35-1769.41: That would really allow us to take a more opportunistic approach. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1769.67-1778.92: And a portfolio approach as well. So we might want to see coverage if the opportunity arises and then be more tactical if the opportunity comes toward the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.22-1782.10: Okay, okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1782.54-1786.79: And then I guess I was curious in terms of your outlook, you talk about it on slide 17. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1787.21-1794.45: The 2.1 times multiplier for U.S. Cargoes over the course of the last couple of years, I think that's the assumption that you're using for 22 and 23. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.53-1797.92: What has been the experience over the course of the last quarter or two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.70-1807.97: Kind of to get a sense of where that number stands now and where it may sort of be dislocated for, you know, in the immediate future, given the concerns going on around the world relative to supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1811.31-1813.37: Yeah, look, the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1813.63-1818.40: The shipping multiplier is really an indication of what has actually happened. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1818.68-1825.81: We all recognize the dynamics of the large increase in US production and the large import in the Far East. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1826.89-1831.49: I agree with you that in the past quarter we have seen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1831.51-1839.68: A different balance coming up with JKM and TTF sometimes swapping positions on the leading cost part. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1841.68-1844.44: You know, actually we see that from two different angles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1844.58-1854.49: From one, yes indeed, the shipping multiplier will decrease if the US to Europe will remain the leading side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.81-1858.02: On the other hand, we have also seen, and some of our vessels have done it,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1858.14-1863.40: We have seen relapse from Asia back into Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1863.46-1870.09: In the last quarter, which has been another interesting boost of the whole sheet multiplier. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1870.53-1871.63: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.73-1876.76: We typically have a part of our graph that actually shows this kind of balance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.78-1882.74: We decided not to admit it because it has actually flipped in the past week, I think, a couple of times. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.34-1899.74: The longer outlook anyway is for the Far East demand to be the name of the game and then to absorb the majority part of the US production as we've also seen from the latest long-term contract sign. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1899.76-1903.24: For instance, by Chenier with Farisma companies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1904.70-1906.87: Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that clarity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1907.85-1912.43: I guess two more really just sort of wrap up in terms of model of dynamics. You know, you highlight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1912.77-1919.78: Unit opex being down in 2022 in the outlook obviously unit gna stepping up i guess. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1920.24-1925.00: On the OPEC side, it sounds like there is no dry docking expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1925.25-1928.85: I guess what sort of a normalized rate you think you can achieve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1928.87-1939.80: With typical dry docking days accounted for. I'm probably thinking out to 2023, but that 13-7, is that closer to 14 and a half? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.82-1945.13: Half or so if you were to assume dry docking. You just want to get a sense of what the more sustainable run rate might be for the fleet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1950.65-1954.91: Listen, I mean, we don't have a dialogue in next year, as you say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1955.70-1964.80: We have dry logins though in 2023, so there is a seasonality there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1965.49-1969.09: The dry dockings are not reflected in the OPEX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1969.39-1971.25: So it's a CapEx item, as you said. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1971.63-1975.54: And we do dry dogmas every five years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1975.96-1980.60: And normalized item. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1980.64-1986.55: I don't know, it could be 1000, but let's take it offline and to help you model this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1990.03-1991.75: Where maybe you can step up there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1994.51-2001.66: The unit DNA is as we give it, it is 3,200. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2002.22-2007.35: And this actually reflects an increase on the administrative fee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2007.73-2013.47: Which on the other side, counterbalance from the decrease on the management fee. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2014.05-2017.98: We will present you now to MDF and detail the device management fees. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2018.26-2022.54: But you have the fallback features there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2025.37-2031.97: Okay. Okay. Well, thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2033.03-2037.62: Thank you. As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star, then 1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2047.81-2054.73: Thank you for participating in today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2062.04-2064.86: Thank you. Thank you, Shiri. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.29-2072.37: Well, thank you everyone today for listening and thank you for your continued interest in GasWalk Limited and in GasWalk Partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.57-2084.72: We certainly appreciate your questions today, your time, and we look forward to speaking to you in the next quarter as, hopefully, traveling becomes safer and maybe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2084.74-2087.93: Hopefully, maybe we'll be able to meet many of you in person soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2088.55-2096.30: In the meantime, stay safe and again, if you have any questions, please contact us and contact the investor relationship team. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2097.08-2099.98: And enjoy the rest of your day. Bye. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.86-2106.53: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. 
asr:0: END
