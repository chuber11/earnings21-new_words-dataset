asr:0: OUTPUT 926.47-933.21: In 2021, we will continue our journey from a traditional mobile telecoms operator to an emerging digital operator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 934.29-939.18: We're there for designated 2021, that's the year of the customer, the digital experience.

asr:0: OUTPUT 953.95-961.96: If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star and then 2. Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then 1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 962.92-965.41: The first question we have is from John Kim from UBS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 969.17-973.47: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the opportunity. Two unrelated questions, please. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 973.83-976.18: Firstly, cash flow to the group level. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 976.48-985.79: We should be thinking about the management fee as well as the dividend. On the dividend counts, we should be using about 83% if I heard you correctly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 986.07-990.79: Of the collective dividend up to group? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 991.43-999.68: Second question, I know that there's been some legal process around NTN-Ghana being declared dominant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 999.78-1005.29: That's done and dusted. And have you seen any remedies or do you know of ones to come? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1008.37-1014.81: Thank you for your question. Can you just clarify the very first question about hash flow group? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1015.32-1019.18: I wasn't sure if it was just a statement or a question. I wasn't quite sure what the question itself was. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1020.36-1029.97: Sure. My understanding is that Ghana pays a management fee to group and it's also entitled to a share of the dividend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1029.99-1038.32: At the Ghanaian level. And my understanding from what you said earlier is that's about an 83% ownership. Question mark. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1041.42-1046.25: Okay. So what was the question? You want us to clarify that or? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1046.27-1052.41: Because you restated the facts and it's correct. I'm not sure what exactly the question is. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1053.21-1059.74: Hi, sorry, can you quantify that for us in either RANDS, CDE, or more dollars, please? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1061.12-1065.53: Okay, on the total dividends plus management fee paid out to group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.15-1069.21: Okay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1069.97-1077.92: So I'll hand that question over to Kobi, who is the acting CFO. But before Kobi comes in, let me just answer the question on SMP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1079.04-1088.53: And yes, you know, MTN was declared a significant market power, market player in July 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1089.09-1098.96: And since then there have been a number of developments. At this stage, in October 2020, we implemented one of the seven remedies that were imposed on us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1099.46-1103.30: And which was a 30% reduction in asymmetric interconnect rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1104.28-1113.89: And we continue to have dialogue and discussions with the regulators while we look at the implementation of the remaining six remedies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1114.61-1131.37: Our primary objective is to get to a point where the remedies that are implemented have a long-term impact on the sustainability of the industry. It's really important because that would ensure that the objectives of S&P are met broadly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1132.15-1141.40: As opposed to a reduction in MTNs performance based but minimal impact on the industry. So that's really what the discussions are about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1141.84-1144.16: And the engagement so far have been encouraging. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1144.46-1153.99: However, it stalled to some degree following the election in December and the ongoing process to appoint the substantive Minister for Communications and Digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1154.37-1162.92: Once that process is concluded, we'll be able to resume discussions and progress, and we'll be able to give an update at the next quarterly investor call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1163.38-1171.59: I'll hand over to Kobi now to give you the numbers and the details for the dividend and management sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1175.82-1182.96: This is Kobi for dividends and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1183.58-1193.05: For dividend and the managing fee that we expect to pay, it comes up to 949 million Ghana Cedis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1195.14-1200.88: We are paying dividend of 840 thereabouts and management fee of 268. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1207.23-1216.50: Thank you. The next question we have is from Mayurin Rajaratnam from MUPFA. Hi guys. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1217.96-1222.64: First question is about the interconnect traffic regulations and SMP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1224.32-1234.11: We saw that the voice revenue increase wasn't great, actually, it was a decrease of some sort in the fourth quarter, if I get my numbers right. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1234.91-1242.84: How much of the asymmetric cut is part of this, or is it purely just customer behavior and? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1243.24-1246.49: Or was there an additional competitive pressure or anything like that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1246.77-1249.59: Because you added subscribers. I'm just trying to understand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1250.53-1253.73: What are the dynamics behind this? Some color would be useful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1254.31-1260.68: And the second question is, excluding your wonderful product in wireless broadband, fixed broadband. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1262.58-1268.07: What's the average data usage in megabytes per customer? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1269.87-1277.70: Thank you. OK. Well, thank you very much. Let me start with the average data usage per customer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1278.92-1286.85: We're currently seeing somewhere between 3.5 gigs per customer per month to somewhere around 4 gigs per customer per month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.27-1296.82: So that's the average that consumers are using. Obviously, that number has increased during the year based on the demand for data and digital services as a result of COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1298.66-1305.77: Now the question you asked on voice, yes, the voice trend, if we look at the voice trend for 2020,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1305.89-1309.49: You would see a decline from Q1 into Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.57-1318.84: However, the Q4 trend is actually a bit of an anomaly because there's some one-time adjustment effects that are taking place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1320.30-1325.37: So that trickles up to the top line revenue as well, if you look at the year-on-year performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1326.15-1334.37: In terms of voice, just to give you some comfort, what we're seeing in Q1, at least in January so far, we double digit growth year on year for the month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1335.36-1339.66: So again, just to put that number into context, there were some one-off adjustments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1339.68-1347.49: Interconnect was related to that. And then the second component, which is not a one-time, but a permanent adjustment, will be the SMP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1348.07-1353.53: However, the MP effect is less than 1% of total revenue. It's about 0.6%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1354.13-1358.48: So that effect is not the most significant driver of the trend we're seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1359.34-1368.79: So we'd expect to come back to our normal trends around late single digits to early double digits as far as the voice growth year on year goes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1370.65-1375.32: Great. Just to come back on the data usage per subscriber. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1375.70-1382.76: Is that 3.5 to 4 gigs per mobile subscriber or is that also contains in the denominator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1382.84-1386.95: Your fixed wireless LTE product as well. So just one for the clarification. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1389.99-1391.39: Oh, that's pretty good. Thank you so much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1394.19-1398.30: Thank you. The next question we have is from Christiaan Dunn-Oddaer from NetBank. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.10-1404.54: Hi everyone, congratulations on the results and thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1405.05-1413.23: I've got two quick ones. I think a bit of it has been answered, but just on your Q4 operating metric. So, you know, your revenue and EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1414.15-1422.14: It seems to have slowed down in the last quarter. Now I know you're on the last question on my urine question, you mentioned that there were some one-off adjustments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.96-1425.63: Was there anything else that was causing the slowdown? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1425.83-1433.27: You know, up until September, it was looking pretty strong, both in terms of revenue and margins. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.29-1436.68: Quarter 4 looks quite weak and a huge slowdown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.62-1440.00: And then the second question, if I can. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1440.58-1446.27: I know you guys announced a buyback of 1.1 million shares in December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1446.33-1455.48: I think this was, this had like a deadline to get KYC for the subscribers done by the 23rd, which was about two days ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1456.04-1463.10: Is there any update on that on how much you guys have to do and how that impacts your, your overall localization? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1463.38-1466.99: To get to 25%. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1468.69-1476.56: Okay, thank you very much. Let me take the first question and I'll have Kobi answer the question on the buyback and what the implications are for localization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1477.74-1483.78: So in terms of the players, I think that's who we picked. When you look at overall performance, you mentioned revenue and EBITDA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1484.60-1490.43: I believe the answer I gave previously on the revenue side should satisfy the revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1491.31-1499.30: However, if you look at the EBITDA trend as well, there was some impact and an appearance of a slowdown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1499.80-1502.38: The reason for that is primarily... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1504.34-1508.85: Once we have an ease up of supply chains,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1509.01-1515.98: We're able to accelerate or further accelerate our CAPEX deployment, and that has a direct impact on our A-bid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1516.18-1524.02: So for the previous quarter, because of that slowdown, we're not as aggressive in capital spend as we would normally be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1524.10-1527.17: And a lot of that capex and that have been spent in Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1527.51-1533.93: So that's the explanation for the bottom line side. My previous answer should hopefully address the revenue side of that as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.64-1539.04: Learning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1541.34-1548.83: Okay, so on the buyback, it's due to KYC issues as you are aware. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1549.95-1554.33: We've managed this process with the regulator. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1555.14-1562.08: So we are going through the process of updating the KYCs of the related parties. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1563.12-1571.57: We've gotten to the end of the process where the outstanding ones will be brought back and sold onto the market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1572.21-1581.20: So that is the position where it has no effect on the 12.5% because that one is locked per the initial IPU that we had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.60-1584.62: That that number is locked, it doesn't have any impact on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.79-1589.25: COVID, I mean... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1589.27-1599.36: Can you give us an indication of how many of those that 1.1 million share of subscribers have actually done their KYC? So is the impact going to be a lot less than the 1.1? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.44-1610.81: The last check of it, it's 1,420 potential shareholders have updated their records. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.35-1620.60: Okay. All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You're welcome. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.98-1624.60: The next question we have is from Jonathan Kennedy Good from J.P. Morgan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1627.51-1633.07: Afternoon. I just wanted to come back to your revenue guidance of 13 to 15 percent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1634.47-1639.12: You mentioned that voice was growing double digits so far this year and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1639.68-1645.65: The other lines are all growing 20% to north of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1645.67-1658.20: Trying to understand why the conservative guidance is there, you know, potentially more competitive pressure on the voice arising given changes in termination rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1659.52-1664.54: And then second question, just on your digital revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1665.33-1670.31: Could you tell us how many iYoba users you actually have and what kind of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1670.33-1675.86: Revenue opportunities you see in there, whether that's starting to scale somewhat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.24-1683.24: Okay. All right. Let me just try to give some context, first of all, on the voice side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.32-1688.77: Yes, we're seeing double-digit voice growth so far this year. It's one month in the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1689.71-1698.16: However, what I said before was that we expect only voice growth year on year, somewhere between the high single digits to the early double digits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1699.48-1703.52: Voice is something like 40%, 41% of total revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1703.74-1710.87: So a single-digit, late single-digit to early double-digit year-on-year growth will pull down the bulk of the total revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1711.27-1715.20: So that's the first reason why the estimators are taking the 15%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1715.88-1718.16: The second component is that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1718.18-1720.14: One, SMP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1720.16-1728.65: Deployment or remedy implementation has only started so there will be some incremental impact of SMP depending on where we land with the ministry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1728.67-1734.21: Which, while a new development before we gave our estimates of 13 to 15,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1734.49-1742.52: We've maintained the estimates of 13 to 15 despite the incremental impact of some of the S&P measures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1742.96-1749.05: And so I think it's a reasonable assessment of where we believe we'll land by the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1751.03-1756.82: In terms of IOBA users, we entered last year over 700,000 IOBA users. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.24-1764.50: And in terms of revenue today, I mean, we're not really generating revenue from IOBA. It's a platform strategy that we have in mind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1764.62-1766.45: Uber is intended to be a super app. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.87-1773.07: So at this stage, it's really driving adoption and building a usage behavior. And monetization will be at another stage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1773.49-1781.30: And so for now, revenue is not a primary focus. We're just building a base so that we can expand on the platform capabilities of IOBA as part of our long-term strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1788.03-1794.03: Thank you. The next question we have is from Sunil Rajpopal from HSBC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1794.75-1797.38: Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.44-1803.40: I just wanted to check on the regulatory developments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1803.78-1805.25: I know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1805.45-1810.25: There is some, some, some, uh, inquisitions made right now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1810.31-1820.00: And what is your take from the discussions that are ongoing with the regulator and do you expect any more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1821.54-1825.21: Anymore new rules coming up on this regard? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1828.83-1831.01: Thanks for your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1831.07-1840.78: I think the first thing to point out is that there were seven remedies that were imposed at the time of sending out the SMP and designation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1841.68-1843.72: And of those, only one has been implemented. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1844.30-1849.71: While our discussions have been encouraging, we would expect a few more to be implemented through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1850.43-1854.27: What we're focused on currently in our engagement is really there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1854.29-1861.90: Implementation, the definition of those specific remedies to ensure that a broader objective of SMP is achieved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1862.58-1869.09: And those discussions, like I said, have stalled since the elections and once the substantive minister is put in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1869.71-1877.58: We will resume those discussions and progress to a point where we can give you something more specific probably at the next quarterly update. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1878.30-1885.73: But for now, we've implemented the one, which is 30% reduction in asymmetric interconnect. And we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1887.85-1890.39: And maybe if I can just follow up. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.63-1891.95: Amen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1892.13-1909.77: What would you think probably the implications would be given that the government is planning to acquire or propose to acquire one of these smaller operators there? So what kind of potential implications do you foresee there from that moment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.47-1917.92: It's a very difficult question to answer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1918.26-1926.49: And because there has really been very little shared on this acquisition by government of El Tego. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1927.45-1928.47: Now just to point out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1928.59-1936.54: Typically, in a situation where there's an acquisition from a buyer, you would understand their investment appetite, the ambition of the new buyer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1936.88-1943.64: If it's really just to hold the same position, if it's really to challenge for number one, number two, if it's really to build scale. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.02-1948.17: And based on that understanding, we'll be able to model a potential impact. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1948.81-1957.26: At this point, the only thing that has been shared is the fact that government interest is to ensure that jobs are secured and jobs are saved. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1957.92-1966.77: However, on the business side, there's been no indication of the ambition and no indication of the potential investment strategy of a potential new buyer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1967.57-1972.89: And we also understand that government's role may be just to hold and attract new investors. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1973.39-1977.38: So we're still at a very early stage as far as what the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1977.60-1986.85: What the outcome of this process would look like and based on that would have a much more concrete sense of the impact. So I apologize, I don't want to give you a real sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1987.35-1991.49: But we continue to monitor this and to the extent that we can share thoughts on the impact, we will. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1998.36-2007.13: Have is from Nick Padgett from Frontura Capital. Hello and again thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2009.09-2014.57: I again want to apologize, I again want to ask about revenue that some of the other questioners have asked about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2015.18-2019.12: Undoubtedly, in total, it was a great year for 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.14-2027.95: But as others have mentioned, Q4, the revenue pace was a little softer. And I've heard everything you've said so far, but I still have a few. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2027.97-2030.89: You know, uncertainties about the Q4 numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.27-2035.40: My observation is that sequentially if we look at the two prior years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2035.84-2043.48: You're going back to 2018, Q4 revenue was 15% higher than Q3, and in 2019, it was 9% higher. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2044.00-2046.65: But this year it was basically flat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2048.21-2050.39: I heard you say there were some one-offs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2050.45-2059.50: But that would be quite a bit of one-off to, you know, be that, to explain all of that difference. So I wonder, is there something else, like,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2059.52-2067.13: You know, COVID really, I think, helped your revenue in the first three quarters. Could it be that things are normalizing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2068.25-2073.87: And so the slower growth is a result of the normalization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.97-2084.72: Although your guidance, you know, as mentioned is sort of unchanged, so that maybe is counter to that point. Or was there just anything else unique about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2084.74-2093.41: For other than the one-offs or maybe the one-offs were bigger than I thought. I'm just still, you know, still looking for some additional kind of clarity on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2093.43-2096.18: If you could explain Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2098.24-2102.48: Let me start by saying if we normalize the effects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2102.50-2109.37: For the adjustments that we made, Q4 over Q3 would have been about a 9% year-on-year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2109.79-2112.11: It would have been in line with 2019, as you mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2113.13-2122.74: So that's a starting point, right? If I take the second point, are we seeing a change in trend from a consumer behavior standpoint? The answer is yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2123.58-2128.07: We're seeing a lot more people using data and digital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2128.19-2136.20: As far as the pandemic goes, changes in behaviors from people going to physical school and now at home working. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2137.26-2144.48: But if I look at the Q1 to Q4 trend, it doesn't suggest that there is a specific issue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.76-2152.07: We looked at what happened in Q4, most of our schools went back and therefore the usage of data from home would have gone down. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2152.45-2158.80: But that will be compensated for by other behavior. So there's quite a lot going on in terms of shifts in behavior. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2159.26-2162.44: And once the easing of the restrictions start to unfold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2162.62-2169.81: Those behavior changes that we saw in Q2, Q3 would be reversed as well. So there's quite a lot of mix going on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2170.05-2171.39: But organically. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2171.43-2177.56: Yet, we're seeing a slower growth in voice than we're seeing for the other areas, which is expected. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2177.62-2183.70: But not to the extent that the numbers will depict here because if we normalize, we're seeing something like a 9% junior group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2184.97-2193.25: Okay. 9% sequential from Q3 to Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2193.91-2200.22: So that's, thank you for clarifying that. That's more than I would have guessed. And maybe you said that number at the beginning and I missed it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2201.44-2204.02: But so what. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.24-2211.01: I mean, given that it's such a large number, what kind of one-offs, what kind of adjustments would these be? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2211.57-2221.02: It clarifies one answer and then raises a new question of just what are those? I wouldn't have guessed that kind of one-offs could occur. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.94-2232.07: Sure, so outside of SMP, there was interconnects and there was also a principal agent adjustment on the digital side that affected the overall total business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2232.15-2238.18: And perhaps we can go offline and go into a bit more detail on this if you would like. The finance team can work you through this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.00-2242.56: But those are the two areas that we made the adjustment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2245.63-2249.99: Okay. Were these... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2250.21-2256.58: So I'm going to ask this because I think it's on my mind and probably others, and I understand you probably won't give me a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2258.02-2261.86: I won't be able to answer it, but I'll just ask anyway for the benefit of everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2262.66-2272.47: Sometimes we see when a company has a great nine months, they take the foot off the accelerator a bit and they still report a very good year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2273.07-2280.18: Or discretionary items that don't necessarily have to be recognized are recognized to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2280.52-2284.00: In Q4 and so I just can't help wondering if that's the case of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2285.33-2295.96: Maybe the Q4 you report is a bit of a low aberration because you could still have a great year anyway and that just, you know, sets you up for, you know, another good growth year next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2297.60-2306.71: It's a creative question, but no, the answer is no. We have to make these adjustments and we should see an evening out of these through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2307.83-2310.91: Fair enough. Thank you for answering. You're welcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2314.47-2318.32: The next question we have is from Ali Nasir from Burgess. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2320.70-2325.67: Hi Solomon team, thank you for the opportunity. I just have questions around... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2327.21-2336.02: Maybe starting with the structure of any potential transaction that takes local ownership to 30% by the new timeline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2336.90-2344.94: Just curious, how do you ensure that the interests of NTN Ghana shareholders are not only protected but maximized in case of a transaction? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2346.71-2351.79: How do you, what kind of transaction options do you foresee to get to 30%? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2353.81-2359.12: Okay, so at this point, I mean, it's a bit early for us to tell. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2360.34-2368.65: However, what I can say is if you look at the SCANCOM levels, SCANCOM is a wholly owned, more money limited to wholly owned subsidiary of SCANCOM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2370.01-2378.72: And then we were able to achieve the 25% of SCANCOM and split the shareholdings across More Money Limited. We would have achieved 25% of the 30%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2379.80-2388.61: So the question you're asking really applies to the 5% surplus above the 25%, and we haven't defined a structure for that as yet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2388.81-2397.42: But just to sort of explain the component of the 30% that will be impacted by the question, that would be the 5% that remains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2397.94-2401.08: Once we make progress on this, we'll share that with you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.10-2403.34: Again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2405.81-2414.51: The interest of shareholders will absolutely be taken into consideration for effects such as dilution and things like that. I'm sure that's where the question is going. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2415.56-2419.12: Yeah, I didn't even think about indirect. That's really helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2419.44-2429.29: Just on that point, the ESOP, will that need to vest in 2021 for it to count as local shares or does it have a longer vest duration? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2431.17-2437.26: So it has a longer vesting duration. So there are two components there in about three years to five years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2439.18-2446.93: So you would recognize the local, I guess you'd recognize these shares as they count as local shares. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2448.49-2455.64: That's right, but the allocation will be made and reserved. But it would become real shares once they pass, yes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2457.08-2459.94: Great. And just operationally on MoMA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2460.74-2465.35: The monetization has been really impressive if you look at just revenue per average user. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2466.39-2468.83: Can you just talk about some of the initiatives that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2468.85-2476.56: Put in place this year or whether consumers have changed the way they use OMO that have driven that monetization? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2476.68-2479.26: And then the second part to that question is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2479.28-2485.97: I've noticed that the subscriber growth in Momo has lagged voice and data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2486.11-2492.95: In the year and I was wondering, you know, what do you think is preventing faster adoption and penetration among your voice users? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2495.30-2501.66: Okay, I think a way to think about that, let me just start with the growth in MOMO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2502.54-2512.25: Both MoMo and Data have about the same number of active users, 10.7, 10.8. The difference is not really significant. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2512.37-2518.58: If you really think about the need for data versus the need for Momo in a year like we've just had. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2519.28-2525.99: Then it's actually quite impressive that Momo is keeping pace with data growth in terms of subscribers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2526.79-2535.14: I think, you know, we may have under-indexed in data in previous years and we may have done better, which is why you're seeing a slight difference in the percentages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2535.92-2545.17: But if you look at the actual numbers, MoMo and active data are exactly the same using the NPM definition, which for me suggests that MoMo is actually doing quite well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.15-2553.83: So that's a fair point. In terms of monetization, a number of things have happened. One, we've increased SEPs by about 60%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.37-2559.30: But we've also seen a significant increase in usage in average transactions per user. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.14-2565.09: And it's really important because if you look at other markets, you know, Manchuria, Kenya, for example. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2565.23-2570.91: The biggest driver of Apple growth is increased frequency of transactions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2571.25-2578.28: And two, increased frequency of transactions across a broader base of sub-products within the MoreMoney suite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2578.34-2580.12: So when we think about advanced services,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2580.72-2584.88: Things like our loan products, international remittances, payment services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2585.89-2594.21: Those new products allow users to have a higher level of stickiness and subsequently a higher level of usage per user per month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2594.51-2599.30: We've seen significant growth there, upwards of five transactions a month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2599.80-2605.67: Of around a 4 to 4.5. So it's a 20 to 30% increase in usage frequency as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2606.07-2615.68: So those are the primary drivers. And as we continue to expand our product portfolio, we should continue to see these usage frequencies increase over the coming years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2618.70-2624.18: That's also in the context of zero rating on the 100 study, that kind of growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2625.89-2628.43: That's correct, yeah. That's correct. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2629.99-2637.46: Just on that point, Salam, if you don't mind, as of, if you look forward, or maybe just looking at 2020,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2638.00-2643.46: How do they split up between peer-to-peer and some of the new products that are more sticky in nature? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2645.91-2654.63: Sure. If I take our advanced services in total, we're talking 12% to 15% in terms of percent of revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2655.80-2664.54: They're still growing as far as the product mix is concerned, and the level of adoption there is also still growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2665.37-2676.26: But if we think of the future, you know, advanced services really represent the future of more money because the basic transactions, P2P, cash in, cash out,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2676.28-2679.12: Will start to normalize in terms of incremental growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2679.88-2688.63: So for us, it's really building the foundations for the future and making sure that we get that mix right so that we can continue to sustain the growth as we go forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2689.63-2691.73: So that's really their response to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2693.75-2699.18: Great, last one just on this is just related to the float size which you show on the balance sheet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2699.68-2705.11: I think he's exceeded the billion dollars. It's about double versus the 2019 December close. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2705.77-2714.95: I calculate that, I don't know if this is the right way of doing it, but if you look at kind of an average wallet size, it's now over $100, about $170. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2715.82-2722.56: And I was just wondering if that is consistent with what you observe or am I looking at things from an accounting basis? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2722.70-2726.35: Because that seems like a big number for Ghana in the wallet side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2728.17-2734.45: Sure, I think the first thing to note is that the float covers a couple of different areas. It covers our merchants,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2735.20-2739.04: It covers our consumers and it covers our agents. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2740.06-2749.15: And I believe the bank float may be part of that as well. So it's hard to take that number and just divide it by the number of customers and get the wallet size. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2750.39-2755.98: Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for that clarification. You're welcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2758.16-2765.37: Thank you. So we have a few more questions on the conference call. Do you have time to take a few? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2768.41-2772.09: Maybe we can take just a few more questions and then we can end the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2773.15-2778.42: Not a problem. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2781.18-2784.74: Hi, good afternoon, good morning. Congrats on the great results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2785.95-2792.49: A couple of questions for me. Could you just talk about the growth in both voice and data you're seeing? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2793.41-2799.88: Do you have any indication if these are market share gains? Is the market growing as quickly as you guys? And could you... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2799.90-2808.57: Talk a little bit about any kind of pushback from your two competitors. It sounds like, as you said, Tego and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2809.15-2814.33: Airtel, that's a bit more complicated, but just any update on competition would be helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2815.52-2822.66: Also, the 139 million CDs that you guys booked as related to sort of COVID initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2823.26-2832.23: I'm assuming that's on the income statement and is it fair to assume that a lot of that comes out in 2021 or are these going to be recurring expenses? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2833.47-2842.58: And then last question, I just want to confirm, you said the advanced services and MoMo is around 12 to 13% of revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2844.54-2851.03: And last year, I think that was you guys were closer to like maybe 2 or 3% in that line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2851.11-2859.78: Am I right in saying that and can you just unpack that a little bit? Where is the growth in that advanced services coming from? It sounds... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2859.80-2862.04: Sounds like you guys are gaining good momentum there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2864.58-2871.61: Okay, thanks for the questions. Let me start with advanced services. Last year we were just around 10%, not 3%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2872.15-2880.26: So we've seen something like a 40 to 50% growth in that line in terms of the percent of more money revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2881.38-2883.72: So that's just to clarify the numbers you have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2884.94-2891.91: The growth is really coming from payment where we continue to expand the number of merchants. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2892.71-2897.40: We came out of last year with about 150,000 admissions at the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2899.00-2906.09: We ended this year with over 170,000 merchants and we continue to see increased activity at various merchants points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2906.11-2912.29: The expansion of the merchants increases your ability to use and your opportunity to use your mobile money wallet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2912.95-2921.00: And in the year with the pandemic where there have been a lot of restrictions and things like that, that has also accelerated and helped accelerate the change in behavior. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.88-2931.75: And can I ask the relationship that MTM Group announced with MasterCard, is that being implemented in Ghana as well? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2935.36-2939.12: That's a global view for us, so yes, it will have an implication for Ghana as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2943.68-2946.55: Your second question was the $159 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2946.69-2954.57: Just to break it down, this is the COVID impact for us in terms of what we spent in cash but also what we've given up in revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.20-2965.11: So, the 139 includes the 94 million of P2P for more money limited and the balance of that would be what we spent in cash which would show up in our income statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2966.07-2974.07: So yes, we've continued the P2P, the free P2P for Ghana cities daily. We've continued that so far in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2974.89-2984.62: And in terms of the spend, we will continue to spend on COVID until we get to a point where we don't have any. So these numbers will be baked into 2021 as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2987.07-2993.61: The first question was on voice and data and if we're seeing market share growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2994.85-3000.88: I think in voice, market share has been marginally growing, but it's fairly flat. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3002.08-3008.63: But in terms of data we've seen some market-shared growth. Unfortunately, we haven't had a recent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3008.65-3016.84: A recent release from the NCA, a regulator on the industry position, and the numbers we have are quite old. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3017.48-3023.64: So until we receive that, it's hard to give a very concrete sense of whether we're seeing market sharing data or not. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3024.40-3028.85: I know all the operators as an industry that was a surge in demand for data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3029.63-3033.43: And therefore, to the extent that you're able to provide a capacity, you would see growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3034.45-3036.84: Especially during the COVID period. So I would expect. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3037.76-3046.39: That market share may have grown marginally in data or will remain about flat, thin load. That ought to have been an entire industry effect from COVID-19. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3048.63-3051.73: Got it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3054.03-3057.34: No, no, you continue on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3058.94-3060.64: Now, I was just going to say, in terms of competition,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3060.66-3069.27: I mean, the dynamics in the marketplace have been linked to the acquisition or the exit of Airtel and potentially Millicom from the market, like I said before. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3069.39-3077.30: We don't have enough details to really ascertain and assess what this means for our business going forward. And as soon as we have more information, we'll be able to share that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3077.78-3082.12: Our focus continues to be ensuring that we invest smartly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3082.76-3091.51: We continue to focus on resilience and quality of service. And we're also expanding our technology so that we can have 4G on every site in the coming years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3091.99-3099.18: And that continues to be our focus and also build out our home network and where we see a lot of opportunity in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3101.20-3105.02: Can I just one related question on competition and mobile money? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3105.47-3111.83: I mean, are you seeing, is there any competitive response there? I mean, you guys, my understanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3114.75-3123.46: In a bit of digging, I can do to try to understand sort of the distribution and agent network for Vodacom and Airtel-Tego. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3123.84-3126.25: I mean, it seems very, very limited. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3128.17-3134.09: I mean, are they even trying in mobile money at this point or is the gain yours right now? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3137.62-3143.56: Absolutely. And you know, for us if you think about mobile money today,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3143.80-3148.03: We're talking by the MTN definition about 10 million customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3148.91-3152.93: We have a population of about 30, 32, 31 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3153.63-3160.06: So, I mean, that's only 30% of the total population from an active more money user penetration standpoint. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3161.38-3168.67: From that perspective, I mean, I think there is a lot of opportunity to continue to drive financial inclusion, you know, point one. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3169.89-3176.58: But if you look at the frequency of transactions, it's still in single digits where we should be in double digits. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3177.62-3184.56: Now, to really get to double digits, you need an industry ecosystem maturity that allows that to happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3184.62-3193.71: For which we would need the other players in the market to continue to drive behaviors towards electronic currency, more money currency, things like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3193.73-3202.32: To an extent, at this stage of the game, any effort from our competitors would help accelerate the growth in the industry because it's at such a nascent stage. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3202.38-3204.92: Even though you have seen floating numbers of 6 billion and above,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3205.79-3210.25: I mean we're at a very, very young stage in terms of the more money opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3210.95-3219.18: So we don't see growth from our competitors as compromising the pie. We really see it as accelerating the growth of the pie. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.64-3229.51: And we can have a much larger share of that growth in terms of the growth of the pie. We can have a much larger share of that incremental growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3230.33-3231.35: So we encourage it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3231.39-3236.52: We also do think there is an innovation engine that's lacking in the marketplace. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3236.84-3241.46: And some of the initiatives from the central bank to try to lift these smaller players. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3241.82-3247.73: All of that will continue to drive innovation within the ecosystem to allow us to reach the maturity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3247.75-3257.04: That we require to continue to grow faster. So a lot of opportunity, I mean, we don't see that as negative at all. We would encourage more people to invest because it drives the whole market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3257.24-3263.38: There's still 90% of cash usage in Ghana at the moment, despite the pandemic and all of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3263.76-3271.89: There's a lot of work to be done and if we all bring our energies together as an industry, we'll get the ecosystem to grow and we'll be able to all benefit from that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3273.71-3279.86: Got it. All right. Thanks so much and congrats again on the great results. You're welcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3283.02-3287.15: Thank you. Final question is from Brad Buritsky from Equinox Partners. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3295.18-3299.62: Thank you for giving me the chance to ask the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3301.28-3304.30: I have two questions. The first is... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3304.36-3312.77: In the comments you talk about investing a billion and a half CD in network expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3313.11-3318.04: Whereas the CapEx for the year is roughly around a billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3318.46-3325.41: So I assume that the incremental half a billion CDs came out of the income statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3325.71-3333.79: I'm curious what part of network expansion you capitalize and what part you expense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3334.55-3338.84: And then the second question is, so you can... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3338.88-3346.39: We talk about 2021 being the year of the digital or your digitalization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3347.55-3351.89: What specific initiatives are you doing around that and what is that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3357.94-3365.05: The last part of your question you sort of dropped off. If you can just start from the ear of the customer and what initiatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3367.15-3376.96: What specific initiatives are you doing around that this year? And what does it really mean to be the year of the digital? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3380.00-3387.59: All right, so I'll take the second question and Kobi will answer the question on the CAPEX when we look at the core CAPEX versus the rest. He can give you the details there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3388.55-3395.90: So let me start with the year of the customer. So when we talk about the year of the customer, there are a number of different things that we look at. We have about six pillars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3397.30-3400.52: That we've developed in terms of digitizing our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3401.08-3408.51: And one of them is operations internally trying to automate and digitize a lot of our process internally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3408.95-3415.58: A lot of us are working from home now and therefore it's not only a good to have or a nice to have, but it's... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3415.66-3419.78: A need to have so that we can continue to work effectively and support the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3420.60-3425.29: So that's the first component, and I won't dwell too much on what that means, but we can go into the details there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3426.19-3433.51: The second one is really on our product side where today if you look at some of the initiatives we've launched, we've gone from using scratch cards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3434.23-3440.42: 15-20% of our rechart sales came from scratch cards two years ago and we've dropped that to about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3440.44-3444.42: 5% last year and we're saying we're going to get to zero by the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3445.15-3450.81: And again, that's part of digitizing our sales channel, our primary sales channel on ReCharge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3451.25-3456.40: Where you have newer channels that can support that transaction. So you have my MTN app for example. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3456.74-3462.92: We have electronic sales of recharge as far as agent goes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3463.56-3471.71: And you have these sort of different channels that you can purchase, recharge from. You'd have online channels as well, website channels and things like that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3473.13-3477.58: When we think about becoming a platform player in the next three to five years,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3477.60-3482.92: Then the foundation for that is really being built from our perspective around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3482.96-3489.73: OpenAPI for mobile money where we can have customers accessing our APIs and connecting to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3489.89-3493.49: Without having significant interaction with us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3494.09-3503.12: Looking at our Ioba super app, which started off as a messaging app, but we're looking at implementing micro apps. So if you think of WeChat in Asia,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3503.62-3505.11: That's really what Ayuba looks like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3505.65-3509.41: So currently we have about six or seven micro apps already implemented. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3509.93-3518.80: And we'll continue to expand on that, looking at relevant local apps that can sit within the IOBA ecosystem and continue to expand that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3518.88-3526.29: So it's a very exciting time for us. We're bringing a lot of things together. We see ourselves as sort of a central player. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3526.31-3529.89: Where we can be the core of a lot of these transactions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3529.99-3538.76: And the innovation from the startup industry can be on the outside of that core and connect to that core to be able to provide their services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3538.78-3540.34: To get in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3541.92-3550.05: When we think about customer experience, there is a lot of opportunity there as well. Today, a lot of people have to call in to our call center. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.73-3553.47: They have to walk to our stores to get basic service. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3553.97-3560.20: And a lot of these things can be done if you have the right digital platform. So my MTN is really the pivot for that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3560.70-3570.67: Where we're seeking to allow people to do things themselves. We want to increase the percent of self-service interactions with our support team. And that's a big focus for us this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3571.75-3578.82: So the number of initiatives around that, looking at things like chatbots, looking at AI that can support customers remotely. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3578.84-3582.52: Looking at IVR solutions as well, which we already have in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3582.54-3590.31: But really to expand the usage of these to our customers because our customers tend to be a bit shy of adopting some of these solutions that we have in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3591.03-3606.11: So that's just to list a few of them. But there are several other things that we're doing beyond just support, beyond just sales channels on the product side, simplification of our portfolio, digitizing their interactions, consolidating our short codes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3606.49-3610.23: These are all things we're doing to simplify the journey and the experience for our customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3610.69-3618.42: And finally, on the technology side, ensuring that our technology platforms and infrastructure can support a digital ecosystem. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3618.44-3622.34: So the network, this is why having 4G on every site is important to us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3622.86-3625.55: And two, looking at modernizing our eye systems. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3625.57-3635.10: So that we can have the right environment from a security standpoint, from an operational standpoint, and from a reliability standpoint to deliver on these digital services. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3635.48-3639.08: So there's quite a lot baked in there that we're working on. We're going to be very busy this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3642.06-3643.36: All right, great. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3645.37-3653.85: Yeah, on the Capex side, just to clarify, all Capex spend capitalized within the year they occur. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3653.95-3656.66: So none is set aside for any other. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3657.96-3665.39: And beyond that, the core capex is the H5H that maybe you made reference to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3666.25-3668.35: TikTok effects for 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3669.15-3678.52: When you check it on the IFRS 16 was 1.489 and on the IAS 17 is 1.397. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3679.32-3685.95: So that is our cassette details. So all of them are capitalized within the 2020 year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3689.17-3694.25: And just to add that the difference between the core and the total will be things like licenses, right, Kobi? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3695.40-3700.32: Licenses and software that are related to network. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3704.24-3713.65: Sorry, can you clarify on the CapEx question? So, the number that I saw was... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3714.71-3720.00: It was, even when you add the licenses and what not, it was still only just over 1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3723.42-3732.75: Yes, over. Because we have spectrums as well as core network assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3733.89-3741.32: The spectrums were about 360 million, so those ads plus other software and licenses. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3742.88-3750.11: So maybe we have to look at what you are looking at and give you better clarity, but let's look. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3751.39-3760.34: And just one quick follow up on that is how much of your CapEx would you consider to be growth CapEx relative to maintenance CapEx? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3763.10-3771.89: Come again, I didn't quite catch what you said. How much of your back is would you consider maintenance of the existing network versus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3774.93-3779.92: Maintenance maintenance are treated as opaque so maintenance doesn't form part of KPAC. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3781.76-3790.65: But I think to clarify, I think the question is, you know, we have maintenance CAPEX, which would be, we need to implement that to keep the network going with the existing capacity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3791.19-3792.75: And then there's incremental cost and cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3794.17-3796.46: Adding capacity to existing networks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3797.48-3804.24: Yeah. Perhaps we can take that offline and look at the breakdown, if I may suggest that. Yeah. That's what I suggested. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3804.62-3810.09: So maybe we'll pick it up. Jeremiah, take notes and then let's get back to him on the details. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3812.83-3814.03: Thank you, appreciate it. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3819.48-3823.00: Do you have any closing comments? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3825.31-3833.27: So I'd like to thank everyone for making time to join us today for this call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3833.89-3840.32: Again, I would like to apologize for the long hold at the start of the call. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3840.34-3844.12: Extension of the time of the call as a result of this food. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3845.13-3849.69: I know there are quite a number of questions in the queue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3850.71-3858.90: But I'll be glad if you can reach out to me and then I can assist you with your answer questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3859.76-3868.63: And you can also visit the investor page on our website, that's ntn.com.gh to download our financials and assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3868.65-3871.65: Any other relevant investor information.

asr:0: OUTPUT 3879.74-3881.74: So thank you and you may now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3887.09-3893.29: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines. 
asr:0: END
