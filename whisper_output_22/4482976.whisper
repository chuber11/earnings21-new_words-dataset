asr:0: OUTPUT 31.89-41.30: Thanks very much. Good morning to everyone and thank you for dialing in today. With me on the call is Stephen Wells, our Chief Financial Officer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 41.32-47.25: And Viren Veera, GM of Business Development and Investor Relations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 48.03-59.86: Today SARA released its December 2021 quarterly results covering operations, market conditions, the Vidalia project and the outlook for natural graphite, active anode material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 59.88-62.52: And its end-use market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 63.32-69.17: The fourth quarter and 2021 as a whole was an extraordinarily important period for CSIRO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 69.19-74.23: Repositioning the company at a transformative point for the industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 75.03-82.86: Market conditions in the upstream market are the strongest they have been since the LARMers commencement in 2017. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 82.88-91.45: With very strong momentum in demand growth, the existence of supply interruptions and rising prices for natural graphite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 92.29-96.30: The electric vehicle market has shown remarkable growth through 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 97.10-106.91: With sales doubling year on year to more than 6 million units, monthly global EV sales exceeding 800,000 units for the first time in December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 107.73-112.25: And global EV penetration reaching approximately 8%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 113.07-115.30: Growth is expected to be sustained. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 115.40-124.92: And this is driving significant EV and battery manufacturing expansion announcements and capital programs in our downstream target markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 124.94-133.55: And the concurrent gap is evident in localised supply of input materials in the US and in Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 134.77-140.56: Cyrus signing during the quarter of a fixed volume and price offtake agreement with Tesla. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 140.58-151.59: For active anode material from the Vidae facility in the US, marked the importance of CSIRES integrated business in potentially starting to fill a part of that gap. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 152.33-160.96: And all around the world, governments and markets recognise the key role of critical minerals such as graphite in automotive electrification. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 160.98-166.83: And energy storage development towards the objective of reducing carbon emissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 167.79-172.85: Positive ESG differentiation also continues to rise in importance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 172.95-178.88: Greater understanding sees challenges in parts of the existing battery materials supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 179.82-190.17: Each quarter we reiterate our belief in the importance of the Balarma asset and our vertically integrated active anode material facility at Bedalia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 190.47-199.98: To the future of this transition and as 2021 closed, we saw that this is becoming more apparent to customers, investors and governments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 201.46-209.05: Whilst it's disappointing that disruption in the global container shipping industry constrained alarmant production and sales in recent months,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 209.71-214.33: We have developed major logistics options to reduce the future impacts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 214.35-223.94: And heading into 2022 with strong optimism around the llama's future and the potential for near-term FID approval at Cydalia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 225.59-231.35: Slide four reiterates our fundamental ESG commitments and performance focus. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 231.37-236.10: And every quarter that passes highlights the criticality of this effort. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 236.96-246.49: Since the company's commencement, ESG excellence has been a key focus and we're beginning to see the very real impact of downstream customer requirements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 246.51-253.97: And supply chain auditing bring differentiation between incumbent production and ourselves into sharp relief. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 254.91-269.75: During Q4, Minviro completed a detailed independent lifecycle assessment of CSIRA's integrated operations from Balarma Origin to Vidalia Active Anode Material customer gates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 269.77-271.75: In accordance with ISO standards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 272.89-278.70: LTA is a globally recognised and scientifically validated methodology. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 278.72-285.99: To quantify direct and embodied environmental impacts along the life cycle of a product or process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 286.03-295.54: And Minvaro is an independent third party consultant with an established track record of life cycle assessment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 295.56-297.62: In the battery material space. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 298.64-310.93: The approach incorporates all material and energy inputs and direct emissions to air, land and water associated with the production of a product or process and identifies environmental hotspots. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 310.95-314.05: In the production process by an assessment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 314.07-317.28: Of an overall global warming potential outcome. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 318.12-325.43: Minvaro's LCA estimated that SARA's operations exhibit materially lower global warming potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 325.61-333.23: Compared with representative natural graphite and synthetic graphite anode material suppliers benchmarks in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 334.15-340.62: The company is also advancing specific projects including a solar and battery system at Goolama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 340.64-347.33: And longer term power options for Vidalia to further reduce the environmental impact of these operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 348.21-354.85: It's worth noting here that a lot of partial chain information is being communicated to the market around LCA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 356.16-364.56: CSIRO is committed to making the full chain from mine to final product visible and encourages care to be taken in making comparisons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.58-372.59: To ensure that definitions are not being cherry-picked to derive a particular desired result by others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 373.85-381.24: Specifically moving on to ESG outcomes for the quarter, our health, safety and environment performance remains outstanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 381.32-385.41: Our triffer at the Lama was 0.5 in the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 385.89-390.97: And the Balaamutrepa has remained below 1 since late 2018. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 391.59-396.42: Our trek route Vidalia was again zero in the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 397.96-406.11: We recorded a number of further positive COVID-19 cases at the Lama late in the quarter after around two months with no new cases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 406.85-412.01: All cases were minor or no symptoms and there's been no impact on operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 412.69-420.16: SARA has robust COVID-19 protocols in place and these allow us to effectively manage the Lama without interruption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 420.90-431.45: CSIRO has also made available and promoted vaccination, and now 97% of employees and contractors are vaccinated at Burama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 432.15-436.92: Companies also supporting vaccination efforts in its host communities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 438.86-449.61: We'll skip over the quarterly summary slide and go straight to the detail and I'll hand over to Steve here to make some comments on the market and corporate position. Steve? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 451.57-453.15: Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 454.29-459.30: As Sean noted, 2021 was a watershed year for EV production and sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 460.00-466.25: Huge number of legacy automaker programs and model announcements demonstrating mainstream integration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 467.59-472.33: Slide 6 shows our primary leading indicator, global electric vehicle sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 473.07-477.88: Very positive momentum, continued in EV sales and penetration in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 478.64-484.44: Global EV sales grew 115% in 2021 versus 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 484.64-490.07: To approximately 6.2 million units with strong demand growth in China, Europe and the US. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 491.07-496.20: Global EV sales were more than 850,000 units in December 2021 alone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 496.68-502.06: A staggering outcome when compared to full year results of just over 2 million units only two years ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.96-512.39: Most analysts project further strong increases across all major geographies in 2022 and beyond, supported by growing consumer adoption and government policy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 514.11-519.86: EV sales and battery demand growth are obviously causing strong momentum to flow through the demand for anode material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 520.42-528.29: As demonstrated by total Chinese active anode material production increasing to a record 71,000 tonnes in December 2016. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 528.77-534.11: And Q4 representing an almost 50% increase on the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 535.44-544.26: The trend on this front has been very strong over the past 18 months and our interaction with spherical graphite processes in China demonstrates very robust demand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 545.15-550.41: Mr Maringrae has considered some supply headwinds with both artificial graphite and natural graphite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.43-555.80: AIM's supply in China being impacted by production challenges which has reduced inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 557.34-560.00: In the case of synthetic graphite active anode material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 560.58-570.23: The impact of power disruptions, rising power prices and an increased focus on emissions in Q4 reduced availability and increased price on the synthetic products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 571.03-572.99: And as highlighted on slide seven. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 573.03-581.32: The upstream natural raffia fines market has seen strong demand conditions coincide with supply disruption amongst Chinese domestic producers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 582.82-587.17: Major Chinese production sources have been impacted by environmental restrictions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 587.21-598.02: Including tailings challenges, air and effluent emissions, as well as seeing the same power cost and disruption challenges that have impacted the synthetic graphite active anode material producers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 599.76-609.23: These domestic Chinese market dynamics have coincided with the annual winter domestic production average period, resulting in very low natural graphite inventories. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 609.75-617.86: Exacerbated by import challenges caused by disruptions in the global shipping market and China logistics disruptions from COVID lockdowns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 618.76-623.68: As a result, third party price reporting agencies are recording significant increases. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 623.70-631.67: In Chinese domestic natural graphite science prices as demonstrated by the 2021 spot price chart on slide 7. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.53-637.48: It is important to note that SARA's weighted average price achieved may not reflect this spot price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 637.50-643.80: As it includes prices for sales under a mix of spot and term contracts and different pricing mechanisms. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 644.52-650.51: We are, however, seeing contracted prices increasingly strong for new deals and spot shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 652.13-659.48: Slide 89 provides the latest picture of the global and relevant regional battery manufacturing capacity pipeline forecast and announcements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 660.02-664.14: As well as the resultant graphite battery anode material forecast requirements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 665.15-674.53: The growth ahead for the industry continues to strengthen, in particular for CSIRA's Chinese natural graphite target customers and the USA Acumen material market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 675.18-683.88: Providing a very strong backdrop for the company to increase production capacity utilization of Bollama and a great setting for Vidalia's potential initial expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 685.69-695.62: Moving now to the corporate front, Syra finished the quarter and the year with a cash balance of $53 million compared to $74 million at the end of Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 695.80-701.86: Given the confidence in progressing with the daily construction in the near term and to maintain the expected project schedule,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 701.96-707.75: We continue to invest in detailed engineering activities and procurement of long lead items at the DALIA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 708.71-716.02: SPARRA also completed the purchase of an adjacent parcel of land that will facilitate construction activities for Bodavia's initial expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 716.32-721.30: As well as provide the required space to potentially expand the facility further as the market grows. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 722.10-725.17: The total amount of the daily investment through the quarter was $6 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 726.99-731.03: With shipping constraints causing lower production of sales than anticipated by Lama. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 731.53-736.08: We were not able to achieve our minimum 15,000 tonnes per month production target. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 736.60-742.26: And there were also several one-off items through the quarter, including a 13 pay cheque for local Mosem Beacon staff. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 743.26-749.63: We have also extended our procurement working capital cycle to ensure we are not impacted by any challenges for production inputs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.05-753.77: While sweeping transit times to the extended IR receivables collection timeframes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 754.37-756.68: Funds continue to be received just later. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 758.04-766.81: Similarly, there is a lag between higher shipping costs being incurred at present and increased pricing on tonnes being shipped compared to what we are experiencing on new orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 767.43-775.98: However this will balance out and there is strong upward pricing pressure through the order book which will more than compensate for the shipping price increases we have seen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 777.30-784.38: Over the short and medium term, we would see shipping costs stabilising and beginning to moderate should the shipping market normalise. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 784.64-788.81: While current price support for natural graphite based on market factors is very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 790.03-797.76: In the current market, they are also likely to achieve prepayment of natural graphite sales through break bulk shipments, which will also improve working capital. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.04-808.87: In current with the Bodonia FIT processes SARA continues to review funding requirements for the initial expansion and is engaged with government agencies relevant to critical minerals development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 809.53-817.96: As a result of these initiatives and of the daily production of cake work, corporate costs were also higher than normal during the quarter. I'll now hand you back to Sean. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 820.20-832.01: Thanks Steve and starting on slide 10 through to 14 we move to the Lama production sales and logistics performance in Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 832.91-842.80: Whilst disappointing that the global container shipping industry disruption continues to constrain production and sales, there are two critical takeaways beneath the headlines. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 843.22-846.85: Firstly, plant performance in the second half of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 846.89-853.51: Was better than in any prior period, benefiting from ongoing incremental improvement programs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 853.93-862.28: And secondly, we worked through a major option for alleviation of the shipping constraints from the first quarter of 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 863.54-871.31: December 2021 quarter production was constrained by maximum inventory positions early in the quarter at Boolama and Nakala. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 871.81-881.64: And the continual promises of improvement in container shipping market disruption taking longer than expected to eventuate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 882.10-885.39: This forced us to critically evaluate the alternatives. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 885.41-892.45: And has led to the development of an additional break bulk shipment option which I'll speak to further in a moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 895.64-903.32: And that improvement is expected to materially improve production and sales from the March 2022 quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 903.96-915.04: At the Lama, 13,000 tonnes of natural graphite was produced at 82% recovery and 19,000 tonnes sold during the December 2021 quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 915.64-922.38: All 20,000 tonnes of finished product inventory at the conclusion of the quarter was contracted to customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.50-928.15: And in fact, much of that has since been cleared with a strong start to 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 929.47-938.92: Product quality was consistent with previous quarters with stable recovery in grade and we achieved a record 89% recovery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 938.98-941.40: In campaign operations during December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 942.06-952.99: Our strong operational performance demonstrated during campaign production runs in the quarter saw us produce at an average daily production run rate of 16,000 tonnes per month pro rata. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 953.27-958.72: And a maximum daily production rate of 24,000 tonnes per month pro rata. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 959.16-965.45: So we have strong confidence in increasing the line of production with continuous operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 966.37-977.36: Our C1 cash costs of US $1,159 a tonne for the quarter is reflective of a fixed cost base and low production level for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 978.10-987.31: The line of C1 cash cost guidance is at US$430 to $470 a tonne at a 15,000 tonne per month production run rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 987.97-995.62: The alarm at unit costs are expected to reduce materially as the production rate increases beyond 15,000 tonnes per minute. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.16-1007.67: During the quarter, planned maintenance was also brought forward and optimisation work was completed with sustaining capital and CSF development spending of around $2.2 million for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1007.97-1013.37: Giving us a strong open run at consistent production as inventory levels clear. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1014.71-1020.72: On slide 13 we move to some further detail on the sales side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1021.48-1032.31: Starting Q4 with more than 45,000 tonnes of sales orders, Cyrus sold and shipped 19,000 tonnes of natural graphite, constrained by the ongoing disruption in the container market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1032.79-1042.08: And primarily the inability to secure sufficient container capacity for BALAMA products on vessels sailing from Nacala to meet prevailing demands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1042.98-1056.64: Given the China market conditions that Steve mentioned previously, we are seeing exceptionally strong demand and poor contracting with end user customers and we're currently sitting with more than 80,000 tonnes of sales orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.66-1059.44: For the March quarter and backlog to work through. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1060.12-1067.55: The weighted average sales price increased to US $530 a tonne here from the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1067.59-1074.05: And further price support is evident in course in fines markets post quarter end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1074.59-1080.58: New sales are being contracted at higher prices than achieved in the December 2021 quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1081.50-1087.53: Fine sales accounted for approximately 80% of overall product sales during the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1087.67-1096.70: And the fines market is for the first time consistently exhibiting stronger price growth momentum than the course market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1098.68-1110.85: Chinese natural graphite supply disruption and the challenges in the shipping market severely affected Chinese inventory and restocking of natural graphite ahead of the seasonal winter production outages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1110.87-1115.12: And tight market conditions are expected to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1116.32-1127.77: Container shipping availability is expected to improve through this quarter with additional capacity being added and lower seasonal competition expected from the agricultural sector out of Mozambique. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1128.47-1134.17: Ongoing China port disruption from COVID lockdowns does remain a possible challenge. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.52-1146.09: So whilst SAR expects container shipping availability to improve, we've taken action to improve sales and alleviate the inventory constraint on production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1146.53-1156.96: And slide 14 outlines a major new logistics option that we have developed to commence break-off shipments through Pembroke Port. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1158.52-1168.63: Breakbox shipments will provide an additional export route for SARA, enabling three things, flexibility in managing inventory between Balaama, Nakala and Pemba. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1169.23-1178.18: Secondly, significantly higher alarm of product sales and could be achieved solely through Nacala port in containers at present. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.64-1186.57: And then thirdly, higher production rates at the Lama facilitating more than 15,000 tonnes a month of production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.29-1192.33: Our first 10,000 tonne breakwater shipment from Pemba to China is scheduled in early February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1193.29-1199.48: And we have significant further customer demand for such shipments which have a shorter transit time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1199.84-1207.23: Less likelihood of delay impacts of load and discharge, and an improved payment profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1208.59-1213.37: Timber is approximately half the distance of Nacala from Balama by road. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.45-1222.56: And SARA's integrated logistics service provider is providing transport, port and customs services for exports from Pember. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1222.58-1225.53: With additional warehousing contractors added. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1226.73-1234.63: The combination of Nacala container shipments and Penwood break bulk is expected to materially increase export sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1235.94-1241.90: And alleviate the inventory constraints previously impacting the llama production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1244.14-1249.17: Moving on to Vidalia on slides 15, 16 and 17. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1249.37-1258.32: We are well progressed in the processes to facilitate a final investment decision on the Vidalia initial expansion in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.00-1265.17: We were very pleased in late Q4 to announce the offtake agreement executed with Tesla. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1265.19-1276.18: To supply 8,000 tonnes of active anode material per annum from Verdalia at a fixed price for an initial term of four years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1276.82-1283.84: This agreement underpins SARA's movement into the final phase of assessment for the initial Fidelio expansion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1283.94-1290.39: And also contains an option for additional volumes supporting evaluation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1290.41-1298.16: There are further expansion beyond the initial phase consistent with the market growth and announcements that we've talked about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1299.20-1309.03: Ongoing commercial and technical interactions demonstrate strong interest from other target customers in the remaining volumes and our future plans at Vidalia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.05-1318.96: And are providing strong motivation for SARI to assess a potential accelerated, larger expansion at Bedelia beyond the initial expansion projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1319.88-1332.19: Deepfield Engineering of the Vidalia initial expansion project is 50% completed and has supported the technology, design and operating assumptions in the Bankable Feasibility Study from 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1333.09-1347.59: In addition, the detailed engineering and critical long lead equipment procurement completed to date is continuing to build readiness to proceed to construction subject to a final investment decision being made. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1349.39-1357.58: With US $79 million of capital invested to date in Batalea's operations and project development,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1357.60-1360.50: And the continuing development of the value chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1361.00-1368.71: The de-risking of CSIRO's entry into the downstream active anode material market continues towards the investment decision. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1369.43-1370.61: As far as we are aware. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1370.65-1390.65: We remain the furthest progressed of any company in the development of an ex-China vertically integrated source of natural graphite active anode material, leveraging the size, strength and operating history of Belana with an established facility and customer supported initial construction at the day year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1391.45-1404.10: We're pleased to have reached this stage as supply chains are under increased scrutiny and pressure and we expect to communicate further around FID in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1405.27-1409.97: To conclude on slide 18, Sarah is very positive about the period ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1410.51-1421.10: EV sales growth, a constructive demand environment for anode material and Chinese supply disruption are driving strong demand and pricing for Bulama products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.00-1424.84: Increased shipping optionality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1424.88-1433.03: Release of inventory, constraints and strong demand should facilitate increasing alarm of production beyond 15,000 tonnes per month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1433.05-1435.70: And enable higher sales volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1437.16-1444.52: And continuation of our FID and financing processes are seeing this working toward a potential FID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1444.54-1452.09: For initial expansion with active anode material and for failure in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1452.85-1458.74: The current market and CSIRO's progress demonstrate the unique position we occupy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.02-1463.50: With the largest global integrated natural graphite operation at Paloma. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1464.76-1472.21: And the most advanced option for vertically integrated supply of natural graphite activated material outside Asia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1473.91-1480.00: We look forward to keeping you up to date with the company's progress. And with that we'll move across to questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.96-1490.43: Thank you. We'll now begin the question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question today, please press star 1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.97-1499.18: If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pounder hash key. Please note there might be a slight pause to ask questions to you. Once again, it is Star 1, and we wait for your name to be announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1499.54-1508.85: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sol Featherneck from Credit Suisse. Sol, please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.19-1513.19: Hi, Jen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1513.47-1521.38: Just a couple of quick questions if I may, particularly regarding just the scope for shipping the improvements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.40-1523.54: Perhaps just for some clarity here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1524.92-1533.35: Understand the break bulk you're referring to, the break-bulk option you're referring to, is that just the PEMB report or is that also an option you're pursuing at McCulloch? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1533.75-1541.54: Possible to just give some further color on the potential scale of the volumes you could be getting out of TAMBO over the next six months? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1543.42-1544.48: I'm going to show a clip. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1544.56-1554.21: Apologies for my lack of voice at the end there. I was just recovering from being unwell last week. So we'll see how we go. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1556.94-1561.56: With regards to BreakBlock, certainly the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1561.74-1568.89: The initial plans that we have in place are out of tender. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.33-1577.22: There is the possibility of break bulk operations out of Nacala, but one of the issues at Nacala at the moment is ongoing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1577.24-1585.43: On-going congestion, which is part of the issue for container shipments as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1587.83-1595.14: The initial plan is very much through PEMBA. We've got good plans and set up in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1596.22-1604.74: We'll see how the first shipments go and we'll provide some further guidance around potential later volumes as we move ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1608.35-1616.58: If I could probe in this way, you talk about a 10,000 tonne breakout shipment for PEMBA in February. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1620.32-1629.17: So to my mind that could indicate that we could get your 15KT run rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1629.43-1632.69: Almost entirely out of 10 bar if things progressed well there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1633.65-1640.02: Would that be a fair inference? Are all things going well? Temper capacity could meet or even exceed the colour? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1642.74-1649.57: As I said, we'll see how things progress, but certainly the combination of the two is pretty powerful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1649.75-1656.50: And Nacala continues to be very important for us now and in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.44-1661.66: We have a number of customers who take different sizes of shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1662.84-1668.61: And we need to be able to service folks, but certainly putting PEMBA and NACARLA together. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1669.69-1674.79: Is a pretty powerful combination of lifting volumes beyond 15,000 tonnes a month for sure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1677.16-1682.90: Thanks. And one last clarification. When you refer to kind of this spot volume out of 10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.38-1687.79: That's just referring to the port that's still going into the same contract. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1688.47-1690.81: Is that correct or is this also going to a different market? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1692.81-1699.62: We are doing most of the grapevine shipments into the stock market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1701.18-1710.87: Because they are under different logistics conditions, they are separate contracts and obviously priced accordingly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1712.93-1714.15: Understood. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1714.19-1723.18: We might try my luck here, but can you give us any indication of what kind of spread, the difference in price you're getting with those spot volumes versus contract volumes? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1725.11-1726.95: You know is waking in at that 5.30. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1728.31-1736.48: No, we've made some commentary there about the December quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.50-1740.74: Rate of average price being at $5.30 and obviously the spot shipment being $5.50. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1740.76-1747.23: Apart from that, I'm strengthening significantly so I'll leave it at that. Great, thank you very much. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1750.65-1756.24: Our next telephone question is from the line of Mark Pichera from Foster Stock Broking. Mark, please ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1757.76-1760.52: Hi Sean, just a couple of questions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.02-1763.48: Firstly on the FID, Sir Zedalia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1763.96-1771.37: I was, obviously earlier you previously said you were looking at FID by the end of this month. Now you're stating in the near term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1771.79-1780.62: I was just wondering what the reasoning is there for, I guess, the slight delay. And when you say new term,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1780.64-1785.31: I gather is this in the current quarter and that would it be early or late this quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1785.77-1791.19: And then my second question is on the life cycle assessment you mentioned and the quarterly data. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1791.21-1799.92: Third-party critical reviews yet to be undertaken. What are your thoughts there in terms of when you think you'll make this third-party review and who would likely do it? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1800.00-1801.30: Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1803.36-1807.71: Thanks Mark, so with regard to the FID. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1808.11-1817.18: The technical, commercial, operational and funding elements of the FID review, the processes around them are well underway and progressing well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1817.26-1820.94: We recognised we communicated and targeted January but the process was not as smooth as we'd hoped. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.98-1822.28: This is not completed yet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1823.14-1831.71: We will advise when they are complete. They're expected to be completed in the near term and certainly you can read that as within this quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1833.03-1840.62: And there's no specific issues we're dealing with on that front, we're just working through the process to ensure we bring the best possible project to execution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1842.58-1849.25: With regard to the MINDIRO LTA assessment,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1850.69-1859.66: The potential for third party independent review of the assessment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1859.74-1868.71: Really then provides the potential for an additional amount of disclosure around specific comparison points. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1869.87-1893.69: One of the things that, we've mentioned this previously on prior calls, is that this really is an emerging area. We've taken the most detailed and transparent approach that we could to the full chain from Balama Gate to, or Balama Origin to customer gates out of Bedalia. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1894.73-1899.86: And we are waiting, I think, as well as doing the third party review. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1899.90-1903.18: To see how others. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1903.20-1910.27: Are continuing to describe these processes and making sure that the comparison points are fair and valid. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1910.37-1920.62: So we'll work through that in conjunction with MinVarro but we're really pleased with what we're seeing so far in terms of the general comparisons compared to China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1922.98-1932.87: Right. And just a follow through on that, Sean, is this I guess a key selling point in terms of some of the potential offtakers in terms of wanting to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1933.27-1939.92: See that LCA in terms of making a decision, especially given the ESG somatics. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1943.20-1944.22: Yeah, exactly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1944.24-1953.53: But certainly all potential customers who are engaged with us around Vidalia ESCs is a key. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1953.61-1958.34: Focus area for them as is supply diversification, as is quality and cost. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.36-1967.15: This significant level of detail is something that we are able to disclose to them under those processes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1968.21-1972.51: And certainly it's been very helpful on the way through so far in that differentiation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.97-1981.70: Thanks. And just a reminder, it is a Star One to ask a telephone question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1982.02-1986.25: Our next telephone question is from Lynn Loco from Barron Joey. Please ask your question, Lynn. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1988.01-1995.40: Good morning. Firstly I just want you to talk to me a little bit more about the 80,000 tonnes of sales orders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1996.04-1999.98: Mean that's you know over 25,000 a month of production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2000.60-2010.65: I mean, is that, you've got to deliver that or, you know, how does that work? I mean, is that just what you've got and that's for delivery over the next six months and nine months? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2010.69-2015.36: Just trying to square the circle between MathCommon and your production rate at the moment. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2017.34-2027.33: The production rate has been constrained by the inventory position so obviously that's been key in developing the brake bulk option. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2028.13-2029.17: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2029.21-2036.54: 80,000 tonnes of sales orders ahead of it, so a mix of previously contracted,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2036.56-2041.42: Term contracts and spot sales have been made over. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.44-2042.60: Prior months. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2042.64-2052.25: And even more recently in anticipation of clearing some of the shipping issues. And of course, as I said earlier,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2052.51-2059.52: The new spot break off shipments being done under new terms as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2059.86-2063.46: We are endeavouring to work through the backlog. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2063.56-2067.01: As quickly as possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2067.03-2074.91: Essentially willing to take the material even though it's been delayed. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2074.99-2077.74: Because market conditions are incredibly tight. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2077.84-2083.12: Not just in China but more broadly across the global market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2084.86-2093.79: So Sean, are you aiming to sell or ship 80,000 tonnes and if you can get the logistics changed to work? Is that the inference from that comment? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2095.88-2107.01: Yes, certainly we're looking to get up above 15,000 tonnes as quickly as possible and to be clearing through that backlog of sales orders for sure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2108.19-2119.30: We will have to continue booking new sales in conjunction with clearing that backlog because. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2119.32-2122.48: The break vault process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2122.50-2125.83: It gives us that opportunity to mix the two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2126.43-2132.65: To be able to clear the backlog and continue to participate in the current market. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2134.61-2144.48: Sorry, maybe I'm just a bit slow, but even if you sell your product inventory at 20, that leaves you 60 which is $20,000 a month. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2144.84-2151.01: Is that sort of, you know, if this sort of sales orders continue and you get another 80,000 tons for the June quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2151.91-2160.62: You've got to start pushing your business towards 20 a month in terms of over 20 a month in production and hopefully logistics change. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2161.08-2163.78: Stacks up but it sounds like logistics is your bottleneck. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2164.30-2172.73: And your business needs to run at 20,000 plus, 25,000 a month if you can get the logistics chain to work. Is that what you're trying to tell us? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2173.89-2176.14: Yeah, otherwise backlog persists. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2176.18-2185.73: So clearly we're trying to work through that backlog and have the logistics chain support us increasing production. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2185.75-2192.15: As quickly as possible to work through the backlog and continue to satisfy new stock demands. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.27-2200.16: So yes, that's what we're saying. We're looking to try to lift that production rate as soon as possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2200.40-2202.54: Senate Logistics Support Executive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2203.88-2210.41: It is at 80,000 tonnes and if logistics train doesn't come through and you ship it in the June quarter, in the September quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2211.11-2215.30: Are they priced on today or is it priced on delivery? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2216.08-2225.97: Because obviously the price in six months time could be much higher and we just don't want to be thinking you're getting this big price lift on orders that were placed yesterday. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2227.03-2238.78: The weighted average price is a mix of pricing mechanisms, some of which were fixed at the time contracts were put in place, some of which are more related to the timing of shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2239.86-2248.27: There will always be a lag and a difference between spot market price assessments and what our weighted average looks like across. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.29-2252.79: And as well as the timing of brass being settled. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.35-2257.38: So that is a clear strategy that we've had in place. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2257.40-2264.22: To ensure that we have a mix of mechanisms and a mix of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2264.24-2266.05: Of different contract types. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.91-2275.56: So that we're not fully exposed to changes one way or the other in price all at the same time with every counterparty. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.40-2283.90: That's clear. And just the difference between the break bulk out of PEMBA and containers out of the CARLA. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2284.50-2293.79: You're selling everything on a CAF basis. Can you talk to me about the freight differential, shipping brake bolt versus container? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2293.83-2297.40: How that market's looking at the moment, the two freight rates. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2300.00-2307.79: Both shipping markets have been elevated, there's no doubt about that. The single biggest issue for us has been the constraint of availability. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.75-2311.35: Overwrite because. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2311.37-2323.06: Stock market prices were increasing for the product faster than freight rates, and we just couldn't get enough... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2323.08-2329.59: Capacity out of Nacala. So clearly the economics around breakballs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2329.79-2330.79: A different. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.15-2337.02: The cost structures are different, we have a shorter landlord who sticks legs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2337.36-2346.39: Different contracting requirements around warehousing, stevedoring, etc. Compared to container packing, that those economics have been taken into account. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2346.81-2348.75: At the moment it makes economic sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2349.23-2356.84: From a freight rate perspective and the overall logistics costs to be undertaking these types of shipments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2358.76-2363.44: And one very positive thing about this is if... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2363.46-2369.13: If it evolves successfully, it opens up greater logistics opportunity for us in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2369.55-2377.20: And it gives us exposure to slightly different cycles that occur through bulk shipping markets and container shipping markets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2377.22-2381.00: Could be very useful to us as we continue in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.54-2388.77: Can you put a quantum around one versus the other, great bulk shipping versus container, what's the dollar per ton figure? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.65-2392.95: Well what we've said so far around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2394.21-2403.14: The container freight rates on a per tonne basis is that most of them have more than doubled through this period of disruption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2403.44-2408.39: Some time ago we were talking about an average of around $50 a tonne. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2409.79-2411.07: On a container basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.13-2416.02: It's significantly above $100. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2416.08-2417.74: On average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2418.22-2425.75: Across our destination suite, and the component of. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.77-2427.75: Bright dog, bright. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2427.79-2436.44: It's not directly comparable because of the other logistics costs, but at the moment it's certainly competitive with those levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2438.88-2440.68: And then just one final question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2441.16-2445.73: Just inventory, obviously sounds like graphite inventory is quite low but. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2445.81-2455.34: Do you have any visibility and sense on your customers inventory of anodes and even batteries in the chain or do you think the whole chain is quite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.36-2456.94: Quite low. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2458.98-2468.95: I wouldn't comment too much on the battery side, but certainly on the anode side, you've got a situation where production rates are at record levels in China. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2470.15-2475.42: You have constraints on input raw material supply. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2476.52-2481.58: You have constraints on production capacity utilisation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2481.86-2489.47: In the strange situation where the Chinese anode material producers have actually produced at record levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2490.65-2493.53: But to do so, they'd have to push really hard. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2493.83-2504.30: To satisfy demands downstream and in doing so they've really put pressure on their raw materials inventory. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2504.88-2512.83: I think there is potential challenge there in terms of availability of energy material. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2513.91-2520.92: As we head into 2022 on a couple of those factors around power, power disruption. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2520.94-2525.49: Availability of input material from the natural graphite site. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2527.31-2536.70: Anecdotally of course we hear the pressure from the cell supply side that's being caused by both cathode materials and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2536.72-2540.12: Now starting to come through on the anodic material side. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2542.16-2544.78: Okay, thanks very much, Sean. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.39-2551.31: There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to hand the conference back to Mr. Schoenwerder for closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2553.69-2560.20: Thanks to everyone for the attention today and as I said we look forward to keeping everybody up to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.44-2566.03: And as we work through our final investment decision processes for Bedelia.
