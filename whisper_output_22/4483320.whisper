asr:0: START
asr:0: OUTPUT 8.67-11.27: Hello, good afternoon or good morning, wherever you might be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 11.63-20.70: Welcome to the London Energy Q4 2021 results and also the 2022 business outlook and budget for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 21.50-24.78: We'll run today like a normal set of results, actually. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 25.33-29.19: We will have Nick Walker talk to the top line, some operational highlights. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 29.63-38.32: And then we'll hand over to Dan Fitzgerald who will talk you through the operations and then over to Tita Poulsen who will talk you through the financial performance for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 38.40-41.08: And an outlook into 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 42.12-51.55: After that, we'll be followed by the Q&A. And we'll run it by the conference call line first, Q&A. And then I'll host the calls from the web thereafter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 52.21-56.90: So thanks for joining, and I'll hand over to Nick Walker, who'll kick off the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 59.82-64.20: Thank you, Ed, and good afternoon or good morning if you're joining us from North America. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 64.76-73.47: It's great to have you all join our Lundin Energy's 2021 results discussion and our 2022 business outlook. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 74.07-77.58: Of course, given the transaction we announced with AkaBP in December. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 78.06-85.11: The format today is naturally slightly different to our usual capital markets day. And as Ed says, I'll give an overview and then. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 85.13-91.77: Give an insight into the Acapi-P transaction and then we'll run through the agenda. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 91.79-96.16: As usual, we'll give you the opportunities to answer your questions at the end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 98.66-106.79: So first of all, the key highlights for 2021. I'm really pleased to report record production and record financial results for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 107.47-116.06: This is underpinned by continued excellent operating performance and, of course, the strong oil and gas prices that we're enjoying today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 117.36-127.23: You can see our world-class assets continue to outperform. Full-year production, you can see, came in at 190,000 BOEs per day. That's top of the original guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 127.83-131.53: And we exited the year at just under 200,000 BOEs per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 133.97-135.84: All of our key projects are on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 136.48-144.18: In the Greater Ebbwig area we delivered an infield drilling programme and we delivered two tie-back projects to the facilities, Solvay and Rolsenes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 144.46-148.35: And all of those projects came in on budget and on schedule. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 149.05-154.63: And together with a number of new projects that are being planned, will keep the facilities full in the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 156.08-164.84: Jons Federer at phase two remains firmly on schedule for first oil later this year, which will provide a big boost to our production, as you'll see when Dan talks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 165.55-169.99: And we have two projects in the Alvheim area just started in the execution phase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 171.09-176.24: We again grew the business with a resource replacement ratio last year of 200%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 176.88-184.38: I see more to come from continued growth in our world-class assets and I think Dan will give you a flavor for that when he talks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 186.91-191.49: Our high-quality cash-generative business delivered record financial results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 192.29-198.54: You can see continuing industry-leading low operating costs of $3.1 per BOE in the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 199.42-208.69: We generated record free cash flow on the back of strong production performance and strong prices of $1.6 billion for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 208.73-218.06: That's over three times our annual dividends and results in us deleveraging the business with net debt reduced to $2.7 billion at the year-end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 219.66-227.73: We're also making great progress on our decarbonisation plan, with the company set to be carbon neutral by 2023 from operational emissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 228.21-234.45: And I see this as a key value differentiator for Lundin Energy and supports our top quartile ESG ratings. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 235.72-241.20: And this is the foundation of our recent inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for Europe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 241.52-246.43: And I think this is a big deal. It's one of the biggest accolades you can get in relation to ESG. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 247.69-253.67: So in summary, we've delivered excellent results in 2021 and all of our key business priorities are on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 254.81-263.80: But also at the end of last year, I was very pleased that we announced a transaction where we're combining Lundin Energy's E&P business with Aker BP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 263.82-267.51: To create the leading European independent E&P company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 267.97-270.29: And I'll talk about that in a few moments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 273.63-282.52: But first, looking forward to what can you expect in 2022. You can see we're guiding production of 180 to 200,000 BOEs per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 283.18-291.93: And that's consistent with what we've indicated previously, with the main variable being the timing of the start-up of Jons Fedrup phase two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 292.87-296.86: As I've discussed, we're set to be carbon neutral by the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 297.76-303.76: And we continue to sustain low operating costs, $3.6 per barrel is the guidance for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 304.20-307.09: That's slightly above 2021 levels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 307.33-316.84: But that's due to start-up phase of Johans Fedrup. And when we get to a full year of production on Johans Fedrup phase two, then it drops down again in 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 318.60-324.16: In terms of operational delivery, you'll see that Johans Federer phase two comes online in the fourth quarter of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 324.66-330.61: Lifting capacity through the field to 755,000 barrels of oil per day. Gross. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 331.71-340.20: At Evergreig, we expect to see three new project sanctions by the end of the year supporting this long-term production plateau extension. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 340.98-344.86: And electrification of the facilities will start up later in the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 345.15-348.43: And this is, of course, a key element to our decarbonisation plan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 349.97-358.30: And at the large Whisting field, where we increased our interest last year to 35%, we will sanction that project development at the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 358.74-363.48: And this provides material support to the long-term production outlook for the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 364.76-371.99: And of course, during the year, we expect the transaction with Akabipi to complete around the middle of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 374.19-379.76: And on the back of that strong performance and the outlook for the business, and as we announced at the end of last year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 379.78-386.77: The Board is recommending to the 2022 AGM a quarterly dividend increase by 25% from this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 387.29-395.12: So, on an annual basis, that's $2.25 per share, which will be paid quarterly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 395.90-399.82: This is in line with our dividend policy to grow shareholder returns. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 400.46-407.25: And this increased dividend level will remain payable until closure of the Akka BP transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 408.25-415.03: And I now intend to run through a couple of slides that talk about the proposed Akabipi-Lundin energy combination. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 418.46-424.58: London Energy's track record of creating value for shareholders for over 20 years, which you can see shown in this slide. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 425.05-432.39: So since the company's inception, the share price has grown 3 cents per share in 2001. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 432.41-435.74: To roughly 375 sec per share today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 436.84-442.92: While also along the way distributing around $2.5 billion through spin-outs and dividends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 443.26-450.11: And this represents a 28% compound annual average return every year for 20 years. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 451.69-456.50: However, the board has felt for a while that to prosper through the energy transition,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 456.62-462.52: That we need to build greater scale while retaining focus, being low cost and low carbon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 463.22-467.21: Which led to the process that we ran during the second half of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 467.35-475.24: We're resulting in this proposed transaction where we announced in December to combine Lundin Energy's E&P business with Aker BP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 476.36-481.56: And leaving Lundin Energy, renewables business, which is positioned to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 482.62-492.41: And I think this creates more value for shareholders. I think selling the renewable business with the E&P business would not create that extra value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 492.85-498.96: So, I'm convinced this transaction will continue our path of creating value for shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 502.00-509.65: So focusing now on the details of the transaction, the proposed combination of AccuPP and Lundin Energy's E&P business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 509.95-517.86: I think it's a tremendous deal to combine these two great companies, drawing on the best of both to make something even bigger and better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 518.28-525.29: It creates a Norwegian pure play E&P company of scale, production growth, low cost and low carbon emissions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 525.63-528.53: That I think is set to prosper through the energy transition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 529.25-534.21: It will be Europe's leading independent E&P company and one of the top. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 534.23-539.66: Independence in the world, with a market cap of today around $23 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 540.16-543.74: And will be Norway's third-ranked listed company by value. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 545.23-550.65: I think it's a great deal where the value of the combined business is greater than the component parts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 550.67-555.36: In this case, we can truly say one plus one is equal to more than two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 556.74-564.56: And for the Lundin Energy shareholders, this will deliver significant upfront cash consideration of approximately 72 sec per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 564.80-567.57: That's around 20% of the value of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 568.21-572.23: The opportunity to be a shareholder in the leading European E&P company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 572.65-580.12: And you can see receiving roughly 0.95 Akibibi shares for every one Lundin Energy share you hold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 581.12-585.87: And a retained interest in the new renewables business that is set for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 587.21-594.77: The combined business has the financial strength and cash flow profile to pay a growing and sustainable dividend into the next decade. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 595.74-599.70: Aker BP has announced a 14% increase in dividend for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 600.04-607.79: And the combined group will pay an annual dividend of $1.9 per share post completion on a quarterly basis. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 608.35-612.77: And the intent that is that will grow thereafter by at least 5% per annum. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 614.15-620.70: And so I'm convinced that this combination proposal with Akabipi is a win-win outcome for both sets of shareholders. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 621.40-625.25: And I think in terms of the process moving forward on the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 625.95-631.93: The Lundin Energy shareholders will be asked to vote on the transaction at our AGM at the end of March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 632.51-636.44: And the AkaBP shareholders will vote early April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 636.88-643.42: And then there's some necessary approvals, government approvals and competition authority approvals in Norway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 643.52-650.55: Which I think I see as a formality which will lead to closing of the transaction around the middle of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 654.03-660.40: And this is what the combined company looks like. It will have a reserve, some resources of over 2.7 billion BOEs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 661.38-666.01: Production today will be around 400,000 BOEs per day in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 666.09-672.15: And that will grow to over 525,000 BOEs per day in 2028. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 672.93-676.88: You can see industry-leading low operating costs of less than $7 a barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 677.32-683.04: And industry-leading low carbon emissions of around one quarter of industry average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 684.32-691.29: Providing the combined entity the opportunity to continue a progressive and market-leading decarbonisation strategy. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 691.31-695.80: Which I think you will hear more about from Aker BP in their Q4 results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 697.58-700.36: And also delivering sustainable and growing dividends. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 700.52-708.57: And this creates a company of scale, production growth, low cost, low carbon emissions, which as I say, I think will prosper through the energy transition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 712.67-718.30: And for the remaining Lundin Energy business, this will be a new renewable company that we intend to grow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 719.06-726.81: It has three high-quality renewable assets in the Nordics, which when fully built out will produce 600 gigawatt-hours per annum net. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 728.39-737.22: This business will be debt-free and with significant cash reserves to complete the projects and generating free cash flow from the end of 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 737.26-740.24: And with the financial capacity to grow the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 741.44-749.01: We also intend to position this to pursue other opportunities and consider other opportunities through the energy transition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 750.63-759.88: The business will remain listed on the NASDAQ Stockholm Exchange. And I think this is really a great opportunity to grow and create further significant value from this business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 760.54-768.09: And we will outline what the business plan, the management board and governance details are going to be for this on the 7th of March. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 768.11-771.53: So that you can understand the opportunity ahead of our AGM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 773.03-779.20: So that's what I wanted to cover. So now I'm going to hand over to Dan, who will give you some more details on our operations. So over to you, Dan. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 781.60-788.61: Thank you Nick and it's a pleasure to be here presenting today what has been a phenomenal year of performance for Lundin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 788.77-798.06: And notwithstanding the AkaBP transaction, a really exciting outlook for 2022 with a lot of activity aimed at continuing to grow the business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 799.40-807.45: And so if we look across the operations and the assets that we have today, it's been another year of really good top-tier operating performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 808.19-816.70: On Johan Sverdrup, the excellent performance we've seen over the past 18 months, two years has continued in the same fashion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 817.02-822.58: And we're going to touch a little bit later on where we see opportunities for resource or further resource growth in Johans Fendrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 824.00-832.71: On Edvard Grieg we've seen a reserves upgrade of around 40 million barrels this year, which is more than we produced from the area in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 833.05-840.34: And that comes from not only the Edvard Grieg field, but starting to see some of the upsides in the tiebacks. And so we'll delve into those a little bit more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 840.36-843.56: And the activities that we have to continue that growth into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 845.02-848.63: We have five new projects moving towards sanction this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 848.71-857.16: And that corresponds to net resources of around 240 million barrels that we're aiming to mature in towards the reserves at the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 857.60-865.81: And each of those projects has an exciting potential to continue to grow beyond what we put forward in these project sanctions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 867.13-869.35: If we look at the resource replacement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 869.75-878.40: We've added two barrels for every barrel we produced in 2021 and that comes primarily from the whistling acquisition we announced at the end of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 878.42-883.76: Growth in the Edvard Grieg area and the subsea tiebacks to Edvard Grieg as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 884.32-891.71: And that corresponds to 140 million barrels of 2P plus 2C resource additions in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 893.21-897.18: And the operating performance of the assets really has been world-class. We've been at. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 897.20-905.39: 98% on Edvard Grieg and Johan Sverdrup and 95% on Alfheim, which really is world-class performance from all of these assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 905.71-911.89: And something you'll see which is unparalleled in the industry when you look broadly across not only Norway but the wider industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 913.01-922.48: And we've done that at an all-in cost of $3.1 per barrel, net to us OPEX, and a carbon intensity of less than 3 kilograms of CO2 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 922.50-925.61: Which is really world-class operating performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 928.51-931.21: Nick touched quickly on our production in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 931.23-939.30: We finished the year above the top end of our original guidance range at just over 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 940.02-947.07: And you see here the growth towards the tail end of the year with 194 in Q3 and 195 in Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 947.23-951.15: And December finished just shy of 200,000 barrels per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 951.91-957.92: And the outperformance in 2021 really was due to Edvard Grieg and a little bit from Johan Svedrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 958.06-967.51: Really high production efficiency on both assets and we saw some increased capacity available on Invergreig which we took advantage of towards the tail end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 968.73-976.92: And that puts us in a position where now for six and a half years, the company has been delivering at or above the midpoint of its production guidance range. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 977.40-981.66: Which is really an outstanding achievement all considered. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 983.86-992.43: If we look forward towards 2022 and this year, we've given guidance of 180,000 to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 992.91-996.40: And that range is really driven by two main themes of activities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 997.08-1005.59: In Q2, we'll see turnarounds planned outages on Johans Fedrup, which will be the hookup and commissioning of the phase two platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1005.83-1008.99: Which will have been lifted late in Q1 of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1009.87-1012.97: Edward Greig has a planned maintenance turnaround as well in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1013.55-1021.74: And then in Q4, we see the start up of Johan's Federate Phase 2, and that really drives the opening and increasing of our guidance range towards the end of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1022.66-1030.91: And there's some flex in that range. In the low side, we see it start later in Q4. And in the high side, we see it starting in the early part of Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1031.53-1038.70: And so the external guidance for Johans Fedrup is firmly on track for Q4 and we see a range of outcomes possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1038.72-1041.56: In our external guidance for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1044.04-1046.87: And all of that will be completed with operating costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1047.05-1054.95: Still in our long-term guidance range of between $3 and $4 per barrel. And we maintain that range as we look forward with another year behind us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1056.28-1062.02: 2021, our outturn on the year was around just over 10 cents higher than what we expected at $3.10. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1062.38-1070.11: Still industry leading levels but we're impacted towards the tail end of the year by increased carbon prices and increased electricity prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1070.99-1075.48: As we move into 2022, we're guiding at $3.60 per BOE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1076.18-1085.23: And that takes into account the fact that we have increased costs in Johan Svedrup and we don't benefit from all of the production upside we see getting phase two online. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1086.31-1092.17: We also see an increase in carbon pricing and electricity pricing which is taken into account in this guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1093.35-1099.28: As we roll then into 2023 and we see a full year of production impact from Johan Sverdrup phase 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1099.86-1109.15: We will see our operating costs reduce back to our long-term average of between 3 and 4 and down at the lower end of that range where we remain on plateau for Johans Fedrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1109.89-1116.56: So all in all, we remain industry leading on operating costs and we expect to maintain that guidance going forwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1121.28-1128.51: Our carbon neutral promise still stands firm and we're now less than 12 months away from being carbon neutral on our operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1129.17-1134.49: And the three key pillars we have driving that carbon neutrality is firstly powering our assets from shore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1135.32-1141.82: Secondly, powering them by renewable assets which we've invested in, and third, natural carbon capture projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1142.68-1150.89: And on the electrification, we expect to see this online in Q4 of this year, when Edvard Grieg and Johan Sverdrup phase two are both powered from shore. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1151.21-1159.20: And once we see phase two online, then we'll see Edvard Grieg powered from shore through the P2 platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1160.30-1165.79: Our renewable projects are progressing well and by the end of next year all three of the projects will be fully online. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1166.69-1171.43: Today, Laikanger is fully online, which is a hydropower plant in Norway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1172.25-1175.32: MLK we have around half the turbines generating power. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1176.00-1178.54: About three quarters of them are fully commissioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1178.56-1187.03: And nearly all of them bar one are fully constructed. And so we are slightly delayed from our original plan of end of last year, but we expect to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1187.05-1191.17: MLK fully online and handed over towards the tail end of Q1 this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1191.83-1194.69: Then we move into Sweden with our cast groove project. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1195.06-1203.04: And that'll be online towards the tail end of 2023. And the activities, project activities have already commenced on Karsk Ruf. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1204.30-1213.17: And then our natural carbon capture projects, once we complete those first two pillars, there's a small amount of remaining emissions and our natural carbon capture projects are firmly on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1213.81-1216.00: We've planted around half a million trees to date. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1216.04-1225.07: We have just shy of 3 million being planted this year and a total of 8 million trees being planted which will capture the residual emissions from our business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1225.97-1233.51: And as we move forward, Nick touched on this a little bit, ACABP will acquire the assets and will pick up all of the electrification projects and assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1233.91-1240.64: They will also pick up the natural carbon capture projects with the renewables staying behind in Linden Energy's renewables company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1241.40-1247.55: And Aker BP are going to communicate a little more on this when they come out and speak to the markets later in their Q4 results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1250.91-1258.42: Then if we start to look through some of the key assets across our portfolio, Johan Svendrup really has had another year of world-class delivery. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1259.38-1266.63: We've seen emissions from the Johans Fedrup asset at significantly lower than 0.1 kilograms of CO2 per barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1267.69-1276.90: Operating costs down at less than $2 a barrel with extremely high production efficiency and a credit to all of the teams involved in making this performance happen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1277.96-1287.99: This will continue with phase two coming on stream and we see some of the benefits of that not only on Johans Fjord but in the whole Utsira high region with the power from shore infrastructure coming on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1288.41-1291.59: And so we expect to see this performance continuing on Johans Fedrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1294.27-1300.10: If we look at the opportunities for resource growth, and we opened this door a little bit at the end of last year where. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1300.70-1308.99: We're now looking, now that we have more production data from phase one, we're looking at opportunities on how we can continue to grow the Johans Federik field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1309.11-1315.70: And how we can realize some of the key themes that we see as upside in Johan Sverdrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1316.64-1325.35: The first one that we touched on in our reserves announcement and today in our guidance announcement is on acceleration. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1325.91-1330.27: And so this year we've put a range of infill wells into our 2P reserves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1330.71-1339.36: And we see a lot more potential in the field for infill drilling and bringing forward some of the tail-end resources from Johans Fedrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1339.80-1346.23: And this field has an extremely long tail and a lot of volumes which can be recovered over its entire field life. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1346.63-1351.33: If we're able to take some of those volumes and move them forward, extending plateau,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1351.35-1360.54: And arresting the decline are two opportunities where we can see significant potential and we're doing pieces of work to try and identify and understand what that potential looks like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1362.20-1371.13: Secondly, there's some constraints around some of the facilities capacity and reservoir management that we're trying to understand and investigate here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1371.83-1376.38: And especially around water handling and water injection, we see some significant upside there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1377.44-1382.44: And finally, you can see here the development so far has been concentrated in the field center. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1383.10-1388.39: And we still see significant opportunity and uncertainty around the outside and the flanks of the field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1388.41-1390.79: Where there's opportunity for further understanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1390.81-1400.54: Potentially increased thickness of the reservoir and further to that further development which could see some of those volumes being produced. So with all three of these. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1400.56-1410.53: Acceleration through infill drilling, an improvement in capacity and further understanding and development of the flanks of the field, we see significant running room in Johans Fedrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1411.07-1415.06: And that in the fullness of time we'll be able to share more details of what that looks like. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1417.14-1421.62: The Phase 2 project on Johans Fjordrup is firmly on schedule for Q4 of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1422.68-1427.43: We're around 70% complete now. We've started drilling on some of the satellite areas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1427.81-1434.89: And the P2 processing platform will be installed in late Q1 of this year with the hookup and commissioning in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1435.58-1443.36: And the project teams are doing a phenomenal job at managing all of the risks and uncertainties with this project, notwithstanding COVID over the last. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1443.38-1447.23: Two years and being able to keep this project firmly on track. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1447.85-1456.60: And not only on track on schedule, we're on cost as well. So we still sit with costs in line with the PDO estimate for phase two. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1459.00-1461.24: Moving now onto the Greater Edvard Grieg Area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1461.88-1471.29: And this really is a core area for Lundin Energy and one where we've seen significant growth and significant upside. And there's still a significant amount of activity in this region. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1472.21-1482.10: We started with Edvard Grieg at 186 million barrels of 2P reserves when we sanctioned the project. And now in the greater area, we see that growing to 450. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.94-1494.77: If we include the upsides and some potential exploration success, we could be between 600 and 800 million barrels of reserves and resources in this area, which is over four times what we started with. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1495.66-1499.64: Evergreig itself is performing well. We've seen outperformance reserves increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1500.06-1506.13: Solvayk has grown over the years. This year as well, we see reserves increase because of the results of drilling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1506.61-1514.49: And we've got three projects in the area, a further development on Solvay, Rolfsnes full field and Lille Prinsen to the north where we see future potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1514.51-1516.72: To grow in the Edvard Grieg area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1519.58-1520.82: Edvard Grieg itself. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1521.02-1530.55: We announced just shy of 30 million barrels increase in the 2P reserves from Edvard Grieg and you can see in the bottom left here how much this has grown since PDO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1531.19-1536.68: 186 million barrels is now just shy of 380 and we still have upsides to continue to grow that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1537.78-1545.03: And where we see upsides, we completed the InfoWells this year on schedule, on budget. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1545.65-1553.21: And the productivity from two of these whales with the fish bones is significantly higher than what we expected to see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1553.85-1559.68: And so we see further potential to deploy the fish bones more towards the eastern flanks of the field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1560.00-1564.16: And the eastern core of the field where we have slightly poorer reservoir quality. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1564.50-1568.87: And that's where we see the real benefit of these fishbone completions by increasing productivity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1569.99-1574.45: We drilled for the first time production wells into the Jorvik High in the Jorvik Basin. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1574.83-1580.64: And we see further running room which we'll understand a little bit more through the production performance of the wells. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1581.48-1589.67: In the northern area, we have two wells already producing from the Tellus area, where we see a very small layer of Asgard sand sitting above basements. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1590.15-1598.34: And those two wells in the north have seen a really good charge from the basement into this thin sand, giving us good production performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1598.84-1605.59: And so we'll talk in a slide or two around the whole basement potential in the region, but already we have wells on production in the basement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1606.25-1612.83: In Jorvik and in Telus we have further opportunity in the field to explore what the basement potential could be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1612.85-1616.86: On top of where this Asgard sand will sit in those regions. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1617.90-1622.18: On top of that, we have further infill drilling planned in the core of the field as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1622.38-1628.77: Although we've already seen significant resource growth in Edvard Grieg, I don't think we're yet finished with Edvard Grieg. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1630.73-1634.63: In Solvayk, we started this field in Q3 of 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1635.24-1646.79: And we've seen an increase in reservoir properties due to the results of the drilling campaign on Solvaygen. So, that drives the increase of 11 million barrels to our 2P reserves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1647.49-1656.66: We're now getting ready for a phase two development, which will take into account the D-segment discovery we made last year, and there's a well towards the northeast of the field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1657.06-1660.10: And in the southwest you see two wells in the synrift section. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1660.62-1663.72: And so we'll be maturing this project through towards PDO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1664.28-1672.17: And we're looking at opportunities. We see segment A there. We're looking at opportunities to further explore and expand Solvay to continue this growth story. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1675.84-1682.04: And finally on the Edvard Grieg area, a little bit around Lil Princeton and the regional basement potential and Rolfsnes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1682.70-1685.35: In Rolesnes if we start in the south of this. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.73-1694.93: Rollsness has a resource potential of between 14 and 78 million barrels of resources. We have the extended well test which we started up last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1695.70-1702.04: And this well test aims to prove a number of things in the basement. One, that we have productivity over a long period of time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1702.68-1708.61: And two, that we have a water cut development that allows for a full field development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1708.65-1718.26: The stability of the water cut development is key to ensure that the fractured and weathered basement continues to contribute to a well over a long period of time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1718.36-1724.46: And we see matrix flow, not only fracture flow where we see water coming up from underneath the field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1724.90-1730.33: And what we've seen in Rollsness is our water cut is stabilizing around 45% to 50%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1730.93-1739.36: And the key thing is that the stability in the water cut development means we're seeing a lot more contribution from the weathered basement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1739.98-1742.14: And a lot more contribution from the Matrix. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1742.60-1751.89: And so because we're starting to see this water cut stabilize, it suggests that we've got a significant running room on Rollsness to continue with a full field development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1752.31-1760.04: And I think what you'll see on that development is a phased development where we take small steps to further understand the resource potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1760.90-1765.47: And so if we take that knowledge on the basement and step up to Lil Prince and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1766.31-1773.03: Last year we completed a transaction with Equinor to acquire an extra 20% and take operatorship of Lil Prinsen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1773.37-1777.20: And then we drilled a suite of exploration and appraisal wells this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1777.92-1783.70: And what we've found is some good quality sands in Lillprinson, but we've also found basement potential below. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1784.38-1790.39: And so what you see here in the resource range is primarily the good quality sands with a small amount of basement potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1790.91-1797.38: But what we found in that basement is we have three times the thickness or up to three times the thickness of what we do in Rollsness. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1798.54-1807.99: And we also have the oil in Lillprinson is the same as Edvard Grieg and roughly in pressure communication, potentially through the aquifer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1808.39-1812.71: You have this basement potential that extends from Rolfsnes all the way up to Lilleprinsen. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1813.43-1820.36: And we have the ability to go and phase the development in Lillprinson as well to test some of this basement potential on top of the base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1820.90-1830.75: And so if we put our arms around all of that, there's potentially up to 300 million barrels of gross potential in this area due to basement alone on top of what we have in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1830.77-1833.97: In the field and the non-basement potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1834.77-1843.96: And so we'll be spending a little bit more time this year with both the PDOs and the understanding in the area to try and explore what further potential we have in the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1843.98-1846.53: The regional basement in the Atira High. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1849.17-1859.12: Stepping out of the Atsira High into Westing, this will become a new core production area for Lundin Energy. And as Nick touched on earlier, it's a really strategic acquisition for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1859.48-1864.38: That adds long life resources into a window where we're looking for that growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1865.13-1870.97: And so we remain firmly on track with engineering and the work required to submit the PDO at the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1871.91-1876.14: And we've also been awarded a further license in the latest app around. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1876.56-1882.98: And will take a 35% working interest in all of the acreage around wisting and operatorship of the exploration phase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1883.46-1888.89: And there's running room of up to 500 million barrels as identified today on that exploration potential. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1889.55-1898.92: And we'll be working with Equinor, the operator, to mature that forward. So, really exciting area. I think there's more to hear regarding whisting as we move forwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1901.28-1907.41: In the Alfheim area, the fantastic work that AQA BP have been doing in Alfheim really continues. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1908.11-1913.51: We see new projects, Cobra East and Cobra East Gecko and Frost were sanctioned last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1914.07-1919.00: And they're moving into the execution phase and we should see Trell and Trene moving through the same process this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1919.80-1928.95: And those material additions add significant volumes but also significant production into the profile for the Alfheim area. And I think that will continue into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1931.83-1939.92: Looking at the future growth potential, we have three projects in execution just now, KEGG-Frosk and Johans Fedrup Phase 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1940.40-1947.19: And then five more progressing to PDO and those five represent 240 million barrels net resource. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1947.71-1952.25: And so that project is our short to medium term production growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1952.77-1958.94: And then we have a remaining program of five E&A wells in 2022, targeting around 140 million barrels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1959.58-1962.00: And so we'll see those being drilled through the course of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1962.40-1970.73: And then we have a material program ongoing with still around 100 licenses in Norway and an exciting program for 2023 and beyond as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1974.85-1981.50: My final two slides looking at reserves, resources and production on the reserves and resources position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1981.96-1985.25: We touched on the 200% resource replacement ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1985.69-1987.11: For 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1987.55-1991.59: And that's made up of primarily Wisting, Edvard Grieg and Solvay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1991.93-1999.12: And so if we look at the reconciliation of our 2P reserves and 2C resources, we see the production of 71 million barrels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1999.52-2007.79: We see the Edvard Grieg and Solvay 2P reserve additions of 39, corresponding to around 55% reserve replacement ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2008.33-2016.56: And then we see the whisting transaction coming in, less some of the stranded assets in the barrens which we took off the books at the end of last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2016.96-2021.36: And all of that together points towards a strong resource replacement ratio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2021.38-2030.43: Two barrels added for every barrel produced and over a billion BOEs of 2P resources – sorry, 2C resources and 2P reserves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2033.17-2040.60: And then my final slide before I hand over to Titor is our long-term production outlook. And we've shared this for the last few years at CMD. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.22-2046.31: And year on year, we see that the 2P reserves position continues to increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2046.93-2051.13: And so you can see on here in the dark blue bars our current 2p reserves position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2051.55-2057.18: And you see in the red line what the 2P reserves were at the year-end 2020, so 12 months ago. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2057.68-2059.74: And you see nearly every year an increase. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2060.24-2067.05: And our role as a technical and management team is to turn some of the 3p and upsides into 2p reserves over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2067.39-2074.81: And I think you've seen our track record of doing that year after year and you see the potential in our asset base to continue to do that over time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2075.24-2083.40: And so we all believe that that 3P and upsides will continue to be added into the 2P and new opportunities will come on top of that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2084.32-2089.87: And so our production growth outlook is greater than 200 by 2023 and significantly more as you can see here. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2090.31-2095.74: And where we will sustain that greater than 200 with this pipeline of projects and new opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2096.82-2102.14: And so it's been a fantastic year in 2021, really strong performance across all of the assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2102.58-2106.35: And I think there's a really exciting portfolio for this year to continue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2106.37-2119.62: And putting this portfolio together with AkabP, as Nick touched on, creates one of the world's – or certainly Europe's – leading and one of the world's leading low-cost, low-carbon companies with significant growth into the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2120.80-2130.61: And with that, I'll pass over to Taita. OK, thanks, Dan, for that. And good afternoon, everybody, or good morning, depending on where you are. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2131.39-2141.18: So we're now going to go through Q4 financial numbers, which again are going to show a very strong quarterly performance. And we're also touching on the full year results for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2141.90-2148.61: And then towards the end we will give a brief guidance on the 2022 numbers as we see them. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2149.45-2158.30: And just a comment on the accounting implications from the announced deal with Docker BP whereby we combine our EMP business with Docker BP. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2159.12-2165.13: What that means is that from the fourth quarter onward we will present all the numbers relating to the E&P business as... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2165.15-2169.17: As discontinued operations in our consolidated income statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2169.99-2179.74: Similarly, on our consolidated balance sheet, we will present the liabilities and assets associated with that business as assets and liabilities held for distribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2180.58-2189.59: But in terms of the numbers we are presenting here today, you will see everything as normal as we are combining this continued and continued operation together in one financial metric. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2192.53-2200.30: So starting off with the key highlights for the fourth quarter and also Q4, for the full year and Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2201.28-2207.17: As we announced ahead of releases that we have had an overlift in the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2207.85-2216.14: So the sales volume is 199,000 BOE per day. And that is then the number that drives all the financial numbers we're reporting for the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2216.72-2221.78: And similarly for the full year we were also over lifted on an annualized basis by roundabout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2221.80-2226.99: 6,000 barrels or 196,000 BOE per day in terms of salt volume. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2228.75-2238.14: Strong price, oil prices have been very strong, similar to gas prices, $77 a barrel for the crude oil we sold. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2238.16-2239.92: In the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2240.46-2247.49: And actually over $200 a barrel in BOE terms for gas, around about $34 per MCF. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.55-2258.42: Obviously the gas market in Europe has been well advertised to be extremely tight and that's certainly shown through in our realised gas prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2259.48-2265.35: Cost, we've been through those to some degree, but $3.81 per barrel for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2266.07-2270.39: And we had oil and gas investments of just over $230 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2270.95-2279.72: And also we completed the visiting acquisition in the fourth quarter, so that led to a 320 million dollar cash consideration to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2279.74-2282.28: OMV for the 25% we acquired. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2283.84-2292.21: In terms of cash generation for the full year, you can see on the top right here EBITDA generation of over 4.8 billion dollars for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2292.23-2295.82: And cash flows from our operating activities over $3 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2296.48-2301.30: And then generating free cash flow of 1.6 billion dollars for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2302.10-2308.67: And that delivered the debt position of the company down to just over 2.7 billion dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2309.97-2319.02: And as Nick mentioned, we are again increasing dividends. That was the criteria we set out when we started off paying dividends in 2018. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2319.70-2324.94: And we've essentially increased dividends in line with financial earnings over that period, except for the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2324.97-2331.15: Year 2020 when we had the COVID impact but again a material increase in dividend proposed to the AJM this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2331.17-2338.82: Of 25% which equates to just over 56 cents per quarter in quarterly dividend payments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2341.58-2347.25: If we then look at some of the key financial metrics that we normally report on as we go through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2347.81-2351.81: Starting off with EBITDA at 1.2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2351.83-2358.00: $4.6 billion for the quarter. That's generated a revenue of 1.55 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2358.02-2365.91: And as you can see in the top right corner, very strong sales price for the quarter, $84 per BOE. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2366.03-2375.68: Obviously, as I mentioned, the gas real, gas prices is pulling off the BOE number quite significantly. So 94% up on the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2375.72-2382.18: And also the sales volumes up 18.3 million barrels, up 6% on the same quarter last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2383.36-2388.89: The cash flows from operation in the fourth quarter came in just below $560 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2389.61-2396.06: In the fourth quarter, we always have a higher tax installment in Norway, given how the phasing of tax installments works. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2396.68-2399.44: So we paid $710 million in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.92-2402.22: In cash taxes in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2402.80-2411.89: And in addition, we also had a working capital build of over $140 million, given the continued strong oil price performance as we went through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2412.63-2418.14: So also CFFO is up more than doubled on the same period last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2419.72-2424.18: Free cash flow before dividend payments, $22 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2425.15-2431.71: And that was also impacted by the settlement of the visiting acquisition of $320 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2432.25-2438.98: So we had all-in investment levels of $530 million in the quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.72-2449.05: And then in terms of adjusted net results, $293 million for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2449.73-2455.70: But on the face of the income statement, if you combine discontinued and continued operation, we came in at $122 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2456.42-2461.24: Again, the announced acquisition with Acre BP has led to certain one-off. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2461.26-2469.47: Financial items which we normally just moved through equity is now having to be charged through the income statement such as. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2469.49-2475.84: FX and interest rate swaps which are now all deemed ineffective given the transaction we have announced. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2476.52-2484.64: So that movement normally went through equity, whereas now going forward that will be fully charged through the income statement. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2487.67-2494.61: And then a similar outlook for the full year. We generated 5.1 billion dollars of revenue for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2495.18-2502.46: So that led, as I said, to EBITDA of $4.8 billion. And at our Q3 numbers, we actually guided EBITDA, full-year EBITDA between. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2502.48-2507.63: 4.8 to 4.9, so we came roughly in at the middle of that guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2508.91-2513.39: And then CFFO came in at, as I said, just above $3 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2513.83-2517.96: That then includes cash tax payment for the full year of 1.4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2517.98-2532.35: Billion dollars and also a working capital built for the full year of 230 million dollars. So very strong cash flow generation and more than doubling from 2020 numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2533.65-2541.04: And as Nick said, free cash flow from operation, free cash flow before dividend payments, $1.6 billion for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2541.76-2548.35: That's actually covering dividends three and a half times the cash dividend we've paid out over the last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2549.37-2554.43: And then adjusted net results just below $800 million when we... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2554.45-2560.08: Take out the non-cash FX impacts we have on numbers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.76-2567.35: And on the face of the income statement, we have reported just below $500 million in net profit for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2570.25-2575.90: Just touching a bit more in detail on our realized crude prices as we've gone through the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2576.38-2579.54: You can see on the chart to the right here that we are showing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2579.56-2586.35: The timing difference, which is the orange bar on the average dated Brent for each quarter. And you can see in the first half of the year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2586.37-2595.30: The timing of our lifting led to us actually outperforming unrealized prices, half a dollar in the first quarter and one dollar in the second. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2596.02-2602.48: But you can see that trend then reversing in Q3, Q4, particularly in Q4, you can see on the chart to the left. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2603.08-2609.01: We had a high lifted volume in December just as the dated Brent was dropping. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2609.65-2616.16: And that's therefore led to a timing difference of $1.70 for the fourth quarter negative impact on our real-est prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2616.98-2622.52: And the red bars you see here are then the differentials to the dated brand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2623.16-2625.45: And we've sold between half a dollar to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2625.75-2629.37: To $2 differentials in each of these quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2629.39-2636.56: It's been a very busy year for our crude oil marketing department. We've sold close to 100 cargos for the year, so almost two cargos per week. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2637.54-2643.78: So the team here in Geneva has done a great job in firstly marketing and then selling all these cargoes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2646.81-2654.93: And on gas, gas prices has been very much an increasing trend as we've gone through the year and actually in December alone. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2655.08-2662.66: We realised the $240 per barrel per BOE equivalent in realised gas prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2663.30-2666.79: So very strong macro environment here on gas sales. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2666.81-2674.09: In Europe we are selling both into the UK market and into the Dutch gas market on pricing ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2674.73-2679.44: And of course, importantly, when Edward Grieg will be fully electrified at the end of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2679.46-2686.81: Our gas sales volume will obviously increase since we are not going to burn any gas on the gas turbines on the Netrogrig. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2687.33-2694.25: So that will lead to even further revenues from our gas production when we look into 2023 and beyond. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2696.96-2703.74: Then looking at operating costs and EBITDA margin, we continue to very much have industry-leading. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2703.76-2710.13: Unit operating costs out there and which is leading to an exceptionally high EBITDA margin you can see here 94%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2710.73-2715.70: In Q4 and in fact it's been around about 94% over the last five quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2716.68-2723.16: On the chart to the left you can see there was a little bit of an uptick in unit op-ex for the fourth quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2723.84-2732.83: Dan touched upon this already, but you can see at the bottom of the bars here, you can see the actual impact from higher electricity prices and also higher CO2 prices. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2733.39-2737.48: Both of those prices increased roughly 50% from Q3 to Q4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2738.38-2747.97: So that was leading to a somewhat higher unit of pegs, also combined with a somewhat stronger Norwegian kroner compared to previous quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2748.65-2752.51: So all in that has pushed the unit opex to $3.81. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2753.07-2762.64: But nevertheless still extremely low and for the full year as Dan said we came in at $3.10 for the year as an average. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2765.95-2776.28: Then looking at tax, the top two charts show the Q4 effective tax rate on the face of the income statement of 89%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2776.96-2781.42: But if we then again adjust for the non-cash financial items. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2782.64-2785.85: Which have very little tax impact for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2786.41-2790.59: Then you can see we get to a 79% effective tax rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2791.27-2799.96: Which is very much in line with what you would expect given that we operate in Norway where you have a 78% effective tax rate. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2800.94-2806.99: And then the chart on the bottom here shows you the phasing of our cash tax installments as I mentioned. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2807.01-2812.79: In Q4 we had a significantly higher tax installment given that you make two tax installments in that quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2813.47-2822.52: So $711 million installed in Q4. And if you sum up all of the quarter last year, we paid $1.4 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2823.02-2830.65: But you will also see on our balance sheet that we have a tax liability, a current tax liability of close to $1.6 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2831.17-2839.54: And that's then the cash tax, cash out payment we have to make in first half this year to fully settle the 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2839.56-2841.70: Tax dues. So you can see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2841.72-2846.49: We have already locked in these tax installments of... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2846.51-2853.03: 510 million dollars in Q1 and just over a billion dollars in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2853.05-2858.62: Based on the year-end FX rate of 8.8 NOK to the dollar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2860.04-2866.95: So those are the locked-in PAX installments we already know we have to make in Q1 and Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2870.15-2874.35: Then looking at the full year cash generation for the business, which as I said was very strong. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2875.10-2880.56: The CFFO, organic CFFO, before we adjust for the working capital, came in at close to $3.3 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2880.58-2885.69: And after working capital $3.58 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2886.47-2891.31: We have total investments during the year of just over $1.4 billion. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2891.93-2898.46: Around about $300 million relates to ENA and $320 million relates to the visiting acquisition. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2899.50-2905.69: And then the Delta is split roughly a third, a third, a third for Edward Grieg, Johannes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2905.71-2909.69: With some smaller items also on the Albheim area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2910.45-2916.12: So that's how we define the free cash flow before dividends of $1.6 billion for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2916.92-2922.62: And you can see here the total dividend payment of $455 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2922.64-2926.01: And debt reduction of close to $800 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2926.03-2934.51: Which therefore gave us a cash build of $370 million. So we're exiting 2021 with a cash tax. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2934.79-2939.52: Sorry, a cash balance of $450 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2942.02-2946.61: In terms of debt position and liquidity hedging for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2946.79-2955.01: At year end we had gross debt of 3.2 billion dollars which consists of bonds amounting to 2 billion dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2955.03-2962.56: And terminal loans spread over three, four and five-year maturities of $1.2 billion. So, in total, 3.2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2963.36-2971.61: And as I said, around it we have cash of just below half a billion dollars, leaving the net debt of 2.7 billion dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2972.29-2975.34: In terms of available liquidity for the group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2976.40-2986.07: We have an on-drawn revolving credit facility of $1.5 billion. So in addition to the cash we are holding, we have in total around about $2 billion of cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2986.17-2990.63: Of liquidity headroom as of year end 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2994.21-2999.20: If we now turn into guidance for 2022,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2999.30-3007.63: And what I should emphasize here is that this guidance is provided on a Lundin standalone basis as if the Acre. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3007.65-3010.37: BP combination is not happening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3011.53-3020.18: But as I said in my introduction, from now up to closing, we will continue to report the E&P business as discontinued operations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3021.08-3030.55: So the numbers here are essentially reflecting no deal happening at all and the year would be as a normal EMP year for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3032.11-3038.08: So the guidance here, the key highlights are, as I said earlier, the dividend of $2.25 per share. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3038.64-3041.74: And that will be proposed to the AJM in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3042.34-3048.77: And we will then commence our quarterly dividends as normal until the deal with Accra BP completes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3049.71-3055.46: The CFFO guidance we are giving here is between 1.3 to 2.1 billion dollars for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3056.34-3063.38: And that's on an oil price range between 65 to 85 dated Brent average for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3064.82-3074.57: And on the midpoint of the price bracket we give, which is $75 per Brent, we anticipate to generate free cash flow after dividend payments for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3075.08-3083.00: So that will reduce net debt to EBITDA down still further to roughly 0.5 times ratio at year-end 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3084.20-3089.17: We've been through the OPEC's guidance and as we announced this morning, the oil and gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3089.19-3094.15: Investment is estimated to amount to $760 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3094.37-3100.66: And then renewable and natural carbon capture projects amounting to around about 70 million dollars. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3103.20-3108.01: And then running through the details of our guidance as we normally do. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3108.43-3115.94: So if you focus on the mid column here, which is our base case planning assumption on oil price in 2022, $75. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3115.96-3118.46: And 100 pence a term in gas price. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3119.32-3128.61: That will then generate a revenue per barrel of $76.70, which is $5.3 billion in absolute revenue. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3129.13-3134.45: Giving a cash margin of $5.1 billion, or around about $73 a barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3135.50-3138.92: And an EBITDA net back of 72.40 per. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3138.94-3147.77: Per barrel or just above $5 billion in EBITDA generation based on our midpoint scenario of $75 Brent. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3151.09-3158.28: And then in terms of P&L impact, as I said, the cash margin is $73 a barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3158.92-3167.13: We have a depletion charge of just below $11 a barrel, which is slightly above the depletion rate we run with in 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3168.09-3174.85: And the DNA is running, as usual, at a very low rate, 60 cents per barrel produced for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3175.72-3183.64: And then financial items which includes income from joint ventures which are our renewable projects in Finland and Laikangar in Norway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3183.84-3191.37: Amounting to $2 a barrel, so giving us profit before tax just below $60 a barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3192.21-3199.28: And then the tax charge, around about $47 a barrel, giving us a net after-tax profit of 12. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3199.30-3207.95: $12 a barrel. And you can see here the current tax as a percentage of the EBITDA generation in the midpoint oil price scenario. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3207.97-3209.67: 61%. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3210.35-3218.48: And that will equate to roughly just over $3 billion in current tax for the year 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3219.08-3224.20: And that tax calculation is based on the proposed new tax legislation in Norway. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3224.30-3230.61: Which is going through parliament soon but hasn't been ratified as yet but the numbers are based on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3230.63-3232.25: That it will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3237.44-3247.13: And then the last slide on the NetBuck guidance for us here. This is the cash flows from operation for 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3247.95-3257.08: And we are sitting, as I said, between $1.3 billion at the $65 case up to $2.1 billion in the $85 case. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3257.98-3267.21: And in this year, we will have the cash tax payments will actually mirror to a large degree the current tax that we will charge through the income statement, given that we have a... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3267.23-3268.89: 1.6 billion dollar. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3268.91-3273.45: Cash up, cash tax payment to make this year relating to the 2021. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3273.47-3274.59: Tax bill. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3275.88-3283.58: And you can see here all the capital items are amounting up to $12 a barrel or around about $830 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3284.42-3294.01: So that will therefore give us a free cash flow available for dividends of between 6.8 to 18.3 dollars a barrel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3294.63-3300.94: So certainly in the 75 and 85 dollar cases you can see that we are more than funding the dividend payments we are proposing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3301.78-3310.91: And in the $65 case, we are slightly drawing on that to fund the dividend to the tune of $140 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3311.61-3317.80: But the bottom line here is that it's a low-OPEX business and it's also a very low CAPEX intensity business. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3317.82-3324.22: All in capex to grow production further is only $12 a barrel for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3327.31-3332.71: And if we then look out in time and focus on the CAPEX profile we have,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3332.73-3340.46: If we focus on the 2P plus firm, which is essentially our 2P resource plus listing and some of the projects in the Alvheim area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3341.32-3345.51: You can see this year, as we guided this morning, $520 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3346.25-3348.15: This year and a similar level next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3348.37-3357.20: And then when visiting expenditure starts to ramp up, you can see that we are running at around about 700 million dollars per year for out to 2026. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3357.78-3363.86: So it'll continue to be a business with relatively low capex intensity as we look out in time. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3364.76-3373.99: And then the lighter blue bars here are the growth projects that Dan talked about, mainly relating to rose-ness and sol-like expenditures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3374.25-3379.54: In 2024, the majority of this spend would relate to roles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3380.00-3389.71: And then in 2025 you have a roughly 50-50 split between Rolls-Royce and Solvay phase 2 in terms of development expenditure. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3393.13-3399.30: And my final slide before I hand back to Nick is just a quick summary of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3399.32-3405.53: Guidance we have set out in our press release this morning, so 180 to 200,000 BOE per day for the full year guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3406.11-3413.13: And all our numbers in terms of net back guidance was based on the midpoint of this 190,000 BOE per day for the full year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3413.97-3420.80: We've been through the OPEX which is slightly up $3.60 for this year but dropping down to $3.10 again in 2023. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3420.94-3424.06: When we have a full year worth of Phase 2 Johan Sverdrup. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3424.08-3425.43: Contribution. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3425.65-3432.25: And the capital items that we went through earlier amounting to $830 million. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3432.59-3438.54: Including renewables and carbon capture expenditure and some decommissioning costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3439.74-3444.06: So with that, I will hand back to Nick with some concluding remarks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3446.25-3447.81: Well, thanks, Dan and Tita. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3447.97-3455.38: I've just got one final slide before we open up for questions. I just want to leave you with these three key messages. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3455.72-3459.18: We delivered record operational and record financial results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3459.86-3464.36: In the year, supporting increased dividend proposal to the AGM. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3465.41-3474.73: Secondly, the proposed combination of Lundin Energy's E&P business and Akka BP creates a leading European independent E&P company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3475.03-3483.82: Which I'm convinced is a win-win outcome for both sets of shareholders. And it's expected that that transaction will complete around the middle of this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3484.88-3490.43: And then thirdly, the remaining Lundin Energy is a new renewable energy business positioned for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3491.23-3498.88: And we'll let you – we'll provide you more details about that and the strategy for that business in early March so you can understand the opportunity. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3499.96-3504.80: So those are our full year 2021 results and outlook for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3505.79-3512.91: Thanks for your time. And we'd now like to open up the call for your questions. And I think Ed is going to run that process for us. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3514.83-3524.02: Thanks very much, Nick. Mark, we'll open up for questions from your conference call line first, and then you can hand back to me and I'll see if there's any from the web. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3524.18-3527.15: So over to you, Mark. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3527.91-3537.80: The callers on the phones. If you do wish to ask a question please dial 01 on your telephone keypad now to enter the queue. Once your name has been announced you can ask your question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3538.38-3543.78: If you find your question is answered before it's your turn to speak, you can dial 02 to cancel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3544.28-3549.61: So once again that's 01 for ask a question or 02 if you need to cancel. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3550.51-3558.38: Our first question comes from the line of Sacha Kamp Chiduru of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3560.00-3568.47: Thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. The first was related to the 2022 to 2026 CAPEX guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3569.45-3573.39: If I were to compare today's guidance with the one presented in last year's Capital Markets Day,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3573.93-3583.60: It appears there is a significant increase in the underlying capex levels. And here I'm comparing the capex required for the 2P reserves with last year's total capex projections. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3584.42-3591.45: If you could let us know the key reasons for the increase you mentioned, CAPEX for Rolseness and Solvay. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3591.97-3595.68: Is that the only reason for the increase or are there other reasons as well? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3596.40-3604.80: Also, if you could reconfirm again, the CAPEX guidance for the discovered and the contingent resource subside, that is primarily for the visiting development, I suppose. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3606.27-3612.93: The second question was regarding the comment made on the reduction of the 2C contingent resource base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3613.21-3620.00: That was related to the standard assets in the balance sheet. I was just wondering if they could provide more. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3620.60-3623.14: On what these resources were if there were any key discoveries. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3623.86-3630.65: Highlighted that would be helpful. Thanks. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3631.63-3639.04: Yeah, I can on the CapEx guidance. So what we call 2P plus firm includes obviously all our 2P reserves and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3639.06-3642.94: The bulk of that remaining expenditure really relates to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3642.96-3644.78: The build out of Jansfergo Phase 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3645.63-3655.40: What we call firm here is the majority of that is the visiting development, which is a material capex project obviously up in the Barents Sea. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3655.96-3663.10: When we guided last year, we only had 10% of listing in our numbers, whereas with the acquisition with OMV this year,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3663.14-3668.81: That number is now 35% equity in the visiting development. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3669.37-3679.08: And from 2024 onward, the bulk of the 2PiPos firm really relates to the building out of the Visting development. So that is the answer to that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3680.72-3689.71: I think on the Barents Sea assets, the small discoveries are Nydens, Salina, Filakudi, small 10 to 20 million barrel gas or. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3689.73-3691.57: Small oil-stranded assets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3691.59-3694.15: Nothing of any materiality in the Barons. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3697.26-3701.84: Great, thank you very much. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3702.12-3708.27: Our next question comes from the line of Johan Chantant of Société Générale. Please go ahead. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3709.73-3717.00: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you to Taito to provide that much granularity on the financial section of the presentation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3717.40-3721.12: I would like to come back onto this slide showing the CAPEX profile. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3721.98-3725.53: Interesting to know if that is possible to understand. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3725.55-3734.01: How much of the whisting project is shown here? Because of course, as you said, whisting will only start to impact CAPEX. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3734.03-3736.92: From 2024 onwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3737.02-3743.66: First of all, as we speak, also the project has yet to be sanctioned, slated for 2028. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3744.10-3752.97: So on this slide, basically, what is the share of the full CAPEX associated with whisting that is shown. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3754.45-3756.62: And then the second question will be. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3756.64-3768.87: Trying to come back onto some content you used to provide to the investment community that was your free cash flow break-even sort of level over the midterm. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3768.97-3779.06: Are you able to provide any color on this on your ENP portfolio? Indeed, over the midterm, we're at sort of free cash for break-even. We should sort of have in mind. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3779.46-3786.33: And then the final question is in relation to the portfolio or the inventory of resources. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3786.41-3791.89: That could be CNF ID by the end of this year to benefit from tax relief. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3792.37-3800.00: Are you able to provide a bit more color on the share looking away from wasting as part of this inventory? Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3803.66-3804.76: Yeah. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3807.35-3812.21: We guide out to 2026 here and I should say... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3812.45-3819.30: The visiting project is scheduled to start up in 2028. So obviously there will be continued cap export in 27 and. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3819.48-3822.90: And 28 and probably some drilling beyond that even. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3823.92-3829.35: But we align the cabinet's guidance here with our production guidance, which we're also showing out to 2026. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3830.03-3837.30: But what we are giving guidance on is the full scale CAPEX of Johansson, of Visting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3837.32-3842.04: 65 to 75 billion NOK, I think the number is, or thereabout. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3842.70-3849.39: So I think you can take your 35% net from that and you can roughly eyeball it because from. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3849.93-3855.32: Obviously we will have some Johan Sverdrup numbers in 2023 and beyond for drilling. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3855.80-3860.14: And there will also be the cake and frost developments in the Albahim area. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3860.78-3866.07: But as I said, the bulk of this will be visiting development. So I think you can eyeball roughly. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3866.99-3872.77: What 2027 and 28 expenditure will look like without knowing the exact facing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3873.49-3880.26: And of course the PDO on this thing hasn't been submitted as yet, so the caveat on this is of course also that... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3880.42-3885.05: We need to see a more exact facing of the CAPEX when we submit the. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3885.07-3886.39: Submit the PDO. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3887.61-3896.80: And then in terms of your free cash flow breakeven, I mean, we didn't feel it was appropriate for us given the deal with AccurBP to guide beyond 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3896.84-3899.04: Otherwise we normally would have done that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3899.74-3907.77: I think it suffices to say you again look at the CAPEX profile we're showing here and you see the growing production profile that we're showing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3908.53-3915.98: That should explain to you that the CAPEX intensity per barrel will remain low and our long-term OPEX guidance between $3 to $4. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3916.22-3923.58: A barrel is also a very low number and with reducing debt and cheaper debt with investment rates in place now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3923.60-3932.13: All the elements are in place for us to continue to have an extremely low free cash flow, a big even price for the business as we look forward. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3933.89-3938.66: And I think your question on the resources, so on the slide we said 240 million barrels. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3939.10-3945.33: In Whisting, we're 35% of the 500 million barrel discovery. So just shy of 180 of that is Whisting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3945.79-3950.41: The remainder net resources in the remaining four projects. Hope that helps. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3952.45-3956.82: Okay, thank you both. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3956.94-3963.20: Our next question comes from the line of Carl Peterson of ABG Sunville Collier. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3964.90-3966.97: Thank you guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3966.99-3970.61: Production profile for this year if you could elaborate on that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3970.63-3978.68: Magnitude of the birth trial program on Jons Fjordrup during the second quarter and also on Edvard Grieg. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3979.56-3984.90: How long will there be downtime on those assets? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3985.97-3987.53: And then looking ahead, I guess. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3989.37-3996.44: Otter, do you have any indications on the development of the regulatory process regarding the merger with or the transaction with OkrBP? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 3998.04-4002.56: So Dan, why don't you get the first one and I can take the second. No problem. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4002.78-4009.51: We're not going to give exact guidance for exactly how long it's going to be shut down because we have a range in our profiles. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4009.93-4016.12: I think you can see from Q1 and Q3 where there are no outages the rough level of where our production would normally sit. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4016.56-4024.24: And I think if you think in the order of a small number of weeks for those outages on both Edvard Grieg and Svedrup, that's around the right ballpark. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4026.89-4031.89: And in terms of the regulatory process for approval, as I mentioned when I spoke—. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4031.91-4040.12: For the transaction, both sets of shareholders will vote, ours at the end of March and Acker BP's early April. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4040.88-4051.01: We also have government approval to achieve and also competition authority approval in Norway. And those are the only real regulatory approvals. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4051.05-4052.47: That we have to get. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4053.19-4059.76: And I think our feeling is that those are really a formality. It just takes a bit of time, and that's why it takes from... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4059.78-4064.26: From now until around the middle of the year to close the transaction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4064.52-4065.57: You know. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4065.59-4078.74: I was very low risk to this deal not going ahead, given the nature of the shareholding of both companies and the quality of the transaction and the regulatory approvals that are required. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4081.32-4083.92: Hopefully that gives you a clear understanding. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4088.45-4096.92: Thank you. There's currently one further question in the phone lines. So just as a reminder to participants, if you do wish to ask a question, please dial 01 now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4097.86-4102.46: The next question comes from Al Stanton of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4103.76-4106.21: Yes, good afternoon guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4106.81-4108.15: Just two simple questions, really. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4108.57-4113.27: With respect to development and exploration spending in 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4113.33-4114.51: Can you give us any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4114.53-4123.72: Flavour of the timing, whether it's just chunked in 25% per quarter or whether there's any additional guidance or colour you'd provide on that, whether there's any heavy quarters. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4124.20-4130.93: And then a separate question on gas. I'm just wondering if gas sales are purely driven by the GOR or whether. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4130.95-4133.13: You know, there is some pressure maintenance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4133.65-4141.84: That consumes gas that you might be able to redirect towards additional gas sales, as you've mentioned, with the electrification of Fed degree. Thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4142.38-4144.38: Down one, you cover both of those. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4145.21-4150.39: Yeah, firstly on the gas side, I think most of its associated gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4150.41-4156.90: We don't have a big gas injection program that we can swing in and move the amounts of produced gas. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4156.94-4163.46: I think, Al, the amount of gas production you've seen over the past period, you'll probably see going forwards as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4164.12-4166.29: And I think the E&A and development spending. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4166.55-4175.80: Most of, if we focus on the appraisal spending first, most of that is linked to studies and activities towards the PDOs, so I think you'll see that roughly spread over the course of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4176.22-4179.78: And similarly with the exploration spend. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4179.80-4188.83: It'll be spread between the wells and with five wells spread over the course of the year, you'll see a rough spread rather than all of it being done in one quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4193.23-4199.18: And the development spend of 590 is that basically whatever it is, 150 a quarter, the best guidance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4200.24-4208.15: Yes, and Taito, you jump in if there's anything to add. So, Johans Fedrup makes up a big portion of the development spend there. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4208.51-4216.52: And most of that will be spent as you roll between now evenly until you get into the final commissioning and start-up phase. So you'll see that. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4216.54-4219.00: Fairly linearly over the course of the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4219.34-4224.66: And then depending on the final out term on cost, we may see some of that coming out over time. Let's see. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4225.75-4229.89: On the remaining spend, we will finish the development drilling on Solvay in Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4230.37-4235.86: And so you won't see heavy development spend in the Edvard Grieg area after that period. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4236.20-4243.12: Other than for the Edvard Grieg Power From Shore project which will be linear through most of the year until we get into the commissioning at the end. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4243.64-4251.65: I think you should roughly see most of this, Al, on both the development and E&A spread fairly evenly through the year. Obvious ups and downs as you go. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4253.81-4254.97: Sure, perfect, thank you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4256.98-4264.64: Thank you. We've had one further question come through on the phone lines. That's from James Thompson at GAP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4266.19-4270.15: Thanks, guys, for the presentation. Just a quick one from me. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4271.37-4280.52: Obviously, stronger oil price backdrop, everyone's making a little bit more money in the upstream. I just wondered if you could maybe talk to us a little bit about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4281.42-4293.55: The differentials, particularly on the low-carbon crew front, the idea that you may well start to get a bit of a premium for Sverdrup Cargo because of the low-carbon nature and also Edward Grieve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4293.63-4298.50: Feels like the environment is probably better to be testing the water on that, could you maybe talk a little bit about. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4298.72-4303.56: You know, any success or otherwise that you've had in trying to capture some of that Delta. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4304.24-4305.81: Taita, do you want to have a go? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4306.55-4308.87: Yeah, I can. Hi, James. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4310.33-4317.24: I mean, it's been a story we've been telling for some time now and we've been working really hard at getting to the great position we now are in. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4317.38-4322.28: Which means that sort of 60% of our production is produced carbon neutrally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4322.88-4331.61: And it's actually fully certified both in terms of the emissions and also the offsets that we have purchased for Johans Ferry Group. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4332.17-4337.94: So it essentially means that every time we now lift a Jons Rydger cargo, it is essentially a carbon zero. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4338.06-4339.08: Cargo. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4339.90-4350.33: YSY is still not showing through in the numbers we presented today, but we have actually now sold a few cargos on Jansfer with a carbon premium implied. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4350.41-4357.14: On the overall price is still selling at a discount to Dated Brain, but at a lower discount than... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4357.24-4358.64: It otherwise would have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4358.76-4362.54: But I would say the numbers are relatively modest at the moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4362.66-4364.52: But we continue to. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4364.54-4369.53: To tell the story and to articulate the benefits to our buyers from buying carbon neutral cargoes. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4369.55-4375.62: And we firmly believe that over time that will be manifested in the prices we are going to achieve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4380.60-4388.11: Thank you. There are no further questions on the phones at this time, so I'll hand back to the room for the questions from the webcast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4389.65-4398.26: Thanks very much, Mark. I'm just checking on the web here. I think because of our unbelievably good disclosure, there's no further questions from the web either. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4399.06-4408.25: So with that, I'll draw the meeting to a close. But if anyone has any other questions that they need answering, please don't hesitate to drop me a line. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4409.07-4410.33: And we can take it offline. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 4410.47-4412.09: So thanks very much for joining. 
asr:0: END
