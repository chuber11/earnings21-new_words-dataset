asr:0: OUTPUT 1395.36-1399.98: With a clear potential to break even for the year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1401.40-1410.73: This will be supplemented by partnerships and new programs to drive even higher growth opportunities. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1412.27-1416.00: We are also advancing on our ESG journey. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1417.24-1425.47: And right after the Q&A session, we will share with you our new ESG commitments. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1426.49-1436.16: I invite everyone, therefore, to remain online for this ESG event, which will start just after the results Q&A. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1438.06-1442.82: Also, we are looking forward to a new chapter of Embraer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1442.90-1448.13: With our extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for next Monday. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1449.03-1456.52: We expect our shareholders to approve the election of two international board members. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1456.72-1461.82: With extensive global aerospace industry experience. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1462.74-1470.53: Following constructive feedback from analysts and shareholders to improve our corporate governance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1471.99-1481.20: These candidates have deep technical knowledge, strategic profiles, and an innovative thought process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1482.50-1489.23: Finally, I will close today by thanking everyone for this strong quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1490.25-1498.08: It always starts with our people and their focus and passion on executing our strategic planning. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1499.44-1505.45: As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we are a different company today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1506.45-1510.87: We are in a process of transformation and we are moving fast. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1512.37-1518.58: Thank you for your interest and confidence in our company. Over to you, Felipe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1525.49-1530.75: Thank you very much Francisco. And before we continue, we'd like to show you a video. Check this out. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1532.97-1538.82: A different place to a year ago. Industries have changed. Aviation perhaps more than any. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1540.00-1546.01: The Breyer has changed too. We're leaner, more agile, and fit for growth. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1546.83-1550.01: We're already on a path that will make us bigger and stronger. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1550.63-1557.22: And with an all new product portfolio that are the most efficient and technologically advanced in their class. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1557.54-1565.85: All built with the passion to improve sustainability, economics, cost efficiencies, and driving new innovations. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1566.13-1569.77: Were better adapted to the challenges and opportunities of now. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1570.63-1576.14: Like our customers, we're always looking above and beyond what was previously thought possible. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1576.64-1578.96: That's why the world looks to Embraer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1579.36-1588.37: We're right for the world ahead. Right now. Embraer. Challenge. Create. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1588.39-1589.61: Outperform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1591.73-1600.64: And now let's move on to our questions and answer session. We are preparing the set here. And remember that questions can only be sent through the Reuters platform. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1601.20-1605.45: Eduardo Couto will be our moderator and he already has some questions with him. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1605.93-1607.35: Eduardo, over to you. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1619.88-1624.48: Let me see the questions that we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1625.59-1631.61: The first question we have is, can you give an update on the SPAC negotiations with Yves? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1632.05-1637.42: I don't know if Francisco or Antonio wants to take that. Yes, thank you, Edu. Thanks for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1638.34-1646.37: At this point of time, we can say that the negotiation is moving very well, I would say. We are very optimistic with this process. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1648.61-1653.69: Okay. Moving on to questions. Second question we have. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1654.77-1663.52: What work has Embraer been doing to develop electric aircraft and making this product more viable for customers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1663.82-1672.63: Thank you. That was a good question. We had our first technical flight recently with the Ipanema full electric. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1673.23-1677.72: And we hope to present this aircraft to the public soon. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1678.36-1680.40: And continue to invest. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1680.68-1682.96: In this electrification field. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1683.10-1685.25: As one of the... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1685.27-1698.92: One of the innovation fronts that we have to be in line with the ESG activities that we are moving fast in Embraer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1700.80-1706.25: The third question we have from investors is from Vitor Misuzaki from Bradesco. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1706.73-1715.46: He said the fence showed a material gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Can you give her more details about that, Antonio? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1717.64-1718.94: Victor, thanks for the question. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1719.62-1722.76: We had in the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1722.84-1724.50: To me, facts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1724.52-1733.17: On the defense side. First one was the super cannon deliver that we were not able to deliver in Q1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1733.61-1735.80: That flows to the Q2 figures. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1736.66-1745.21: In addition to it, we have the adjustment in the defense contract we have in the local currency in Brazil. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1745.41-1757.10: I would say both effects, higher deliveries and super Tucano and the adjustment in the contracts lead us to this 25% margin in Q2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1761.52-1762.92: Okay, very good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1763.88-1766.61: Next question comes from UBS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1767.95-1772.79: Could you comment on the 25 million reversal mentioned in the press release? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1773.25-1781.66: Also, what was the positive cost-based revision related on the results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1783.16-1790.71: So thanks for the question. First point, we built up a provision in 2018 for the Brazilian guys. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1790.89-1799.44: The. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1799.56-1803.08: To gain this claim in second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1803.40-1806.31: That's why we reversed this text position. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1806.81-1812.77: That was also already adjusted in 2018. That's why we also consider in our results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1814.47-1824.46: The second question was in regards to the contracts. We have an adjustment here around $10 million in the second quarter. That were both effects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1825.29-1833.91: It's important also to mention that even that we have this tax reversal, $25 million, let's put first quarter and second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1834.63-1837.90: We do have other types of costs that we are not adjusting. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1838.20-1840.00: That's also not, I would say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1840.90-1845.39: For example, reintegration of commercial aviation and arbitration costs. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1845.61-1855.20: Which is more or less net this 25 million, I would say. The numbers we are seeing right now, I would say, combined Q1 and Q2 is really. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1855.22-1859.74: For me, describe the real performance of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1863.36-1866.51: We have several questions about Eve. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1866.53-1875.08: I will try to summarize them. So basically, any general updates on your eVTOL initiatives would be very helpful. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1875.10-1877.94: Particularly on negotiations with Zenite. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1878.38-1880.00: We already talked a little bit, but maybe. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1881.64-1889.43: Francisco and Tony. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1890.13-1899.32: We had the first flight with the prototype, scale 1 to 3, a successful test by the way. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1899.74-1906.07: Now we are preparing the next test with the prototype scale 1 to 1. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1906.65-1916.64: And technically it's moving very well. We are planning the certification by 2025 and entering service in 2026. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1917.00-1920.64: And about the negotiation with Zanaita I mentioned already, that's moving very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1922.58-1923.70: Okay, very good. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1924.22-1928.13: Now moving to business jets, we have a question from Credit Suisse. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1929.63-1930.83: Uh... 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1930.85-1939.74: BusinessJet has been very strong, and on the first quarter results, you mentioned half of the deliverers were for first-time buyers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1939.90-1941.30: In the second quarter. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1941.42-1943.40: How much were first-time buyers? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1943.70-1945.93: Maybe we can give an overview of the business jet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1946.23-1954.61: I can do it. I would say today in our backlog, the portion of first time buyers,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1954.89-1960.70: I would say is a third, something like 30% in your backlog and deliveries for the whole year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1961.12-1963.62: We are talking about 30% first-time buyers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1964.36-1967.21: And we are going with the market if you see the industry. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1967.81-1975.36: Book to be between 1 to 5, 2 to 1, 1 to 5 to 1, and 2 to 1 to 2. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1975.66-1985.63: And we are, I would say, a little bit above that and doing pretty well, but for sure the first place pushing also the market especially in the light jets category. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1988.33-1992.11: Now there is a question on commercial from Credit Suisse. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 1992.99-2002.08: Your guidance for commercial delivers of 45 to 50 seems low given you have already delivered 23 jets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2003.04-2009.99: Are there any supply chain issues that could prevent you from being above that range? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2011.37-2017.90: Also, they are asking what do you see in terms of delivers for 2022, any color on that? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2020.28-2025.17: Let's take into account that commercial aviation is still suffering from the pandemic. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2026.53-2031.37: What we are giving as guidance to deliver this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2031.95-2041.22: Is a little bit higher than last year. Last year we delivered 44 and for sure we are selling more but it's going to impact more 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2041.80-2045.75: And the fact that we deliver at 23 aircrafts. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2046.07-2053.73: It's because it's well divided throughout the year. That's why the 47. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2055.82-2058.22: I would say between 45 to 50. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2058.68-2066.15: Is the number we are having and we do see, I would say, around 30% for next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2066.25-2069.45: Between 65 to 70 aircraft. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2069.65-2073.49: But has to be confirmed, but it's more or less the number you're seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2073.83-2075.05: It's important to mention. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2075.40-2080.48: We do see commercial aviation coming back to historical levels at the Embraer. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2081.52-2083.60: From 2003 onwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2083.68-2092.17: We are selling more, but the sales country we are closing right now is going to fulfill this kind of line starting 2022. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2092.59-2097.00: And 2021 is more or less the same level from 2020. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2100.00-2105.13: I would like to make a link between this answer and the result of the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2105.57-2112.95: It is true that in this first half of the year, comparing to the first half of last year, we did much better. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2113.05-2116.12: In terms of deliveries, in terms of results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2116.18-2118.14: The numbers speak by themselves. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2118.60-2124.96: But if you look at the guides for the entire year, you see that, no, S-Planet. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2125.17-2131.43: We won't see a huge increase in volumes in the commercial or executive. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2131.71-2137.10: Yes, we are seeing some growth, moderate growth this year compared to the last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2137.68-2139.62: But the improvement in their results. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2140.00-2145.45: I mean either the EBIT coming from almost minus 3% last year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2145.47-2148.31: To something between 3 and 4 percent this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2148.59-2155.92: Or the free cash flow from minus 900 million last year to something between minus 150 and zero this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2156.30-2161.60: All this good performance is coming from efficiency gains, pure efficiency gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2161.92-2164.54: We really did a good right size in the organization. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2164.84-2170.65: We are improving a lot of activities on cost reduction, on inventory reduction. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2170.67-2175.04: In all the company, you know, I mean, pushing the sales for the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2175.34-2177.62: So again, I mean, from next year on. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2177.78-2185.81: I mean, we expect that with a stronger growth in the volumes, in all the business units. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2186.01-2191.53: And with this more efficient and agile company, then you see much better performance. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2191.73-2199.14: So that's why our result is coming from this year, from efficiency gains, from some additional sales, of course, but mainly from efficiency gains. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2200.00-2203.82: To complete the question for supply chain. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2204.82-2209.79: What we are putting the guidance in, what we agreed with our customers for this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2210.23-2216.12: At least for the commercial version, have not seen any supplier chain problems this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2220.00-2225.61: Several other questions. So the next one is related to margins and free cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2225.93-2230.69: So the question is, how do we see margins per business in the long term? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2231.23-2238.96: And what sort of free cash flow conversion, EBITDA into free cash flow conversion does Embraer expect? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2241.10-2248.61: So in regards to margin, we do see that's in a long-term perspective. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2248.71-2252.89: We do see service and support at DoubleDigit as it is today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2253.85-2256.08: We do see executive in this sense. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2256.72-2261.20: Single higher dish, and we are more or less also today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2261.56-2264.98: And with the commercial aviation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2265.85-2272.41: I would say mid-single digit, close between 3% to 5% in the long term. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2272.61-2276.38: That's what we see in regards to profitability for the company. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2277.04-2285.27: And in regards to the conversion from EBITDA to EBITDA, I would prefer to talk, we are seeing today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2285.71-2289.29: A 50% conversion from EBIT to cash flow. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2289.67-2294.61: We still needed to improve something, but it's more or less the metrics I'm using internally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2294.97-2301.44: We do see today in the long run 50% of their BIT being converted into cash. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2301.48-2302.72: For the years to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2304.36-2308.19: So the next question is from JP Morgan, Marcelo Motta. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2308.73-2315.32: Any update on the sales campaigns for commercial aviation? Could we see more orders during the second quarter? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2317.20-2324.08: Good question, yes, we have a lot of active sales campaigns ongoing in our commercial aviation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2324.64-2331.99: We just announced the sales for SkyWest with 16 aircraft and yes, we have more to come. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2332.77-2340.14: By the way, the SkyOS is not part of the backlog in Q2. We are going to book. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2340.16-2342.78: These 70 aircrafts in Q3. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2343.94-2346.69: 17 aircraft, correct. Thank you, Antonio. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2348.73-2351.97: There is a question here from Lucas from Santander. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2352.79-2362.50: Talking about inflation, can you please comment on how the company is seeing the raw material inflation and how is the company offsetting this impact? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2363.60-2368.11: I would say we do see in our final products. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2368.55-2373.95: Inflation, I would say, all index we have with our suppliers. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2374.03-2382.44: Between 2 to 3% for next year. And to the customer side, we have also the readjustment clause. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2382.62-2384.08: With the index, I would say. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2384.36-2388.11: Our takeaway for next year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2388.31-2393.41: Is a balance between what you have internally inflation and the pass through to the customer base. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2393.73-2394.99: That's more or less what we are seeing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2395.26-2399.54: But there is in some indicators a spike in deflation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2399.62-2406.75: In the index for next year that we are going to discuss for our customer base. Moreover,. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2406.83-2410.19: We do have, we did this year and we are doing this year. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2410.51-2418.90: And we do have also a lot of design to value activities inside Embraer to reduce the base of the cost we have today. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2419.60-2422.80: Without any impact on any inflation or indicators. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2424.24-2426.89: Very good. So now moving to new projects. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2426.91-2434.53: There is a question from Rio Verde Investimentos. Any update on the partnerships for the turboprop aircraft? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2436.00-2439.80: That was a good question. Well, this front is also moving very well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2440.24-2447.19: Especially with the recent interest of US airlines in that product. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2447.59-2455.10: So we see that product as a good alternative for that market and other markets as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2455.22-2459.38: And also as a preparation for new technology in the future. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2459.72-2465.87: So we are very optimistic and working hard to accelerate this partnership. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2471.17-2476.00: I think we have at least one final question. It's back to commercial aviation. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2476.44-2479.58: What do you expect? It's from WTS. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2480.00-2484.16: What do you expect in the midst of long-term commercial aviation? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2484.18-2491.37: As we are seeing recovering demand for flights and also renewal for having more sustainable fleets. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2493.35-2496.30: Thank you. So again, we have a. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2496.76-2498.58: I mean, globally. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2498.66-2504.30: 94% of the Embraer fleet back in the skies. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2504.52-2510.27: In the U.S. 97% of the fleet is flying again. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2510.77-2516.48: So it shows that the recovery in the domestic market really is coming. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2516.92-2526.67: And that's why we are working in a lot of sales campaigns in that segment for E1s and E2s as well. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2527.03-2532.31: So we are working hard to take advantage of this moment. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2532.51-2535.64: As Antonio mentioned, we see volumes growing. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2535.82-2544.02: I mean 2020 but strongly from 2000, 2022 but strongly from 2023 onwards. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2546.81-2556.14: I think a final question, it's related to defense. Can you please comment on the expectations for new KC-390 orders? 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2557.66-2560.34: It's, as I said in the opening. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2560.48-2568.55: We are working in many sales campaigns for import sales campaigns for the KC390 and also. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2568.99-2578.54: I mean, we are working to develop partnerships that will help us to open new markets for that great aircraft. 
asr:0: OUTPUT 2581.76-2583.98: I think that's what we had on the Q&A.
