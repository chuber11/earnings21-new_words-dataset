<unk> Welcome to the Gol Airlines Third Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. 
This morning, the company made its numbers available, along with three videos with the results presentation, financial review, and preliminary Q 
& A. Gol hopes that everyone connected has watched them. 
After the company's brief remarks, we will initiate the Q & A session, when further instructions will be provided. 
This event is also being broadcast live via webcast, 
and may be accessed through the company website at www.voegol.com .vr/ir and 
on the MZIQ platform at www.mziq.com. 
Those following the presentation via the webcast may post their questions on the platform, and their questions will either be answered by the management during this call, 
or by the Gol Investor Relations Team after the conference is finished. 
Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Gol's management 
and on information currently available to the company. 
They involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur. 
Investors and analysts should understand that events related to macroeconomic conditions, 
industry, and other factors could also cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. 
At this time, I will hand you over to Mr. Paul Kakinoff, CEO. Please begin. 
Good morning everyone, and welcome to Gol Airlines Quarterly Earnings Call. I would like to start by highlighting our most important achievements of this spirit. 
The first one was the continued recovery in demand, which showed solid growth during the third quarter. 
At the end of September, Brazil became fourth among all countries with the most vaccines administered against COVID-19. 
Approximately 56% of Brazil's population is fully vaccinated, and over 74% have received their first dose, 
a higher percentage than the vast majority of the countries, including the United States. 
Similar to demand trends in other markets, the rising vaccination rate in the general population is supporting the air markets' ongoing recovery. 
As a result, Gol's departures in the third quarter grew by 87%, reaching 52% of the levels in 2019. 
In response to this demand, Gol is expanding its network, and has already announced a new route from Congoines to Bonito. It's starting in this December. 
We are taking a conservative approach to increasing capacity as travel demand recovers to help maintain high load factors and profitability in our routes. 
The second important event was a transition of the fleet to Boeing Max 8. 
In preparation for this strong recovery in air travel that we expect to see in the coming quarters, 
we sign agreements to accelerate the transformation of our fleet, with the acquisition of 28 additional Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. 
This initiative is expected to reduce the company's unit cost by 8% in 2022. 
Because of the new contract, we will end 2021 with 28 new Max Aircraft, which represents 20% of the fleet. 
By the end of 2022, we expect to have 44 Max Aircraft, raising this total to 32%. 
With purchase commitments, we will meet our 2030 goal of having 75% of the fleet in this new aircraft. 
And, as is widely recognized, the Max is 15% more fuel- efficient, 
generates 60% less carbon emissions, and is 40% quieter compared to the MG. 
This aircraft has positioned us to grow even more competitively, expanding routes to new destinations and providing efficiency gains, 
all of which will capture more value for all our stakeholders. 
The full important achievement was the conclusion of the merger with MIOS into GLE. 
This transaction will generate great value from several operation synergies, as well as new opportunities and strategies that will become even more significant during the airline market recovery. 
We're optimistic that the synergies from this corporate reorganization, expected to be approximately $3 billion reais in net present value for the next five years, 
and the subsequent values to our shareholders will be realized in a relatively short period of time. 
With that, I will hand the floor over to Richard, our CFO, who will present some financial highlights. 
Thank you, Kak. Our most recent notable event was the success of our liability management program. 
In September, we issued $150 million in a re-tap at 8% annual interest rate 
on our senior secured notes, maturing in 2026. 
Moody's assigned the notes a rating of B2. 
Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including aircraft acquisitions and working capital. 
In October, we re-financed our short-term bank debt, in the amount of $1.2 billion reais by an extension of the seventh series of debentures 
and the issuance of our eighth series of simple, non-convertible debentures. 
This re-financing enabled the company to return to its lowest level of short-term debt since 2014 at about a half a billion reais, 
which will also improve Gol's credit metrics by better matching future assets and liabilities, and reducing the average cost of debt. 
Our next relevant maturity date for outstanding debt is not until July 
2024. Gol's balance sheet is now in a better position in terms of our outstanding debt, versus our peers, which we view to be a competitive advantage in the current market environment. 
In addition, the company advertised around $518 million reais of debt in this quarter, 
the average maturity of Gol's long-term debt, excluding aircraft leases and perpetual notes, 
is approximately 3.4 years, with the mean obligations already addressed in our cash flow. 
The net debt ratio, excluding exchangeable notes and perpetual bonds, to adjusted last twelve months we've adopted, was 9.7 times on September 30, 2021, 
representing the lowest financial leverage among peers. 
Considering the amounts fundable from deposits and unencumbered assets, 
the company's potential sources of liquidity resulted in approximately $6.1 billion reais of accessible liquidity. 
The recent capitalization of the balance sheet, with capital increase led by the majority shareholder, 
represented the recognition of Gol's value as Brazil's largest airline with the best product. 
The re-financing of our short-term bank debt in October, added to long-term capital of $2.7 billion reais raised in the second and third quarters of this year, 
totals over $3.9 billion reais in the last seven months. 
As far as a discussion of financial results for the quarter, it was shared this morning in the video presentation, and we believe you all had a chance to access that. 
In short, our work to re-establish operating margins that can support the sustained growth of operations is bearing fruit. 
We ended the third quarter with an EBIT reaching $330 million reais and an operating margin totalling 17.7%. 
Concurrently, adjusted EBITDA $446 million reais with a 24.3% margin, evidencing our successful efforts at matching supply and demand. 
I will now return back over to Kakinoff. 
Thanks Richard. We have seen a recovery in demand for air travel, and we believe that now, with greater population immunization, and the significant expansion of vaccination, 
we will have a strong fourth quarter, 
coinciding with the start of the summer season. 
I would like to close by thanking our employees, the team of RIGOS, who are working with extreme professionalism and commitment. 
All this adaption puts us in a solid position to expand operations and achieve profitable growth. 
We reiterate our confidence that Gol will re-emerge as strong and even more resilient as markets normalize. 
Now, I would like to initiate the Q & A session. 
Thank you. The conference call is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press * 1 at this or any time. 
If at any point your question is answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing * 2. 
We ask that when you ask your questions, speak close to the receiver of the device, so that everyone can hear you clearly. 
Participants can also send questions via the webcast platform. 
You need to click on the? In the upper-left hand corner and type in your question. Please hold while we poll for questions. 
Our first question is from Steven Trent with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Good morning, gentlemen and thanks very much for taking my questions. 
I just kind of wanted, you know, your high-level views on international demand to the U.S. spooling up again. 
You know, now that you're partnered with American Airlines, you know, what sort of bigger opportunities are you seeing on the horizon, 
and do you see any opportunity as well for American to possibly increase its stake in Gol in some point in the future? Hi Steven, Kakinoff here, good morning. 
Thank you very much for your question. Let me give you an overview on the North American market specifically. 
Uh, firstly you know we are, uh, now gradually reaching our international goals. 
So we have already made available the ticket sales for Cancun in Mexico, Dominicans, for the Dominican Republic, 
and we are now resuming Montevideo and Buenos Aires. So, the 
United States, 
uh, will be likely the route to be added in our international portfolio by the end of the second quarter of next year. 
And it is because, you're right, 
with the borders are now open to the Brazilians, but, 
and there is a considerable but, which is, uh, the, the, the, default, the exchange rate 
made, made the purchase, the ticket purchase and the whole trip cost, including hotels, train and car 
expense, pretty expensive from the Brazilian perspective. 
Uh, you know the real has the devaluated quite significantly along the last quarter, 
so the Brazilian economic 
conditions, uh, also, was, uh, were affected during the, the last three months. 
And the combination of a real excitement 
to resume international trips has a great contrast with the important constraint imposed by the exchange rate. 
So the passengers are willing to fly, mainly to the United States, 
but that, that trip became quite, quite expensive at the moment. 
So, uh, I cannot say there is a boom 
related to North American ticket, to, related to airline tickets, uh, to fly to the United States. 
Uh, you know, we are about to begin the Brazilian high season, December and January. 
And uh, typically, 
that's the period when you see more passengers willing to travel for leisure purpose. 
It is not going to be different this year, maybe it's slightly better for the international markets. 
And the second constraint, which is also affecting demand, is 
that there is a backlog to provide North American visas to the Brazilians, which we will not be, uh, solved, or rather addressed in the forecast. 
So if you have five members… a family of five members, 
uh, it's very much likely that at least one of them has no valid visa, uh, at the moment, 
making not possible to, to fly to the United States. 
So all those things combined, uh, are affecting the potential, uh, uh, flight catch-up that we could get, if not by this, this, two constraints, 
and finally in our case, 
we have the partnership with American Airlines, who has already deployed a, a considerable 
capacity increase for the following three months. 
So we have decided to support, uh, that investment 
by selling, not the American Airlines tickets in our channels, as we done already since April 2020, 
uh, and to that strategy we are simultaneously attending our customers 
and, uh, supporting this additional capacity increase supplied by American Airlines, our partner. 
So we believe that, this is the, the best strategy to cope with the current demand, 
and then we will, uh, resume our out flight from Brasilia to Florida, 
uh, where a market which has not been attended by American Airlines at the moment from the second quarter next year on. 
So, this is, I mean, an overview of the North American market from the Brazilian perspective in the airline segment. 
Super Kaki, really appreciate that. And, and, just very quickly, just one last thing, uh. On business travel, any high-level trends you're seeing in the domestic market? And let me leave it at that, thank you. 
We, uh, we might be surprised by the speed, 
uh, to which the business segment is recovering 
the, uh, the, uh, its pre-pandemic level. 
We are now verifying that, and identifying, actually, that some specific segments in Brazil 
is catching up its business-… is, u- uh, catching up, uh, its business travel behavior. 
Uh, even above the, the pre-pandemic level, those are the services, y- uh, generally speaking. 
Uh, mainly those, those companies pretty much, uh, uh, uh, benefited by, by the new customer behavior. 
So like food delivery, just say, uh, uh, one example, and, and E-commerce, 
so those segments, uh, of Boeing. And they are probably <laugh> more than they were, 
uh, before, th- uh, the pandemic. And also, 
uh, some i- if I could say so, some other traditional segments, uh, those are pretty strong in, in Brazil. Uh, such as the agricultural business, oil and gas, and inaudible industries. 
So we, we foresee that by the beginning of the next year, we might be above our prior projection, which has… Consider that one-third of the business travelers would be gone for good, 
which might be not the case. 
So i- i- it, it's, it's too early to be precise, uh, u- uh, on that projection, 
but, uh, at this, this moment, we see that some, uh, segments are recovering faster than the next sector. 
Great. Thank you very much, Khaki. Thank you. The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Oh, yeah, hey. Good morning, everybody. Um, 
I wanna just, um, kinda run through liquidity, and I wanna make sure I'm sorta comparing apples to apples here. 
So, Sep 2, your total liquidity, it looked like it ended at 2.1 billion reais, and you're guiding to 3.8 at year-end. 
Is that, um, Rich, is that predominantly the American Airlines investment and an improvement, or an increase in your ATL? 
Or is there other things we should be mindful of? 
Yeah, no, 
the… You know, any, any transaction that's not closed is not in those numbers. 
So that, that is not in those numbers, Michael, nor is new additional, uh, capital reason. 
Um, the, the Q3 number, uh, and I'll, I'll walk you through that. Q3 number 
which was composed of the, the 4 billion reais that you mentioned, 
which is about, uh, 1.1 billion of cash investments, about 300 million reais 
of restricted cash, about 600 million reais of accounts receivable, and 1.9 billion reais of deposits. 
Uh, the way that would break down in the Q4 would be about ni- uh, uh, 
900 to a billion reais of cash and investments, about th- uh, which is down around, uh, 200 million reais. 
Because as we ramp up, uh, to the high season and get our fleet back up above 100 operating aircraft, we're investing in working capital, spare parts, 
if you will, to, 
um, uh, get all these aircraft up and flying. 
So that, that's effectively going into, uh, assets, uh, but it's obviously consuming some liquidity. And to some extent, it's also 
increasing our spare parts inventory which, uh, supports the collateral in our Senior Secured Notes program. Uh- Uh- 
The restricted cash, uh, will be a similar balance of around 300 million reais. Uh- Yep, yep. 
Accounts receivable, accounts receivable increases, about 200 million reais to 800 million 
reais. That's obviously associated with the, um, ramp up in operations. You know, we expect that by Q1, we 
should be back, uh, to a more normalized level accounts receivable, 
which would be, you know, somewhere between 1 to 1.2 billion reais. Okay. 
The deposit amount, the deposit amount goes down, uh, from the Q3 to the Q4 
by about 100 million reais. Because as we, uh, as we return aircraft, 
uh, you know, we use some of those, uh, security deposits as well as, uh, the inaudible deposits to cost out, 
uh, the return inaudible. 'Cause u- if you know, we're accelerating our transition from the MGs to the masses, 
and so we're using, 
um, those deposits to cost out aircraft re-deliveries. 
Which is why as we said, you know, we do have axos- access to those deposits as it relates to the, to the asset that they're supporting. 
And, um, and so that's why we include that number in our liquidity. 
So that, that basically, there's no external capital raising in there, it's all operational. 
So the, the difference, which is- Oh- Around you know, that total number down from 4 billion to, uh, 
3.8 billion. 
It basically represents an investment in working capital, uh, spare parts, to, uh, end the year with, uh, a little over 100 operating aircraft. 
Okay. So that, okay, that's helpful. So it's, it's flat-edged, to slightly down, before anything, and we know that we're… You know, hopeful that- Well, you know, the crosstalk 
capital raising in there. As you know, we have, in addition to that, and kinda maybe taking advantage of your question. 'Cause we have some questions on how do we get to the 6.1 billion of liquidity. 
Uh, in addition to what I described, 
you know, we have, 
uh, potential connecting sources of, uh, based on 
inaudible, uh, unencumbered assets that we have of a little over 2 billion reais. 
And so how we get to the 6 billion, the additional 2 billion, uh, comes out of unencumbered assets. About half of that 
is the collateral we have, uh, through the loyalty program. 
You know, in the Q3 we finalized the take in of the loyalty program, so we control 100% of those assets 
and the additional collateral, uh, we had, uh, in spare parts, in all actual property. 
Uh, which if we wanted to could be deposited into our Senior Secure Notes program, uh, for raising additional capital. 
We have no plans currently, 
uh, to do anything with this additional collateral. But it is important to highlight that the unencumbered assets that we have 
represents a potish- a potential additional 2 billion reais of long-term capital, should we, uh, uh, choose to pursue that. 
Okay, now that's super helpful. 
And then, just, um… You know, you, you're always helpful in sorta calling out, 
you know, the call it, the non o- operating expenses associated with fleet 
idleness and personal related costs. And in this quarter, this fourth quarter, it looks like it's just gonna be under a billion reais. Now, over the year, that number has actually moved up meaningfully, despite the fact that you are putting more people and planes back into service. 
So I don't know, is that, is that an FX 
related issue, what's driving that number? Or am I just, my logic in thinking that as you put more people and planes back to work, and that that should go down. 
That, that logic's… 
That maybe there's something wrong there and how it's being accounted for. If you could just detail that. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, 
I think what you, I think it says a depreciation affect, uh, Michael, which is a non cash affect in there. 
Okay. Um, but let me, let me, let me get back to that because that's a more technical calculation. 
But obviously in that, 
you know, in the unit cost, uh, is the depreciation. And so, uh, part of it, uh, relates to that. 
Um, also, you know, in the Q3, uh, you know the number… In the Q3, the number of flights is still reduced. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and so there's a, there's a substantial ramp up in the, um, in the Q4. 
Okay. And, uh, that will kinda revert back. But in the, in the Q3, also in the month of, uh, September as you know, 
we sc- had to scale back a little bit, uh, given the transition of our PSS. 
Uh, which in fact did our, you know, our scale, and our, our revenues, and, and our ability to, uh, improve, uh, inaudible pollution, you know, because of the migration to the, 
uh, new revenue system which was done in August and, um, and September. 
But in, in the Q3, you know, we had, uh, uh, 70, uh, aircraft operators. And so we still had 60 aircraft still idle in the Q3. 
And so what you're seeing there is, in, in the Q3, is the effect of those 60 aircraft, 
um, still idle. Uh, that number at the end of the Q4 will be reduced to, you know, hopefully less than 30. 
Uh- Nom- And, and so those, those, uh, you know… And we're, 
we're trying to, you know, separate that out. I think we're one of the few companies that tries to separate that our for you guys. You know, we're separating the idle costs versus the, um, total. 
Uh, but we'll probably only see a normalization on a, on a unit cost basis for comparative purposes in the Q1. 'Cause we're still gonna have, you know, idle c- idle, idle costs in the Q4. 
What's, uh, now… When you say normal in Q1, are you, are you saying that approaches zero 
in Q1? Or, I, I'm just assuming it gets to zero by the back part of 2022. But maybe, maybe it gets there sooner? Oh, no, no, no, no. In the, in the Q1 it goes again, 
we're, you know, we've returned aircraft. Uh, we 
are, uh, thi- this Q4 is, uh, activation of a majority of the grounded aircraft. 
And as we get into the January, February high season, 
you know, we might be a little bit in there in the Q4, but, uh, for the most part, we'll be eliminated. 
Now that you get into the, the normal season out, you know, 
Q2 for us is kind of a down, uh, seasonality normally. We'll have to see where Aldi… In fact, he said, we could have some positive surprises on the corporate demand- 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, uh, making the Q2 of next year a little bit, uh, better than we might normally see. 
But, uh, for us, the Q1, 
because again, you know, we're 100% domestic focused. 
And we don't have inaudible. We don't depend on the international piece. 
And you know, the right size that we did on our capacity, on our fleet if you will, uh, should kind of, you know, triangulate to, 
you know, going back to more or less normalize the operating efficiency by end of December, beginning of January. 
Okay, great. And thanks for that, Rich. Thanks, everyone. Sure. 
The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. 
Oh, hey. Good morning, guys. 
Um, couple questions here. 
I guess, um, first, another question on the corporate recovery. Big picture, you know, what are you hearing from corporate customers today on their travel plans for next year? 
And then just related to that, 
you know, given the FX volatility, I believe there's a certain percent of the revenue that actually benefits from a weaker Brazilian real. So I'm, you know, I'm thinking the oil and gas sectors. I'm thinking agriculture. 
So it seems like there should be a component of the revenue there that should do a little better, um, you know, if the Brazilian real weakens. But you know, maybe you could clarify or, or even correct me on that? 
Yeah. Um, just… Firstly, the, uh, the, the customers inaudible. 
The, the large corporates, uh, they are basically saying they will resume flights from January 1. 
And it, it, it is somehow affected to their, uh, home office, uh, policy, which is for inaudible right into the, the end of this year. 
Uh, th- i- i- i- when we talk, it's specifically to those segments that have just repeated. 
Uh, they are already, uh, forming some travels ahead, but this is not even close to the, the potential 
they have for this, to the next year up. 
Uh, in a, in a side note, 
uh, really what we have is circular itself, to address that a specific month, 
via a new inaudible, will likely give us an additional, 
um, uh, set of inaudible. Because we can now, an- and they're much more flexible, and, uh, and inaudible. Uh, as well some, uh, uh, specific demands rated by the, the corporate cycle. 
So with the new, you have the combination of a better product with a redesigned network, with much, uh, 
activity, wh- uh, uh, uh, uh, the speed. 
Uh, we are now envisioning to, to have that t- to see that segment, uh, that, that specific segment catching up. Hm, yeah. But it d- 
I guess… Go ahead. I'm sorry, Rich. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. 
inaudible No, go ahead. Sorry, go. Uh, u- well, I guess, just tied to that point. I guess what I was, you know, trying to get at is, it, it seems like there should be some pent up demand, uh, next year. 
And so, I guess I just, um, uh, was thinking that there's potentially some more revenue upside here that, that folks might be under-appreciating. 
Um, but you know, going back to, I guess, you know, a question for Adu. Or, or, um, is just with respect to that inaudible that you just referenced. 
You know, the ability to market products in a way, digitally, that you haven't been able to historically. 
You know, so if you think about the grand vision, you know, what is the f- timeframe for exploiting that full capability? And you know, how material could that be? 
I think that it's gonna be… We 
have, or we are gonna have 100% of the, the improvements. I mean, inaudible, uh, to the end of this year. 
And that will be aggressive because those are marketing events. Uh, it will be inaudible customers around 80,000 to inaudible. Uh, it's really, 
really difficult to g- to give you a inaudible on how, uh, material those improvements can be. 
But we are now basically closing every single gap that we could get from a customer service point of view, 
uh, to a, a full legacy company. At the same t- 
additionally speaking, I mean, uh, I'm talking about digital service. Uh, at the same time that we are, uh, now u- uh, resuming the c- uh, 
the inaudible advantage that we always had. So I believe that a combination of inaudible we will… 
Uh, it's more than promising. It's something that, um, has a real, uh, positive affect, uh, our, our results. 
But I wouldn't like to, uh, because I couldn't at the moment, uh, to share any, any inaudible, um, on that expectation. 
Okay. Thanks for the time you guys. Thanks. 
Let me just, uh… Before we go to the next question on the sell side analysts, 
uh, let me weave in a question we have from, uh, one of our Brightside investors sending us questions on the platform. 
And I'll basically do that, uh, so that we don't have to save the, uh… People that sent the 
questions through the platform don't have to wait to the end of this. But we'll come back, um, in the next, uh, question from the sell side analysts after I go through, uh, this question from one of our 
inaudible investors. 
Um, it has three components on the results. 
Um, it explained what was the right off of deposits for aircraft leases, and… Uh, u- air- uh, aircraft lease deposits and maintenance and drift deposits. 
Uh, so just, uh, explain that to you, to an- to answer your question. In, in the cash flow in the quarter, 
in the third quarter, we recognized, uh, provisions for return of aircraft. There were 106… 176 million reais. 
Um, and against that, we, uh, were able to use and reverted, uh, 166 million reais of maintenance reserves. 
And then we-… 56 million reals of maintenance reserves. And then we, um, 
reduced, um… we have a, um, a, um, reduction in deposits of 264 million reals. 
And all this relates to what I was speaking about previously, but it ref- refers to, 
uh, us maintaining current, our maintenance provisions, uh, for, uh, the transformation of the fleet from MAXes, uh, to inaudible. 
So, really the, the provision for the, the front of aircraft, it's in that, and you can see that in the, 
uh, in the tables in the back of the release, and also in the footnote to the financial statement. There's about 176 million reals, 
which has to be provisioned because, you know, from an accounting perspective, because we are, uh, accelerating return of inaudible to the 
MAXes. And, um, we are no longer, uh, uh, constituting anymore maintenance reserves, uh, because we're utilizing deposits, inaudible or deposits, uh, to swap that out, as I mentioned in the previous question. 
So there is more or less a 100% offset between, uh, use of maintenance reserves, and, and what I just mentioned. 
Within that question, as well, there was, is what, what was the provision for legal p- proceedings in your cash flow. 
Uh, in the cash flow we have, uh, payment for, uh, legal proceedings, 
uh, in there of about 150 million reals related to, uh, contingencies on inaudible and inaudible, uh, taxes. 
Um, and then there is amount, amount as well in that legal proceedings line out on that you're looking at there, uh, from the person that asked the question, 
there are, uh, other credits that increased 192 million reals that compensate, 
almost compensate these values, uh, of these legal proceedings in the same amount. 
And then the final component of the question in that category, what was the, 
uh, what was the reason for the increase in other expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2021, 
which is basically, uh, 296 million reals versus 167 million reals. 
And that is a, the necessity we had to constitute an increased provision, uh, for contingencies, uh, on inaudible and inaudible taxes for the importation of aircraft. 
Uh, because one of our peers, uh, Azul, uh, lost, uh, a process in the amount of, inaudible mostly to the amount of, uh, 150 million reals. And so that forced us to change our perspective from, uh, a possible loss on that, uh, discussion, uh, if those taxes applied to the importation of aircraft to probable. 
And, you know, in the, in, uh, in the accounting policies process, when it goes to, uh, probable, you then have to constitute, uh, a provision. 
But that was based on, we have not yet lost the, uh, discussion with the government, but as one of the, our peers did lose the discussion, uh, that then, uh, creates the, the ne- need to increase the amount of, uh, provision on that. 
So hopefully that answers your questions on some of those, uh, details as you're looking at, uh, those items that are less focused on 
software. We can go back to the, um, to the, um, to the call list on the, uh, inaudible. And 
the next question will be from Savi Syth with Raymond James, please go ahead. 
Hey, good morning. This is, uh, inaudible for Savi here. 
Um, either Rich or Kaki. Um, if you could, regarding the, the 2022, uh, inaudible outlook, the 8% reduction versus 2019. 
Um, can you give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of capacity production and utilization there? Um, also is there, is there any change in, 
in the, um, NGV deliveries or, or anything we should consider there? 
Sorry, if you could re- you're, you're asking about, we didn't… could you repeat the question? Because I think you were asking about ' 22 crosstalk- 
2022, right? The inaudible. Okay, so I think it was more so maybe on the, 
you talked about a 8% reduction in, in caps from the fleet. Um, I wasn't sure if the, 
the slide, I believe it was 23, 
if that was- Okay. You're talking about crosstalk. an early outlook into 2022, 
or… crosstalk. Yeah, the, the, the, the MAX has a lower operating cost than the inaudible, and so as our aircraft portfolio increases, the amount of aircraft that are a 
MAX, um, that has a, uh, effect of reducing our duty cost. 
The main source of that is the, the lower fuel, uh, consumption. You know, we're getting the as advertised, 
you know, roughly, for us, it's about 16% less, uh, fuel consumption. 
And so I think that's what you're, you're asking about inaudible. 
Okay, certainly, that makes, that makes sense. I'm sorry, I thought, thought it was a maybe a early look into, 
to 2022, um, on the inaudible side. 
Is there anything that we should consider, though, in terms of how you, you plan to return to, uh, your fleet utilization? Or, or capacity early looking to 2020 what we should consider? 
Beyond the, the fleet crosstalk? Uh, 
if I understood the question… Yeah, if I understood the question, I mean, we'll be back, you know, in our ecosystem we'll be back to more normalized aircraft utilization numbers into Q1. 
Uh, you know, which for us is, you know, 
you know, you know, it should be a sweet spot for us. It's kind of 12 hours a day of utilization. You know, we expect to be, uh, back above 11 hours of utilization into Q1. Okay. 
Thanks, Rich. Um, and then if I could, on, on the revenue side, 
versus what you were thinking in j- in late July, last quarter when you provided guidance to now what's in the 4Q revenue outlook, 
what has changed? I know you talk at, uh, looking out in the 1Q, how, some corporate segments have come back faster, 
but that 4Q number has gone lower versus late July. So I was wondering what has changed since then. Yeah, sure. Yeah, 
I think, you know, we re- you know, revised down the revenue forecast for the Q4. 
Uh, it's mainly based on, 
uh, lower y- overall yields in the market. 
And, um, which has a big effect, uh, just given the, uh, still situation of, uh, low, uh, efficiency. 
And then also, and, and that's overall market, that's not just us. 
And then the, um, and we've been staying out of the way of that, um, scenario. And how we, how do we stay out of the way of that? 
We, know, we keep capacity, 
uh, 
lower. And so when you combine those effects, you know, it's staying out of the way of the low yield environment, given the overcapacity, 
uh, coming out of competitors, uh, and adjusting our offer down, or capacity down. You know, those two effects magnify 
into the reduced, uh, revenue. 
Uh, but the catalyst is obviously more on the yield side. 
You know, you know, we have the ability to flex up capacity, uh, fast if we need to, uh, given the amount of aircraft that we have. 
But, you know, we have had a management, uh, during this 20 months of the pandemic, 
uh, focused on two key metrics. One is, uh, preserving our unit cost advantage, 
uh, in the post-pandemic environment, and also matching our cash inflows with cash outflows. 
And so that limits, uh, what we can do. 
Uh, and you've seen how we've done that, uh, for those of you that have followed us, you've seen how we've done that through the pandemic, um, in terms of, uh, minimizing a- any operating, uh, cash burn. 
So, and how, and how, we do that through the capacity, uh, equation. If yields are better we can, we can inaudible. But, as Kaki mentioned, we're now in the process of reactivating 
our core, uh, network, uh, which is mainly focused on the business traveler. And, as- Hmm. as you saw in the slides as well, 
that shifts our focus from a network perspective from that massive hub we created in inaudible, we managed through the pandemic based on connecting flights, which was not that convenient, uh, for inaudible passengers to going back to, uh, a more point to point network, uh, with a very attractive, uh, point to point flights out of our 
other hubs, and also from our inaudible, uh, out of, uh, Sao Paolo, Rio, and Brazilian. 
That's happening as we speak. 
And so, at the goal, uh, in the goal, uh, 
ecosystem that, uh, it can have a significant impact on yields as, if, if we have some positive surprises on the corporates coming back. 
I think we'll see that more on the Q1, 
uh, because we're still in a transition on that. 
And we're still not back to normalized levels, 
uh, on market capacity, uh, as well as, uh, demand, uh, from the, the business traveler. 
And also the fact that you mentioned on the revenue side, obviously they, they have the effect on, uh, 
inaudible, uh, because it needs lower scale, and so less, less fixed cost inaudible. 
And so that's why our expectations for Q4 EBIT are down a bit. 
The other thing that is in there is, um, as I was mentioning, I think in the, in one of the previous questions, 
is an increase in, uh, CapEx. 
Uh, a- about a 200 million real increase in, in CapEx, into Q4. That, that mainly relates to investments 
in, uh, spare parts inventories. 
And other assets related to, uh, reactivation of the operating 
inaudible. And so, when you kinda, those are the factors, you know, one obviously on the yield, uh, capacity side, and them the other, like, CapEx side that 
account, uh, for about a, 
uh, a quarter million re- real reduction in our targeted liquidity, uh, for the end of Q4. But about half of that number is investment in assets. 
Like I said it also has, has a side benefit of increasing the, 
uh, collateral pool, uh, that's in our, uh, secured, uh, notes program. 
And those same effects will get you to the, uh, difference in the leverage. Uh, those exact same effects all kind of rolled into that. 
Um, 
and, um, and, you know, and, and, um, and so it's, uh, it's, um, it's a, it's a transitional, uh, quarter for us. 
Um, and, 
um… uh, there, there, there were, there were some s- uh, exchange rate effects in there, obviously. 
Uh, they kind of run through those calculations and put pressure on it, you know, on the, on the, on the net, net side of the equation also. 
Um, and those result in massive negative exchange rate effects, but those are not economic and don't affect the cash flow, just to highlight that. 'Cause we have gotten some questions on- 
Right. what it, what are exchange, uh, and monetary variations, 
you know, for those that aren't maybe familiar with, uh, investing in, um, developing countries with, uh, weak, uh, functional currencies. And our functional currency 
is real, uh, therefore, um, we have to recognize the exchange rate variation on the balance sheet, and that produces accounting effects in negative and positive, uh, you know, exchange, uh, in monetary, uh, variations. 
Which continue to be quite large, given the, uh, short term, uh, negative, uh, devaluation of the Brazilian real. 
And so, but that, for the most part, we recommend kind of backing that out, which what we, wh- which is what we try to do in our, 
in our, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, furnished, uh, disclosure. mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
Certainly. Well, thank, thank you very much, uh, for the color there, Rich. I really appreciate it, and your time. Okay. 
The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Hey, thanks. Good to speak with you. 
Um, on fleet, can you just maybe play back, uh, for us the, the fleet simplification opportunity here? 
I mean, it's not just MAX, and, and you've outlined those. Uh, you did a number of fleet transactions pre-Covid, uh, you know, short term leases to solve for a gap. 
Uh, then Covid hit. 
Ca, can you just help bring us up to speed on, on where we are with respect to those shorter term leases 
rolling off, and, and what the fleet simplification opportunity is here. 
Yes. Um, yeah, we still have a, a fair amount of, 
uh, inaudible on short term operating leases. Um, where we have, you know, the optionality of either extending those or returning them. 
The, uh, the nut there to crack is the availability of MAXes. 
Market right now is constrained 
in terms of the availability of MAXes, just given that Boeing is still, uh, only producing a, you know, below 20 MAXes a day. 
So it's still quite low, which is about a third of what they were producing pre- 
uh, pandemic. 
We have all the financing sources lined up to, uh, as, as many MAXes as we want to, uh, in the short term, and next year. 
Uh, you know, the bottleneck is the availability of, uh, new MAXes. 
Uh, there are still some white tails out there, but they have, you know, significant configuration costs and other issues that, um, make them less attractive 
now. So we have the ability to accelerate the, uh, returns of inaudible based on the structure of our 
aircraft portfolio, which is, which still to- today at 100% operating lease. 
Um, and I think another part of this implication that you're mentioning, 
or, that you're hinting at, is that what we'll do also, as we move into the acceleration of the transition from the inaudible to the MAX… 
inaudible to this, you know, the operating cost benefit based on the lower fuel consumption and, and higher, higher seat count on those aircraft and so on, 
is the component of, uh, how we're financing those acquisitions. And so we will also be 
doing more, uh, finance lease, uh, transactions as we move forward. 
Uh, you know, somewhere in the order of between four, and maybe as much as 16 of those next year, 
um, depending on the availability of MAXes. And there's a significant equity value creation that, that comes with that, 
as you saw y- on the previous cycle when we did 40, uh, inaudible on first order with Boeing, 
and we've created an excess of $500 million in cash equity, uh, gains, uh, through that process. And it also gives us equity to borrow against the things like that. 
So the, I guess the other component I would say, Duane, of that is 
our ability to 
get back in the, uh, in the game of, um, uh, owning a, a, a portion of our fleet. 
Uh, you know, uh, t- the reason why we're 100% operating lease today is, you know, pre-pandemic, we had, uh, uh, finalized the inaudible of our inaudible portfolio, 
and we were in the midst of, you know, still in the midst of the MAX, the MAX, uh, grounding. 
And so we, i- in that, and then the pandemic happened, all that's kinda got pushed out. So we have enormous flexibility to return, 
uh, inaudible at a faster pace. 
Um… Achieved at a faster pace. Um, and the bottleneck uses the availability of MAXes to do it. Operationally, you know, we're scaled up. You know, our- our operational capacity, 
you know, on a normalized basis is easily, you know, two aircraft receipts and two re-deliveries per month. 
You know, two in, two out, four total. We can go as high as three per month, 
um, given our operational, uh, 
capability. And so for us it's operational eas- easily, uh, done operationally to, you know, bring in 24 MAXes and- 
and- and transition out 24 NTs make sure if we need to do. 
So, uh, our- our- our flew fund is a little bit less than that 
and part of it's because we're still in the sourcing of the right MAXes, uh, for that activity. But, I think it's important to mention that none of that is gonna consume, uh, our liquidity because 
we already have the financing, uh, sources lined up to, uh, pay for those, uh, MAX acquisitions that are in our plan, plus some additional in case we need it. 
We already have the issue of the liability is lined up and we're still working on, uh, additional sourcing of aircraft. 
Hopefully that- that answers your question. 
Yeah, listen, it- it does. The, um, the delivery rate, you know, came up on the Ryanair call as well. 
Um, so I- I guess the question would be for the, for the deliveries that you've outlined, you know, for the rest of this year and into ' 
22, how- how many of those are- are already built? 
Um, and, you know, how does that forecast feel relative to kind of the delivery rate that you're, um, that you're seeing? 
Well, in terms of what's coming out of the factory, um, we would need, you know, somewhere between eight to 
10 aircraft, if it, if the source is the factory. If the source is the white tail market, we've got that covered. 
And, that's- that's what we're working on as we speak. 
Uh, because… And the issue with the white tail market is we have some additional reconfiguration costs that we wouldn't have if it was coming out of the factory, uh, for us. 
But, um, but, um, maybe you can help us convince Boeing to ramp up production to sell more aircraft. Um- <laugh> 
I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be your-… Okay. guy, I wouldn't be your guy for that. But, um, just I'll speak one more in here Rich, um, because I'm always interested in your thoughts here. 
You know, what- what FX rate kinda drives the- the long term 
plan and, you know, for what it's worth, you know, ho- how do we get there? How do you see the path, um, to- to- to that long term rate? Thank you. 
Well, um, we're not in charge of that. But, 
um, the, you know, most, uh, bank market forecasts are for an appreciating rial, 
you know, something with a fore handle on it, uh, at some point next year. If you take fair value calculations, 
our fair value calculations are below four. 
Um, you know, we're now 12 months inside of, um, presidential elections in Brazil. 
Um, and so that, uh, that is, uh, gonna be a factor that will maintain volatility high. 
Um, you know, we addressed in our presentation, in the videos on the website this morning and also in our release, I mean, the- the Brazil fiscal situation 
is much better and improving. It's much better than the US, uh, fiscal situation, for example. 
And, you know, TDP in Q3 was up, uh, 
four percent. Uh, it's around three percent for the, for the Q4, uh, which is down a little bit. 
Um, but I- I- I think, you know, my own personal opinion would be you're gonna see weakness in the currency, 
uh, because of the political dynamic, uh, between now and October of next year. 
Um, but, um- um, you know, I'm going back to that ease point, that is gonna keep a relatively captive audience for us for domestic air travel, 
uh, which is perhaps the silver lining on that. 
Uh, which is why we're not, um, focused today on driving international travel, 
uh, just given the little purchasing, uh, power of, uh, Brazilians in- in red eyes. 
And I'd have to point you to market projections on that because inaudible it does seem to be a disconnect between the fundamentals of Brazil and the currency which are related to other factors. 
High oil prices are a, are a, are a bull, uh, factor, uh, for Brazil. 
Uh, you know, the raw materials, uh, sector of Brazil, the extraction economy, which primarily drives the Brazilian economy has been doing very well during this pandemic. 
Um, and that will create a positive effect in, you know, in- in what other people were asking about in terms of the, uh, elasticity of the return of corporate travel, 
um, in terms of those sectors being, uh, consumers of air travel. So on the volume side, I think the exchange rate is less of an issue. 
Um, but obviously does effect, uh, cash flow because it pressures 
both the oil price that we have to pay which now a million dollars, as well as the, uh- uh, the aircraft, uh, costs, uh, which is not ideal. 
Uh, but it doesn't look like we're gonna be getting any, let's say market relief, on that any time soon. Um, and, uh, just given the volatility 
and, you know, the- the relative perception of the ex- you know, the outside world on- on Brazil. 
And that- that's my two sense on that, but we're not the boss of that. Uh, you know, we're- we're price takers on that. 
Very fair. Thank you. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. 
The next question is from Alejandro Zemicona with Credits Lease. Please go ahead. 
Thank you. Hi, Paolo. Hi, Richard, thank you for taking my questions. Um, 
I'm just, uh, curious on what's your view on the potential recovery, eh, of the international market c- to pre- COVID levels? 
And the, what would be the impact, uh, on geo inaudible, uh, international market, uh, 
reactivation? Hi, 
Alejandro. Actually, we are not that bullish. Uh, the international markets, uh, recover for 2022. 
There is two, uh, different, uh, regulations and different sanitary, uh, 
requirements, uh, which make us doubt whether 
it's gonna be possible to harmonize all of them, uh, in the first half of the year. 
So, this is one thing. 
The second is, also, that, uh- uh, the- the potential overcapacity with be deployed because you can imagine, 
the total amount of wide-bodies, uh, available in the world, 
those has not been. So, those have not been, uh, used widely for- for, I mean, many months. And- 
And also, clearly, 
if there's gonna be, when a specific segment 
been, uh, severely effected, 
uh, by the- the so-called, uh, new normal behavior, it's gonna be the long haul business trips. Uh, 
I think that 
this customer will really, 
uh, think twice beca- before deciding to take a plane 
for a short, uh- uh, business trip, mainly long haul. 
So, uh, honestly, I think that 
inaudible, the international markets will be, uh- 
uh- uh, effected, uh- uh, they are already effected and that effect will- will last longer than- than expect. 
So, 
uh, but on the other hand, I believe that the, uh, long haul leisure travelers 
will be there and- and- and mainly for the most important tourist destinations. 
So, but, you know, inaudible, uh, was the- the- the business traveler 
pre-pandemic for those airlines operating wide-bodies, business classes, businesses and- and- and first classes. Uh, 
I am not that- that bullish, 
uh- uh, about this- this specific market demand. 
Okay, thank you. And then, uh, a second question if I may, uh, on the maintenance. Uh, we- we saw a significant increase during this quarter in maintenance expense. 
So, we were wondering, uh, what was inaudible this increase and, uh, what can we expect going forward? Um, I- 
I assume that it's a- a- a catch-up from the deferred maintenance. Uh, but I- I'm just, uh, curious on hear your thoughts. Uh, thank you guys. Yeah, sure, Alejandro. 
I guess you didn't hear the answer to the previous question, but I'll- I'll go through that again. 
Um, the, you're asking about the increase in maintenance expenses from the Q2 to the Q3 from 88 million inaudible to 246 million 
inaudible. Um, that is from… 
And maybe- maybe, I'll- I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll answer it from a different, uh, perspective. 
That is related to the acceleration of the transition of the fleet from NTs to MAXes 
where we are accelerating the returns of aircraft. 
Now, over the next couple months, over the next year, 
and what you have to do on a quarterly basis is always be fully provisioned on your future redelivery estimates. 
And so, as we're accelerating now, the, 
um, the return of the IDs, you have, we have to top off, we have to increase the amount of provisions, uh, for maintenance on aircraft. 
And so, in that particular case, 
the- the- the- there was a certain number of aircraft, 
um, in the sin- you know, in the mid-single digits where, um, the, those provisions increased. 
That, so it's in there, always remember that. That's- That's, you- you always have to be estimating… If you're doing your accounting properly, 
you should always ask that question to make sure the companies are provisioning properly their future, uh, redelivery costs. 
You have to always be adjusting your, 
uh, provision for that. And for us, you know, the main component of those de- delivery costs is engine overhauls. 
And so, in our particular case, uh, as we increased the number of NTs that were returning 
and, you know, the number of MAXes that we're bringing in, uh, those provisions in the Q3 increase from 88 million inaudible to 246 million inaudible. 
Okay. 
Um, what I'm gonna do- Okay. Thank you. for… Yeah, sure, no- no worries. 
Um, we have, um, one more person in the queue, 
uh- uh, to ask a question. But before that I'm gonna take another question that we have from the, uh, 
platform, uh, which is asking about yields, RASK, and task, 
um, in 
Q2, Q3, Q4. And so, I'll just walk through that. 
Um, you know, we had a, you know, you know, 15 percent increase in yields in the Q3. 
And, you know, what's implicit in our Q4 guidance is, basically, flat yields versus the Q3. 
You know, we're being conservative on that 
given the, um, capacity, um, environment. 
Um, given that we are forecasting <unk> goes up a little bit, 
that will, in- in the Q4, uh- uh, is implied, 
um, a slight increase in RASK over where we were in the Q3. 
You know, we did the 26 cents in the Q3. 
We think we could be around something around 28 cents in the Q4. 
And on the cost side of the equation, 
um, you know, the recurring unit costs that we did in the, 
uh, in the Q3 of, uh, just under 22 cents in rial, 
uh, in those Q4 guidance numbers that we provided, 
um, is a similar level. 
Uh, even though we are, as I was mentioning, increasing the operating fleet and the Ludi six costs. As 
we return NTs and accelerate transition from the MAXes, 
uh, we have a combination of, you 
know, higher, um, expenses for maintenance for the re-deliveries, higher provisions, and also higher, um, higher depreciation. 
Um, 
and so that- that goes to, just looking down here, that basically addresses that, uh, 
question, uh, which is basically a conservative forecast for the Q4, uh, guidance we're providing. 
It's mainly volume driven. It's not being driven out of an increase in yields or a reduction in unit costs. 
As inaudible was mentioning, you know, if- if we get a higher ela- positive elasticity on the business side, that's gonna have a positive impact on yields, 
and, you know, um, could, uh, translate into, uh, better revenue numbers for the Q4. 
So with that, Operator, we can go back to the last question 
in the queue. Okay. I- I got a lot inaudible. Operator, you can go to the last question in the queue. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. 
This will be the last opportunity for questions for <unk>. The next question is from Matthew Breckenridge from DSC Meridian. Please go ahead. 
Hi, uh, my question has actually been answered. Thank you very much. Okay, Matt. Thanks. 
This concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to invite Mr. Kackenhoff to proceed with his closing remarks. Please go ahead sir. 
I just would like to thank you all very much for the attention. Uh, have a nice day. This concludes the Gol Airlines conference call for today. 
Thank you very much for your participation and have a nice day.
