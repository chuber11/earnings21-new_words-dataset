Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Merlin Properties nine months 2021 results call. 
At this time all participants are in listen only mode, until we'll conduct a question and answer session. And instructions will be given at that time. 
Just to remind you all this conference call is being recorded. Um, I like to hand over to Ines Arellano, please bega- begin, I'll be standing by. 
Thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome, and thank you for joining Merlin's nine months 2021 trading update. 
We remind you that we will not be suing additional materials in today's call, uh, other than the executive summary that we published last night. 
Our CEO, Ismael Clemente will walk you through the main highlights, and then we will open the lines for Q&A. 
Miguel Ollero, our COO is also here with us for any questions that you may have. With no further delay, I pass the floor to Ismael. Thank you. 
Thank you, Ines. Uh, good afternoon everyone. 
Uh, uh, operationally, uh, the, the quarter has been a relatively short one, uh, given others, 
but the outcome, uh, has been very positive, overall. 
And, uh, we also have good visibility on the fourth quarter, and, uh, year 2022. 
The top line of the company is clearly improving, uh, following COVID, 
uh, of course we have a dragging effect of the first half 
that will only flatten a little bit towards the year end. 
But in this quarter, we are printing a negative like for like rental growth of minus 1.2, recovering one point from the situation in, 
uh, in, uh, June. 
Our revenue figures are not yet capturing, uh, the inflation that we see, uh, which in Spain is significant, also elsewhere in Europe. 
Uh, we might be entering a period in which, for the first time in many years, we, we could have 
positive print in both, uh, indexation, occupancy growth, 
and release spread, uh, in the coming months. 
Uh, we have continued providing some rent reliefs, uh, linked to COVID, 
uh, that total now 23.7 million, with four million, uh, recorded in the quarter 
Again, as always, uh, uh, not straight line, 
but simply recorded as a one off expense. Uh, this is mainly, uh, given the fact that 
Barcelona is taking longer than expected to recover, owing to the absence of tourism. Uh, 
Lisbon has been very slow in lifting the lockdown, 
I mean, we have had restrictive measures in shopping centers till well advanced 
October, and we also have some lines of businesses, like for example, cinemas, which continue heavily effected by the tail end of the pandemic fears. 
So, of course, we have continued protecting those clients, 
but, uh, well, the, uh, absolute figures as you can see, are significantly, uh, diminishing as compared 
to what we experienced, uh, last year. 
Collection rates, uh, are fantastic. 
Uh, and when we see, when we say non eventful levels, that means 2.3% in shopping centers, which comes significantly down from 
past figures, uh, given that the level of zombification now is minimal. 
We have been very, very successful in replacing zombies by new healthy tenants, 
and we have done it in a more than one to one, uh, ratio, because occupancy 
is, is 
growing, uh, in offices and logistics, when we say non eventful, means close to zero. 
So, uh, in terms of FFO per share, the inaudible in the month has been slightly above 15 cents, 
uh, which together with the 13 cents we produced in the first quarter, and the 14 produced in the second, 
total 0.43, uh, as of September, uh, this year, 
which is up 2.3% increase compared to the first nine months of 2000 
and, and 20. Uh, when comparing, apples to apples, you should always take into account that, uh, the figures in 
2020 didn't include, uh, the staff compensation in full. 
So, we are, uh, starting to remunerate back 
at least, uh, at the short term incentives, 
uh, level, the middle management of the company, we can not keep the same extraordinary measures we applied last year, where everybody was simply receiving fixed salary. 
I mean, this year people is doing an extraordinary job, and, and, you know, and at least at the middle management level, they deserve some recognition by the company. 
So, in the absence of that, we're comparing apples to apples, 
it will have been 
0.45 comparing nine months 2020. 
Um, we are well on track to surpass the guidance for 2021, which, uh, we maintain at 0.66 per share. Uh, 
I know there has been some debate regarding this, 
uh, it will be simply very easy for us to, uh, to update this, uh, guidance. 
The only reason why we don't do it is because while, 
by signing contracts we have a very good visibility, and can easily forecast, uh, occupancy levels in the three business areas in which the company operates. 
In terms of cashflow, we 
don't whether, you know, a new strain of the bug coming from the Far East, 
or that gives us a very bad Christmas campaign, or the bankruptcy of a tenant, you know, may eventually, 
you know, damage us, in, on, on the, on the, uh, cashflow generation capacity. 
In the absence of any extraordinary, uh, 
effect, it is clear to any, you 
know, uh, uh, observer that, you know, the, the, the final print of cashflow, uh, for the year, should be more in the region of 0.58. 
Uh, so, you know, if, if that serves as a new guidance, uh, happy to provide it. No problem. 
Um, we haven't conducted any reevaluation in the period, 
so the NPA per share stands at 15.69, which is, uh, one and half percent, uh, year to day, year to day, uh, 
above, uh, previous figure. 
Um, in terms of, uh, business performance, in offices, 
it's been, uh, relatively busy, uh, 
period, with more than 200000 square meters contracted. 
Uh, we have, uh, negative like for like of 2.1, mainly, as commented, given the dragging effect of a bad first half. 
Uh, but the release spread is, uh, continues to be quite healthy at 4.8%. Uh, this is, uh, mainly a consequence of the, um, delta between our passing rents and, and market as you, uh, 
all know, because we are just getting out of the woods in terms of, uh, weakness of the demand. 
I mean, uh, as, as commented in a number of occasions, 
given the COVID period, 
the problem in, at least in the Spanish market, has not been a problem of oversupply, has not been a problem out, of in- of indebtedness and distress, of the office players. 
It's been mainly a under demand, 
which by the way, seems to be correcting as we speak, because we, we have had a very busy third quarter, 
we are having a very busy fourth quarter, 
and the agents, the market agents are telling us that 2022 is going to be year of, uh, very high activity in the office market. 
I mean, using Madrid as a proxy, 
if the average take up in the city, gross 
take up, because you know, for net take up, we need to recover the pre- COVID, uh, employment figures, but, uh, for, for gross take 
up, if in a normal year, we do 450000, uh, square meters, 
next year, people is, uh, forecasting between 600 and 700000 square meters, so it's going to be a, a year of very significant activity. 
And we hope to be, 
um, you know, profiting from that activity in order to continue filling up our, our portfolio. 
Um, 
the uh, final occupancy of the quarter has been 89.4, 30 inaudible above, uh, 
previews, and the visibility towards year end points, uh, to around 90%, uh, occupancy. 
Uh, in order to go back to 91, uh, that we posted in 2020, we need to wait to see what happens in 2021, 
in tw- in 22 sorry, but it is clearly our goal to go back in 22, to the 2020, uh, figures 
at least. Um, in, uh, in, uh, logistics, uh, we have contracted m- again more than 200000 square meters, with a like for 
like of only 0.6%, but this is owing to the occupancy drop that we had in the first half, and we cleaned up 
a number of temporary contracts we had, and one bankruptcy that has, uh, happened in, in, in the portfolio. 
Otherwise, the release spread has been 3.2%, occupancy stands at 96.5%, uh, trending to around 97 towards year 
end. So, that is technically, uh, full occupancy, because there is always, uh, tenants that are moving in and out of the portfolio. 
In shopping centers, uh, I am very pleased to see what has happened in the quarter, 
which no- provides also some, 
um, insight, and, and, and, and gives value to the decisions that we took during the pandemic. 
Um, yes, the like for like has been minus 0.6%, 
uh, but the release spread has been 5.9, people is accepting these step 
ups, uh, without significant problem. 
And, 
uh, the, um, you know, uh, the inaudible you know, inaudible with, um, with the, uh, retailers is positive. 
I mean, the occupancy cover ratio, the OCR, uh, is very healthy, at 12.4%, 
I eman, which, you know, quite comfortable compared to what we have seen, uh, other people reporting across Europe. 
So, people is happy, and as commented previously, is paying. 
So we, we are not having problems of collection in shopping centers, and there is peace, 
uh, with all retailers, also on the legal front, because, as you know, we had very little litigation arising out of the COVID, of the COVID period. 
And the replacement of zombies that we have commented so many times, with many of you know very worried about what is the level of cov- of, uh, zombification, and us providing you with figures, wa- with an analysis of the red flag, the yellow flags, the green flags, and all that, 
thank god, it's, it's becoming a thing of the past. Uh, of course, uh, like in normal retail activity, we continue having concepts that do not fly, 
and as they do not fly, they need to close, 
but, uh, you know, we are replacing those concepts, 
uh, with, uh, relative ease, uh, and the shopping centers remain very well, uh, 
occupied, uh, and, and functioning, uh, you know, m- I would say very close to normal run rate. 
Yes, when you compare, um, 
September to September, you are minus 15%, uh, and minus, uh, 9% in sales, 
but you need to take into account that in September, we still had, uh, restrictions in Catalonia, and particularly in Lisbon. 
So, when we look at these figures in the new quarter, in the fourth, 
they are going to be more on the, uh, mid single digit, uh, area. 
So, very, very interesting to see 
the, you know, it's the encouraging recovery of the physical commerce, despite all what we have been talking 
for, you know, long, uh, um, time in, in this type, in these calls. Um, every quarter 
occupancy has recovered to 93.8%, it will trend to around 94% by the end of the year. 
Uh, it is very, very difficult to go significantly up from this figure, because as you know, we have one shopping center in the portfolio, 
which is, uh, has a relatively low occupancy, uh, and drags the whole average down. 
I mean, in the absence of that shopping center, 
uh, we should be above 96 and a half, 97, so very close to, to full occupancy. And we have number of shopping center already in the portfolio, 
which have waiting lists in terms of, uh, of tenants. 
Um, very importantly, uh, in offices, there has been a silent effort to renew a number of big names, a number of big clients, 
uh, this, uh, effort has resulted, of course, in, 
has taken a toll in, in terms of, uh, release spread, because we have, uh, in some cases, we have, um, you know, uh, given up a little bit in rent, but what is clear is that the office world of the company 
has now been extended from 3.4, 
uh, you know, years in the six months, uh, first six months of 2021, 
to around 3.7 in the, in, in a- at present, in nine months. 
And m- although this might look like, uh, like minimal, uh, when translated into office rent backlog, that is a lot of money. 
So, we have moved from around 700 million backlog, uh, as of six months, 
to more than 900 as of, uh, nine months. 
So, the, the effort that the office team, and the office leasing team has been doing during the year in very difficult circum- 
circumstances needs to be praised. 
Um, uh, well in t-… changed. Um, uh, well, in terms of how the, the, the quarter has evolved, 
uh, we proposed to the board of directors to start normalizing back a little bit the, the dividend policy of, of, of the company. 
Uh, the board has decided that, uh, 15 cents, uh, will be distributed, uh, against, uh, financial year, 2021 with immediate effects. 
I mean, that is a payment to be expected around beginning of December, 
and the rest of the dividend, uh, will be paid after the shareholders meeting next year. I mean, when, when, when the final amount of dividend is approved. 
We are guiding to around 40 cents of, of dividend in total, 
which for us, we as shareholders of the company, is a good outcome because, uh, we have guided to two years of flat 30 cents, 
but this year we do not see any longer, uh, significant pressure on valuations. 
So we are not too much afraid in terms of LTV. 
And as a consequence, given that we are generating back a lot of cashflow, it is fair that we share that cashflow with our, with our shareholders. 
Uh, also, you know, that we operate under the Spanish SOCIMI regime, the Red regime. 
So, uh, for those of you who are complaining that you don't want to receive dividend, you want us to reinvest everything in highly accreditive activities of the company, which is something we will love, 
but you need to know that, uh, it is also good and healthy 
that are rate distributes dividend. 
So we, we are going back to, uh, dividend distribution. Um, 
I know one of the questions that you will, uh, make is on non-core, uh, divestments. 
As you know, um, we were, uh, relatively early in the year, we dispose of around 50% of our objectives for the year, 
we guided to, uh, between 150 and 200 million of non-core disposals. 
Uh, we have already affected around 109, 
uh, but there is more to come between now and year-end, and 
we expect to be in the upper end of the range of probably above the range in terms of total amount of, uh, 
disposals, moment in which we will move into more important disposals, uh, next year. 
Um, that is basically, uh, on my side. Um, we are open to Q&A. I'm happy to entertain your, your questions. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Operator, can you please open the line for our Q&A? Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, if you wish to register for questions, 
you can press star one on your telephone key pad. Once again, that's start star one your telephone key pad to register for questions. And the hash or pound key to cancel. 
Once again, that's start one to register for questions and the hash and pound key to cancel. 
Our first question comes from the line of Fernando Avrid from Alantra. Please go ahead with your question. 
Hello. Um, thank you very much for the presentation. I have three questions if I may. 
Um, first is on, um, occupancy in, in, in offices. So I don't know… So you've, you improved, uh, your outlook for the year. 
I would like to know the drivers, uh, behind this. I don't know if existing clients, uh, wanted to increase their 
lease space or new clients or any specific market that is outperforming, um, 
I don't know, and the drivers, uh, would, would be very helpful. 
And also linked to this, um, just to clarify, so you, you are, uh, forecasting occupancy to grow in ' 22, uh, from 90% levels? 
Um, so that is the first question. 
Then the second question is on, on retail. I don't know if you have any update on, on how, um, rent renegotiations are going. 
Uh, you provided, uh, some detailing in, in the previous quarter, I don't know if, is there anything new? 
Um, and then last question is, 
um, with regards to inflation. 
So I don't know if you can comment a bit on this topic, both on the top-line and, and cost side. No, I don't know if you have, uh, rental caps or not. 
Um, and also, I don't know if utilities, uh, you normally tend to recharge those costs, uh, to, to clients or, or not. 
Um, and I don't know if you have any forecast 
of, uh, at, at an OAI level, uh, for the next year considering current inflation. Thank you. 
Okay, Fernando, um, well, regarding office occupancy, 
the main drivers, uh, that we see is basically increases of, uh, of space by, by existing clients 
and a number of, uh, you know, new fill-ups that we have done, uh, during the quarter. 
Um, notably, uh, and it will be more visible next year, 
we see, uh, some increased activity in the, uh, so much demeaned A1 corridor. 
Why is that? Is this a mystery? 
No, I believe there is people who is already 
acting in advance of the major infrastructure works which are being carried as we speak, by the Municipality of Madrid. 
So, uh, the, the A1 corridor is clearly, uh, improving. I mean, just in, in this year, 
we have been able to sign close to 4,000, 4- 14,000 square in the A1 corridor. 
So, uh, you know, it's, um, it's quite encouraging because, uh, this is an area which has caused us many headaches in the past. 
Uh, we have always bet on that area because we thought, uh, the future of Madrid was revolving around that area when the foreign language 
Martin was carried out. 
The future of the foreign language Martin is closer and closer in the horizon. 
Uh, the municipality has started to re-infrastructure the area, 
and this is provoking much more tenant interest in the area because, 
you know, uh, it is evident to any external observer that is the area in which there is more office conce- 
concentration around Madrid. And office concentration is an attractive point in itself because it provides the possibility of meeting other people 
that works in other offices. So, you know, it's, you know, being completely, uh, dispersed in the city is not necessarily what, what tenants, uh, like. 
Uh, in terms of, of, uh, retail, uh, well, the m- the, uh, rents that we are renewing, uh, forward 2022 to 2025, 
uh, 
we commented and the situation remains the same that the gross-to-net had worsened. 
I mean, we, we used to have a gross-to-net of 4%, uh, you 
know, that's, that has seen a relatively stable historical average. 
And, uh, as of today, the contract that we are signing forward ' 
22, are starting with, uh, already with some incentives that have taken, uh, those contracts to a gross-to-net leakage of around 14%. 
So this is why we were commending on a number of locations that 
we see a real rent reduction in the region of 10% as we speak, but in the form, not of lower nominal rent, in the form of bonus, 
which as, you know, if you are familiar with shopping centers, those can be withdrawn over time. 
So we like what we see, 
because remember in many occasions, when we have been discussing about what would be the effect of, uh, 
eCommerce on the physical retail, 
we have in many, in many, uh, occasions, uh, talked about, 
um, uh, mi- future or new, new, uh, new normal in the future of around minus 20%. 
Uh, it, it looks, at least for now it looks that this new normal is more in the region of minus 10 
and in the form of bold modifications of rent, 
which, you know, may point toward a lower number as the tenant sales stabilize. And they are stabilizing. 
I mean, we are seeing a number of our shopping centers 
fa- fall in this quarter, but more to come in the next quarter, which are already selling more than in 2019, which is extremely positive. 
It looks, it looks like the, 
um, lion share of the effect of the biggest, bigger, um, eCommerce penetration, uh, is being taken, uh, by, uh, high street retail. 
So shopping centers, particularly good old-run shopping centers or good dominant shopping centers are defending themselves, 
uh, reasonably better than we, uh, all expected from the threat of, um, online, online commerce. 
Um, regarding inflation, uh, top-line versus cost. 
Uh, look, in a company like this, uh, 
I don't want to, uh, be too positive, 
uh, because of course inflation is not a nice thing in itself, but in a company like this, um, inflation has a big effect, 
uh, because on the top-line, one thing I can tell you is that 100% of the rents of the company are, uh, indexed to inflation. 
Uh, many people these days 
is now starting to ask, What is the, um, elasticity of, uh, of the tenant to accept, um, inflation hikes? 
This is same people that thought we will only collect 50% of our rents, 
and the same people who probably thought, uh, that work-from-home would be 50%, and the retailer armageddon 
will hit hard. Um, I mean, the reality is that, uh, it is much more dangerous to get inflation in your top-line when 
you are operating in a city where rents are already significantly inflated. 
So in Madrid, as compared to base 100, 2007, 
we are currently at 75 / 80 taking prime as a proxy of the average of the market. 
So being at 75 / 80, most of the effect of inflation will be a catch-up effect, 
compared to the previous peak. 
In the cities where rents are already 130% of the previous peak, 
I worry more about inflation because that will create a very significant effect in the, uh, in the rental levels. 
But, uh, we think it's going to be, uh, 
at, at least we are going to enjoy. For the first time in many years, we are going to enjoy a positive effect from indexation in the coming months. 
We have been always, uh, obtaining real growth in rent, 
uh, with positive release spread, but almost, uh, for the last two, three years, we have always posted negative inflation prints. 
So for the first time, we are going to start, let's say, enjoying, if I can use the word, um, inflation. 
Well, in the case of, uh, the BBVA contract, which is also the subject of many questions by analysts, 
uh, well, you have seen the inflation print of the advanced indicator provided by Eurostat of the HICP, um, of October, 
which is 4.1%. 
I mean, unless this figure is, uh, changed when they released the, the final, uh, data on the 17th of November, 
uh, that will mean an adjustment in rent 
to BBVA, uh, in the region of 6.1%, 6.15%, which is moving from 79 million to around 84 million, uh, which is 1 cent of extra, uh, cashflow for, for the company, 
uh, next, uh, next year. 
In terms of how this is affecting our costs. 
Yes, there is, there is being a big problem with utilities, but, uh, as you know, uh, utilities are 100% rechargeable to tenants. 
So in reality, the net effect you suffer is only the effect of your vacancy. 
So the, 
of course, the utilities applied to your vacant space, 
you have to swallow that, uh, effect. But this is minimal as compared to the fact that, you know, for the rest of your space and remember, the portfolio overall, 
overall, uh, because you always tend to, uh, focus only in offices, but the portfolio overall is occupied at 94%. 
So we tend to recharge, uh, the extra, um, energy cost to, to clients. 
There is also inflation in CapEx, but, and this is just by chance. I mean, it's not that we saw that inflation coming, 
but we are lucky because most of the CapEx, uh, we have to do is already behind us. 
I mean, we have finished with the very expensive flagship program. We have finished CapEx in all of our incentive. 
We have finished, finished with most of our office building, uh, refurbishment. There is only one which is, uh, being done at, at present. 
And yes, in, uh, 
in, uh, logistics, we were a little bit scared because we saw hiking price in steel, but since, uh, the peak, they have significantly receded 
and now, you know, the cost of construction in logistics is back to more normal levels. 
So, um, you know, it is not very highly intensive in, in man hours. 
So, you know, if, if, if there is salary inflation, there will not be so much translation 
into the, um, logistic construction cost. 
So we are, in principle, uh, okay, uh, in terms of, of inflation. The top-line of the company will clearly 
grow, and we will create a very significant cushion as compared to our debt service, 
because our debt service, as you know, is flat. 
I mean, we have it hedged for the next, uh, six years. 
Uh, and, you know, we will create a very significant buildup in the top… Uh and, you know, we will create a very significant build up in the top line that will help us overcome whatever happens with rent, six years down the road. 
So, you know, um, not, not so bad, 
of course, you need to take in to account that at the end rent tend to be linked to productivity. 
So when there is a high inflation period, normally there are some rental adjustment following that inflationary period. But we, we have managed those situations in the past. 
I mean, we, we know that all in all net, net, net, you normally end up being winner in those situations and there is abundant, 
uh, well particularly, very good, uh, research in this regard. I was recently reading, um, Morgan Stanley inaudible, 
providing some clarity on the behavior of companies in the last, uh, 50 years with very interesting, uh, data collection of the last 50 years 
and, you know. Uh, yet you have a problem at the beginning 
but normally people, uh, gets, uh, cast on to the new, to a new situation. 
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure. 
Ladies and gentlemen, once again to register for questions is the inaudible and the number one to register for questions. So star one to register for questions. 
Hmm, we have a new question and it comes in line of Pot Kastens from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Hi Ismael, it's Pot from Morgan Stanley. 
Um, thank you for, um, the presentation. 
I just wanted to follow up on your comments, uh, on the bank branches. You highlighted how, um, you'll be able to increase the rent probably by more than 6% in January. 
Um, this must be the most opportune time, um, that we've seen for a long time to sell these assets. 
And if they are indeed not very core to your portfolio and you haven't really spoken much about it in the release. 
They are not very core to you as you've highlighted in the past. Um, you've mentioned before that you've had received some interest from potential buyers. 
Um, what is your, what is Merlin strategy around those assets for the next six to 12 months? Thank you. 
Okay, Mark. Um, uh, we have been receiving now sufficient and very credible interest on the portfolio. 
So, uh, yes, we are, we are going to get serious. I mean, we are finishing a number of disposals between now and year end. 
Uh, there is some work to do 
in order to make sure we, uh, achieve the disposal, total disposal goal of, uh, 2021. 
And following that we are going to move into, uh, full focus, 
uh, regarding this portfolio. As you know, that portfolio, uh, vocationally, uh, because it's bank branches is not 
100% call to us. 
Uh, we have received, um, significant interest and very serious on, on, on this portfolio. 
And we now have enough data points to know more or less where the pricing could be. 
We have been working also on a number of, um, things that might, you know, be, uh, too much of a detail. But in 
reality, one thing we discovered is that the people who is very good at discounting cash flows, 
very, very, I would say competitive at discounting cash flows, normally has no clue or what to do with the real estate at the end, and vice versa. The people who does want the real estate because they think the real estate is great, 
normally it's not very competitive in terms of, um, discounting cash flows. 
So now, uh, we have, uh, besides, let's say the normal way of execution, which is fire and forget. Which is sell the whole thing, and, uh, go fishing. 
Uh, we have also, uh, created a structure which allows a certain decoupling of both situations. 
So, deep… 
The entity that buys cash flows from the entity that launched the real estate, so they can team up in one single buyer 
and buy from us, with each party taking what they need. 
Um, so with that now, hmm… Fully developed and tested, 
uh, tested with tax authorities, tested with the auditor and text, tested, uh, with the market, 
we are going to move into execution mode. 
I won't, um, nail down myself by providing any date of execution and or figures. 
Uh, because we have painfully learned in the past that this creates a lot of tension 
and in all calls people is discussing whether we should be getting this or this, plus 3% or this minus 5%. 
And, you know, we don't want to, uh, entertain, uh, such discussions. Uh, it is a very important sale for the company. 
On the positive and on the negative side, because we are saying, we will be saying goodbye to a very significant source of stable income. 
But on the other side it is a fantastic opportunity to deleverage the company to the level absolutely unseen by us in the past, 
and more in line with our, uh, UK peers. 
Uh, which I believe makes sense in the current, uh, environment because it will also provide the company with the freedom and the flexibility to execute on any project it might need to execute in the future. 
Uh, most notably we will have enough muscle to develop all of our data center, uh, program. 
Which is a lot of money that have very hefty returns 
and, you know, it will provide us with a possibility to continue developing our Greenfield Logistics program till the end, till we run out of, of, um, land bank for suitable for logistics. 
So now we are, uh, now seriously considering this. 
We should be expected to move into execution at some point. UH, 
I will not provide any date or target figures because it will be simply suicidal on my, on my side. 
So that, you know, I know that this is, uh, very important for you. I, I, 
I know your, uh, your stance regarding this 
and I know your critics about the glacial pace at which we, uh, take decisions. 
But, uh, be assured that the only reason why we take decisions at glacial pace it's because we want to ensure the best execution possible. 
We cannot run this company, you know. Now left, then right, then center, then forward. 
I mean we, we, we need to make sure that we obtain the best possible execution from this asset, uh, which is a very, very important asset for, for the company. 
That's very clear. Thank you very much. You're welcome 
Mark. Uh, next question, council line of Clark inaudible from Clarence Capital. Please go ahead with your question. 
Hi there, good afternoon. Um, I've, I also had a question on BBVA. So, uh, it's already been answered very clearly. 
Um, perhaps just leading on from that, you mentioned, uh, leverage, uh, or potential to deleverage the, the business. 
So I'm just wondering if, uh, if what your aspirational leverage level would look like? 
Um, and if that would also, in your mind, feed into, uh, into the credit ratings? 
Uh, and the last point, last question I have is, uh, in early 2022, you have a, uh, maturity on the, on the bomb structure, 600 million 
in, uh, in April. Uh, I was just wondering, uh, putting aside the potential disposals what your, um, what your plans for that would be? Would you look to refinance it or just, 
uh, repay it out of existing liquidity? 
Okay. 
Um, fantastic. Look, regarding the LTV goal, 
uh, our two LTV goal, the one that we were ambition to get, was something 
below 36%, more or less. This is what we were trained into, when we were caught by, 
uh, by the COVID-19, uh, pandemic. 
Um, we were going little by little, uh, of course, uh, this transaction would allow us to get there in one split second. 
Uh, but certainly, um, we like to, uh, be leveraged between… At this point in the cycle, between 35, 36% max. 
Uh, certainly with the transaction will go below. 
But that would give us also some extra muscle to do some other things, which in turn would generate new value that will also help reduce our, 
our, our leverage. 
In terms of what would be the effect on rating? Frankly speaking, I have no idea. 
I mean, uh, we live in Spain, uh, and rating agencies tend to be a little racist in that, uh, respect. 
So, you know, uh, with similar KPIs to us, 
uh, we have many peers in Europe which score triple B plus. 
So I hope that with, 
uh, the injection of capital that that sale will provide, we should go at least to triple B plus, 
but you never know. Because in reality, 
you know, uh, blaming the Spanish macro, blaming the sovereign cap, or blaming… I don't know. 
Uh, sometimes you get where you want. Sometimes you don't get there. 
But in any case, whether, uh, rating or not rating, at least I believe the market will appreciate the fact 
that our debt inaudible level goes down very significantly. Helping it goes down, uh, interest cover would significantly improved. 
So, you know, at the end, this is always important, uh, for the market. 
Regarding the debt maturity, in May 2022, it will be paid in cash. 
I mean we have the cash ready at the bank account. And are also piling up cash for the upcoming one in 2023. 
So we told the market that we will be, um, paying those maturities, uh, in the case of 22. 
Um, we will pay it as soon as we can because cash, cash today is costing us money. 
And the one in 23, eventually, particularly if we improve our rating, uh, we will certainly 
look, uh, to refinancing it. Because, 
you know, the last refinancing that we have done, even in the, in the middle of the pandemic, has represented an advantage of more than 100 bits in financial cost. 
Which is already noticeable in, in this quarter. I mean many people is asking us why the financial, uh, burden has gone so low? 
And one of the reasons is because our cost of debt now is, is lower than, than it was in the, in the past. 
Okay, great. Thank you very much. And our next question comes on the line of Ignacio 
Carvajal, from inaudible. Please go ahead with your question. 
Um, good afternoon, Ismael. My question have, have now been answered. So, so thank you very much. 
Okay. Ignacio, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alvero Sogliano from inaudible. Hello, um, 
thank you for the presentation Ismael. 
Um, thinking 2022, uh, what sort of cap ex, uh, quantum is budgeted, uh, for, for next year? Also including basement. 
That would be in my, my first question and then, um, can we have some color on, on the building process of the logistic, inaudible adjacent, adjacent to Madrid Airport? 
Um, and also I wonder if, uh, the DVA portfolio disposal will wait until Merlin is potentially awarded 
with that list hold, uh in the airport. Or you plan to dispose DVA even if you don't get, um, those plots. 
And also linked with the DVA disposal, what, what sort of buyers are interested on, on that asset 
in terms of, um, our pension plans or what, what sort of, uh, money is looking for those assets? 
Having in mind that DVA also has the right to match the offer that any potential buyer will make on the portfolio. Thank you. 
Okay. inaudible, regarding the 2022 CapEx, 
UH, we are currently in the process of defining the exact amount that will be, um, uh, budgeted for next year. Uh, 
I can tell you that it will be matched exactly with the, uh, proceeds that we expect to receive from sales of non core. In some cases the negotiations are already on 
their way. Uh, so we will make sure that, uh, sources and uses, much 
as we have always, uh, done. In fact this year, we are going to have slightly more sources than, than users. So we will carry on to the next year, uh, certain extra amount that can be employed 
in further CapEx, uh, for, for the company. 
Regarding the inaudible plot, uh, the process is highly competitive. 
And for us in reality, it has nothing, uh, to do with the inaudible decision. 
I mean that inaudible… Maybe you are referring to this end to inaudible, uh in, 
in, uh, which is somehow linked also to DVA. 
In the case of inaudible, uh, there are no news. I mean on the operation, on the operational side we continue to work hand in hand with the DVA, uh, to our satisfaction. 
I mean, uh, the underline bit. To our satisfaction, I mean, uh, the underlying business is going very well. In July, we obtained, uh, the signature of the infrastructure convention 
with the framework agreement, with all the public authorities which are involved in the, in the, in the development. 
So after that, which was the second condition precedent, according to the contract with the National Railway Authority, 
uh, we moved into formally requesting the transmission of the land from the, uh, National Railway Authority, 
uh, the term to obtain the transmission of the land will be by year end. 
Uh, however, with a high probability we believe the National Railway Authority will, will request a little extension till May next year. 
And, uh, if that is the case, that transmission of the land would operate in May next year. 
Uh, as soon as we receive the land, uh, from the National Railway Authority, the process or the project will, uh, will start. 
And at our current participation level, which is 14.5%, 
capex in this project, as we have demonstrated in a number of occasions, is relatively meaningless to us. 
So shouldn't be a concern for investors because, 
you know, the, the transmission or the purchase of the land, uh, needs a capex, uh, usage on our side of 40 million more or less, 
a little less. 
Uh, with soft costs etc. the capitalization of the vehicle company should be 45, 47 million, which 
is something that we have in our budget, and we'll take into account, of course, when considering capex floor for next year. 
And this is completely, 
um, not, not linked to, uh, to the, um, decision on the branch, uh, portfolio disposal 
because, at the end, you know, both things are not necessarily related. 
I mean, the only reason why we wanted to increase a little bit our, uh, percentage in the transaction 
is because, uh, we feel, uh, we are bringing some value added to the table, 
and we thought it would be good, in, in view of that value added to have a certain more outside return. 
I mean, so you know, bringing out a value added and getting 15% return is one thing. 
Uh, get, you know, bringing value add to the table and getting 35% return is a completely different thing. 
So that was all of our, let's say, ambition in the, in, in that, uh, regard. 
Um, the, many people ask us about the arbitration process. Well, the arbitration process is pending 
the final appointment of an arbitrar. 
And, uh, when this happens, which will happen before year end, 
the arbitrar will have five months to issue the bigger decision. 
So, you know, by end of first half next year, this will be resolved, uh, whether in favor of BBVA or in favor of us. 
You know, it's the law, so we will abide by whichever decision is taken by the arbitrator. 
For the time being at least, we obtained the injunction, so at least the modification of the values couldn't be ins- inscribed in the, in the mercantile register. 
So we are protected for the time being, but we will wait till the finalization of the arbitrage to, uh, to see what is the final outcome. 
Uh, the situation or the relationship with BBVA remains, uh, professional. 
Uh, we continue working together in the subject matter, which is the one that really matters in, in the development of, of DCN. 
And we continue working with them to our satisfaction with them and with the and with the company in which, you know, the investment piece is vehicled. 
So this is what I can, what I can tell you. And then, you asked me about potential buyers, uh, for BBVA. 
Look, uh, expanding on what I told, uh, Bart, we will not enter into this kind of discussion. 
Uh, you can imagine which kind of investors we are talking about, particularly when I said about separating the cash flows from the ownership. 
So you know why we are doing this, to obtain the best execution possible of the transaction, 
because we know the intrinsic value of the real estate. 
And, you know, if need be, one of the potential outcomes that we have, in some cases, considered is simply keeping the ownership of the asset ourselves 
because we have no problem with that and it will be a gift to whoever manages this company in year 2040. 
But, uh, the reason why we have separated is precisely to facilitate execution by a certain type of investors, who are particularly competitive in terms of cash flow discount. 
Okay. Thanks. Is my… Maybe, maybe 
I didn't ask the question in the right way, I'm, um, regarding BVA disposal. 
I was trying to understand how Merlin will recycle that proceeds from that portfolio when it eventually comes. 
And the three options, to me, are RN upload, increasing your stake on DCN, or going full speed in that data centers. 
So between those three options, leaving aside the debt repayment, which one is your preferred one? 
Uh, datacenters and greenfield logistics. I mean, basically our biggest, uh, yield on cost, uh, fields of activity. 
Uh, temporarily, of course, that lump sum will be used to reduce debt. But, over time, as we can start with leveraging a little bit, 
uh, the ultimate, uh, use of that money will be, 
uh, mainly the data center program, which for us is crucial for the future of, of the company. 
Uh, there will also be, uh, some extraordinary distribution to shareholders, 
because, as you know, there is this Spani- the Spanish legi- legislation, the Spanish for senior legislation, uh, is clear in that respect. 
So there will also be some, you know, no extraordinary dividend to shareholders arising from that, um, from that, uh, disposal. 
Perfect. Now, very clear. Thank you very much. Thank you, Abaro. 
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, to register your question, can you press star, one on your telephone keypad. Once again, it's star, one on your telephone keypad to register for questions. 
I think we have a follow-up question coming from the line of Fernando Alvaro from Alantra. Please go ahead. 
Now, uh… Sorry, my, my question was, has already been answered. Thank you. No problem, Fernando. Thank you, Fernando. 
Uh, our following question comes from line of Bertram Para Polo from Santa Lucia. Please go ahead. 
Hello. Good afternoon, everybody, and congratulations for your hard work on the nice numbers. 
Uh, just regarding, uh, I think, you were answering Ismail, regarding capital recycle. You said 
it was a question inaudible, inaudible, data centers, or greenfield logistics. 
Maybe, uh, seeing that you're that, let's say, your values of all your assets are resisting quite well and put in place, or maybe they'll start going up some 
time. It's no, no questions about buybacks. 
It's, you're talking about greenfields, and the logistics, and data center. That's very good. But how about buying your, your share at 40% discount, 
and really showing that your assets are not going down, but maybe up? And then let's say it's, it's, so no brainer when, when is this company going to start talking about their share buybacks? 
Bertram, uh, look, first, this is a decision, um, of our, both actors, but 
the problem is that, in Spain, it is not irrelevant like it would be in an Anglo-Saxon country to do a special dividend for a buyback. 
So in our case, 
uh, the eventual sale of a large number of assets, like for example, the portfolio we were commenting, 
will generate the need to distribute to shareholders a certain amount of money. 
If we were to use that certain amount of money to do a buyback, it would be a monster buyback. Fantastic, but it cannot be done legally. 
So we will need to distribute that amount of extra dividend to investors by way of law. 
So, uh, it is arguable whether it is better to distribute, 
uh, a lot of money to your shareholders, loyal shareholders, who are with you in the shareholding 
list of the company, or it is better to do a share buyback to the shareholders who want to exit the company. 
So that, yes, you are create the figures of the one who remain yes, 
but legally it's not… I mean, there is no point. We cannot do it. We have, we have to distribute an extra dividend. 
Yes, but not only about divestments, when you're inaudible value will go down, of course, you have to be, get back a certain amount of, of, of, let's say, the divestments, but you also could… 
I see now a gross cash position of, of, 
of 908 million. Why, why not start a little buyback and then show the market that, that the value of your assets are there, but there's not, not, never, never, uh, 
talking about that share buyback. Bertram, uh, 
look, 
uh, our non-core disposals, have already shown to the market that assets are fairly valued 
because even in the middle of the pandemic and in even the worst moment we have been disposal at or above, uh, GAV figures. 
So the market, for some reason, is, you know, inaudible to, to that information. 
Uh, even, if we dispose now a large amount of, uh, assets of the company, and we do it above book value, do you think the market will really care? 
Maybe they don't care. 
So we can't continue cannibalizing the company till we end up with zero assets and selling everything above NAV. 
And still, I don't know whether the market will notice or not notice. 
So what we are trying to… I, frankly speaking, if I have to give you my opinion, the share price re-rating will be immediate. 
I mean, there will be no need to artificially increase the price which is, at the end, what you are referring to. 
But you are asking me, why don't you artificially raise the price of the shares through a buyback? 
And, look, I, what I tell you is that I believe that if I do what I'm telling you, 
we should be capable of doing, the re-rating in the share price would be immediate 
with no need to do it through a buyback. 
Well, in my opinion, as well, all the shareholders pay, pay the management team money to, to add value to, let's say, the industrial way as you always have done, 
uh, but also to, to add value in a financial way. So I really do not agree that this is going very, artificial value because 
it's, it creates a lot of value to buy, let's say, shares up, let's say 40% discount to amortize that. 
And let's say, maybe in 10 years, 
instead of having, let's say, a 1.5%, maybe I have a 3% so, so it's… I, I, I don't know. 
Maybe you, you want to… For us, for us really loyal shareholders have been supporting that, this company through, through the tough times. 
I think that they deserve to really, to really, let's say, have more, more piece of the cake without putting more money. So really, 
I don't know who decides that, but we would really like a, a little buyback, and the company does not reflect it, the share price, more b- more buyback. 
inaudible. That's nonsense. 15.17 against ni- 96, it's, it's, it's, it's really a no brainer. Bertram, uh, 
I have all my net worth invested in this company, 
and I have been a financial investor for many, many years. 
So I have, I, I know the business of depleting the capital figure of companies. Uh, I know this business. 
But, you know, I believe it will be unnecessary. Anyway, 
it is opinionable like everything, and we can… I am happy to discuss with you. I know you particularly like the buybacks. 
I am happy to discuss with you, one-on-one, whenever you want because we live in the same city, so we can meet and discuss. 
And probably, there is no need to enter into a theoretical discussion about buybacks in this forum because it will be, uh, I will be… I, I think it's, it doesn't make sense. 
Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for your full answers. I appreciate the hard work. Thank you. You're welcome. 
inaudible, can you please let us know if there's any other questions you have? Uh, we appear to have no further question at this point. Okay. 
Well, in that case, we thank you all for joining today. It's, uh, nine months, 2021 trading update. 
Uh, as always, we remain at your disposal for any further questions. And, you know, if, if somebody needs a one-on-one meeting, please do not hesitate to come back to us. 
Thank you very much. Have a good weekend. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participations today, and this concludes with this conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.
