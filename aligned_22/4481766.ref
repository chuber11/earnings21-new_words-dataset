and the company's outlook for Q1 2022 and Q&A. 
foreign language. 
The technology presentation will be led by Min Yu Jin, in-charge of Life Display Promotion. 
The company's large OLED has been evolving and developing ever since its launch, culminating in the OLED.EX technology. 
foreign language. 
This presentation is in English with Korean subtitles at the bottom of the screen. 
Hi, I want to appreciate all of you for joining us today. I'm Min Yu Jin. I'm Head of Live Display Promotion Division. 
I'm proud to introduce to you almost an OLED evolution, OLED.EX. 
Evolutionary experience, the EX in OLED.EX embodies our goal of 
providing customers with an evolved experience through concerning evolving technology. 
Are we introduced to EX technology, the core of OLED.EX, which enables, um, evolved experience, 
EX technology improves product efficiency and brightness by increasing the stability of organic light emitting devices, 
which are the most important elements in creating great picture quality of OLED. 
And the two key step enable this technology are deuterium and personalized algorithms. 
Deuterium is an element also known as heavy hydrogen. And as the name implies, it return- returning as a similar structure to inaudible 
hydrogen, but it has an extra neutron. 
It is not artificially synthesized. It is a real natural element. 
However, there is only one item of deuterium for every 6,000 atoms of hydrogen. 
We developed the technology to extract deuterium from water to replace hydrogen in existing OLED materials. 
Our OLED materials maintain their original shape, but become more stable through our deuterium substitution process, 
meaning that they are stronger against electrical stimulation and heat, which means they remain more reliable for longer even at high brightness. 
In the end, we developed a highly stable device that emit brighter light. 
Using deuterium, OLED.EX can be realize a higher level of natural brightness and detail similar to what we've seen in real life. 
The second key to EX technology is personalized algorithms. 
We use personalized algorithms to control OLED's brightness and enhanced performance 
by predicting usage for each device according to viewing patterns of each user. 
I often display places I want to travel to after the pandemic, on my OLED TV. 
This is one of them. It is an aerial view of granted prismatic spring or hugely hot spring in Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. 
It looks almost like the sun blazing. Doesn't it? 
Some days, I live this scene for a long time, and the blue pixels on my OLED TV are, of course, used a lot 
for the blue part. The green parts use mostly green cell pixels. And as you can guess, the OLED parts use mostly lesser pixels. 
This is where our personalized hydrogen technology comes into play, 
intelligently predicting usage and optimizing each WRG and B element to maintain stable use. 
These personalized algorithms combined with deuterium, which we just talked about, give our OLED panels their strength. 
With EX technology, our OLED has evolved to become 
stronger than ever with 30% increased brightness and natural colors, we produce with greater detail. 
OLED.EX decrease details actually the way content creators intended. 
Design is also no exception when it comes to the evolution of OLED.EX. OLED.EX Introduces a new bezel that's about 30% thinner than before, 
making this the most aesthetically pleasing design of any existing OLED. 
We took innovative evolution a step further to satisfy the most and many 
consumers, without making any compromises to OLED's image quality or slim design. 
We can sum up OLED.EX philosophy of evolution with the word's, great detail, 
meaning detailed innovation to bring our customers' perfect picture quality. 
The reason why we bet on and focus the tenures of technical expertise on developing the detail is simple, 
because every detailed innovation results in the details in the content our customers experience. 
This is not only important for Hollywood filmmakers and other professionals, 
is also very important for everyone who wants to capture, get most in and fill every last detail. 
OLED.EX panels with EX technology will be used in all of our OLED TV panels from the second quarter of 2022. 
And we will continue to showcase new innovative products with pursuing natural reality, the philosophy that guides us. 
With OLED.EX, we will bring our customers evolved experience with OLED and show evolved leadership in the global OLED market. Thank you. foreign language. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Before we begin the presentation, 
please take… foreign language. 
Please note that today's results are based on consolidated IFRS standards prepared for your benefit and have not yet been audited by an outside auditor. 
foreign language. 

There has been a revision to the KIFRS number 1016 on property, plant and equipment. 
In applying the revision, the company modified how we account for prototypes that are sold during a planned test operation. 
foreign language. 
It used to be that the net selling price of the goods produced during test operation would be deducted as PPE as the acquisition cost. 
But with the amendment, the cost has to be recognized as profit or loss. foreign language. 
Early application of the amendment has caused some changes from our earnings in 2020. foreign language. 
With that said, we will now start with the presentation on Q4 2021 earnings results. foreign language. 
Let me start off with our business performance in Q4. 
foreign language. 


Revenue in Q4 was 8.881 trillion Yuan. 
It was driven by the higher share of large and medium and small OLED, 
and increase in IT panel shipment following the business structure upgrade. 
It was the highest ever for a quarter, up 22% Q-o-Q, and up 18% Y-o-Y. 
foreign language. 
Operating profit was 476 billion Yuan. 
It was down 10% Q-o-Q due to continued decline in LCD TV panel price and year-end one-off costs. 
In terms of actual performance, excluding the one-off factors, it was in line with market expectation. foreign language. 
Operating profit margin in Q4 was 5%, with EBITDA margin at 19%. Net profit was 180 billion Yuan. foreign language. 
Let me now go over our business performance for the year. foreign language. 
Revenue in 2021 was 29.878 trillion Yuan, and operating profit was 2.231 trillion Yuan. 
Revenue was the highest ever, while profitability was also considerably improved, 
thanks to the turnaround in OLED and upgrade in our business structure. 
foreign language. was 
up 23% Y-o-Y. 
We turned around to profit with operating profit margin of 7%. 
foreign language. area shipment 
and 
area inaudible ASP. foreign language. 
Area shipment in Q4 was 9.36 million square meters, increasing 12% from the previous quarter. 
IT panel shipment remained solid, and large OLED panel shipments grew on the back of strong demand for high-end TV. foreign language. 
Area panel price was $806, up 8% Q-o-Q, thanks to shipment growth in large and medium small OLED. 
foreign language. 
The company's production capacity in Q4 decreased 3% Q-o-Q, owing to line adjustment to prepare for new models and additional allocation to R&D. foreign language. 
Next is Q4 revenue breakdown by product segment. 
foreign language. 




IT panel, our standout among competition maintained the biggest portion at 42%. 
TV panels came in next with 27%, down 5% points Q-o-Q, despite higher shipment of large OLED, 
due to declining LCD TV panel price. 
Mobile and others accounted for 31%, up 8% points Q-o-Q, thanks to growth in shipment of P- OLED smartphones and wearables. foreign language. 
Next is the company's financial position and ratios. foreign language. 
The company's cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q4 was 4.3 trillion yuan. 
Inventory was 3.35 trillion yuan, decreasing by 230 billion yuan Q-o-Q. foreign language. 
The inventory is kept at 
a higher level than usual as a safety stock to prepare against supply chain uncertainties such as commodities and logistics issues. 
foreign language. 


Liabilities to equity ratio was 158%, and current ratio was 94%, both almost flat Q-o-Q. 
Net debt-to-equity ratio came in at 57%, improved by 6% points Q-o-Q. 
It was down 20% points Y-o-Y, showing meaningful improvement in financial soundness. foreign language. 
Next is cash flow. The company's cash and cash equivalents at the start of Q4 was 4.209 trillion yuan. 
It increased by 75 billion yuan, and stood at 4.285 trillion yuan at the end of Q4. foreign language. 
Next is presentation by the company's new CFO, Sang-Don Kim, on business performance and strategy. foreign language. 
Good afternoon, and good evening to shareholders, investors and analysts from home and abroad. foreign language. 
This is LG Display's CFO, Sang-Don Kim. 
foreign language. I went from being… 
I went from, uh, being in charge of finance, uh, to CFO last year, and I greet you for the first time today through this conference call. 
As the 
new CFO, I feel the responsibility of having to deliver on the company's strategic tasks under an increasingly volatile business environment 
with the persistent pandemic and intensifying competition. 
But I also harbor expectations of new opportunities as we see our strategic push in the past few years 
to upgrade the business structure and better prepare for the future bear fruit. 
So with the sense of heavy responsibility, being the CFO at such a critical juncture, 
I will play an active role in improving corporate performance while balancing opportunities and risks. 

With that now, let me move on to the guidance for Q1 2022, as well as the company's business strategy. 
First is Q1 guidance. 
In Q1, area shipment will decline by mid to high single digit QOQ. 


But the pace of seasonal decline will not be as much as in other years. 
Although shipment of panels of all sizes is expected to fall due to seasonality, 
IT panel continues to enjoy B2B demand coming from the increasing trend of work from home, online education 
and general changes in the office environment. 
But area price is expected to fall by mid to high teen digit QOQ due to seasonal decline in shipment of mobile panel. 
Next is operational strategy for each business. 
Looking back on the past year, 
we were able to show meaningful results in our core strategic tasks even as COVID-related volatility and uncertainty continued. 
More importantly, OLED is now at a stage where it can produce substantive results. 

Although the TV set market saw negative growth of over 10% last year, sales of OLED TV sets grew over 60%, 
driving the expansion in the overall high end TV market. 
The high end TV market grew at a 30% level 
YOY, with OLED TV's share in this market surpassing 30% as of Q4 last year. 
Panel shipment recorded a remarkable growth of more than 70% YOY and the business turned around to profit in the second half of last year, 
reaching the BEP level for the year. 
Continuing from last year, shipment growth for this year is planned at 20% for the year. 
We also plan to keep improving profitability based on the stronger business performance. 
In the case of small and medium OLEDs, we became capable of ensuring consistency in development, mass production and quality. 
It is now in a stable growth path based on stronger relations with strategic partners. 
In mobile business, we aim to further improve profitability by expanding new models in the second half. 
We will leverage our unique competitiveness 
to broaden outside the mobile, preempt medium size OLED premium market and expand to the mobility industry, including automobiles. 

The LCD sector also achieved outstanding results by proactively responding to market changes. 
In LCD, we are maintaining the select and focus approach, centered on high end IT, in line with our strategic positioning. 
This year is expected to see demand adjustment after 
COVID-19. 
The company continues to secure stability in business operation by minimizing volatility. 
We are gradually reducing the portion of supply-demand businesses that are highly susceptible to market conditions 
while increasing the businesses that can produce consistent results in strategic 
collaboration with customers. 
Going further anchored on OLED, 
we will continue to expand our business to deliver new experience and values to customers, going beyond existing product areas. 
Last is our investment and financial management activities. 
CapEX last year was KRW 3.2 trillion. 
It is expected to increase this year as we go- go ahead with the investment in small and medium OLED that was decided last year. 
The company will keep to the principle of keeping CapEx within EBITDA 
while trying to improve our financial soundness. 
The 
company announced today a predictable and sustainable midterm dividend policy with the view to improve shareholder value. 
We will maintain a dividend payout ratio of 20% of the consolidated net profit 
from the business years of 2021 to 2023. 
Accordingly, the BOD today decided on KRW 650 per share in cash dividend for the 2021 business year. 
The company will keep looking for ways to improve shareholder value from a long-term perspective. 
Pandemic 
lingers, we inaudible will bolster our responsiveness to the external environment to minimize risk and ensure stability in business operations. 

We will spare no effort to continuously heighten market confidence and create higher values. 
Thank you. 
That brings us to the end of earnings presentation for Q4 2021. 
We will now take questions 
inaudible 
session. 
Now, Q&A session will begin. Please press star one, that is star and one, if you have any questions. 
Questions will be taken according to the order you have pressed the number star one. For cancellation, please press star two, that is star and two, on your phone. 
In order to allow as many Q&A chances as possible within the restricted time, we'd appreciate only two questions per each participant. 
The first 
question will be provided by Hong-sik Kim from Hana Financial Investments. Please go ahead with your question. 
Uh, 


I have two questions, uh, one on large OLED and another on LCD. 
Now first about the large OLED, so what was the performance in 2021 and the outlook for 2022? 
So, are there any differences between the guidance last time about the 2021 performance and the expected shipment in 2022? 
And also, what was the profitability for this business division? So, for 2021 and also the outlook for 2022. 
And the second question is on LCD. 
So the LCD panel price has been falling for the seven- seventh month now, 
but then we are also now seeing some signs of the price decline stopping for 30-inch and 40-inch LCD panels, 
then what is the, uh, panel price outlook for LCD this year? So for IT, we see that the I- IT LCD panel price 
also started to decline last month. 
So what is, uh, similar question, so what is the price outlook for IT panel this year? 

Now regarding the first question about the large OLED, uh, this is Daniel Lee, in charge of large display marketing, responding to that. 
Now 
first 
of 
all, as the CFO had highlighted earlier, the overall TV set market showed negative growth of over 10% last year 
but, uh, among them, the OLED, uh, TV, in other words, the high end 
TV, uh, continued to grow and OLED TV solidify its position in the high end TV market. 
So in the fourth quarter of last year, the OLED TV took up over 30% in the high end TV market. 
To give you more highlights, uh, what we see as the… some, uh, meaningful, uh, performances, so in the 
developed markets, like the North America market, for the year, it took up over a 30% market share, and in Europe, it was over 40% for the year. 
Now not 
only the sales of the TV set but, uh, accordingly, uh, the company's panel shipment also grew by over 70% YOY. 
So in the second half, it turned around to profit and for the year, it reached BEP. 
Now in 
terms of the specific shipment, uh, we did fall a little bit short of the target in terms of the shipment, 
but then in terms of the area, we did, uh, come in line with the target as we had focused more on the large OLED. 
This 
year, as the CFO had reported earlier, we, 
uh, our guidance is, uh, over 20% of increase in panel shipment. 
And 

the more recent numbers show, although they are for the weekly sales, but, uh, so in the month of January, 
we see that the actual sales, uh, remain similar to the fourth quarter level. 
And based on our strong, uh, stronger business structure, we will continue to improve our profitability. 
The following question will be presented by inaudible from HI Investment Securities. Please go ahead with your question. 
Uh, we 
apologize for the inconvenience, we had not finished the response to the first question by Mr. Kim Hong-sik, so allow us to, uh, complete the response and then we will take the next question. 
Now this is inaudible, in charge of business intelligence, responding to your question about the outlook for IT panel price. 
Now for the IT panel, compared to the TV, the decline in price was lagging behind by about a quarter. 
So we believe that in terms of the stabilization of the prices, it will also come later than the TV… of 
the prices, it will also come later than 
the TV price. foreign language 
But then we believe that, uh, most of the IT panel price decline will be centered on the low end products, like TN or EVA, 
and for the high end products where the company's strong, we 
believe that the price will remain stable. foreign language 
That is all. 
foreign language Now, 


this is inaudible from the medium small display marketing. 
And, uh, just now regarding the IT market outlook, there was explanation by, uh, inaudible from business intelligence, but I would like to just add some additional explanation. 
foreign language Regarding the ai-… uh, the demand 
outlook for IT, 
now as the pande-… so since the, uh, onset of the pandemic, there was the trend of working from home as well as online education, 
which, uh, drove the demand for IT products. 
But now, as COVID-19 continues to be prolonged, we are also seeing the easing of restriction in different parts of the world 
and now are increasing outdoor activities by the citizens. 
So, uh, this means that the B2C demand is likely to go down, 
but then, for the B2B, now because of the back to office trend as well as the, uh, recovery in the economy throughout the world, 
we believe that the B2B demand in 2022 will remain strong. 
foreign language Now, 
for the demand itself then, uh, between 2022 and 2021, 
uh, the outlook is that they are going to be, uh, pretty much similar. So a flat demand between 2021 and 2022. 
But then, when it comes to supply, 
uh, because of the soft TV market last year, starting in the second half of last year, much of the supply on the TV side has been shifted to IT, 
which had prompted the decline in IT prices in- starting in the, uh, last part of last year. 
foreign 
language So, for the short term we believe that the 
IT price decline, which started in the latter part of last year, will continue for the time being. 
But then, in terms of the pace of the decline, 
now that is mostly concentrated in the mainstream products, whereas the company is strong in the high end products. 
So we do believe that, uh, our business will remain stable compared to the overall market. foreign language 
We will take the next question. 
foreign language 
The following question will be presented by inaudible for Hi Investment Securities. Please go ahead with your question. 
foreign 
language 
Now, 
I also have two questions. First is what has actually been, uh, reported through media coverage extensively recently, 
and that is about the, uh, cooperation between Samsung Electronics and LG Display. Uh, Samsung Electronics deciding to adopt LG Display's white OLED. 
Now, uh, so if you could give us an update on this front. And if you… and this probably means that we- 
you are in the, uh, last stage. So, can you give us, uh, comments regarding this? 
And the second question is, uh, Samsung Display also recently, uh, got ready for the… or started the mass production of QD- OLED. 
Now then, compared to the QD- OLED, uh, what does the company believe are the advantages of white OLED? 
foreign language 
This is the 
CFO responding to the first part of the question. 
Uh, given that this involves not only the company but a specific customer, 
please understand that it- we are not in the position to give a comment on it or share our plan or update. 
foreign language 
And I already explained earlier that the high end TV… So in the high end TV the, uh, OLED achieved, uh, outstanding performance, 
and the company's plan is to continue with this growth trend based on the existing customer base. 
foreign 
language But, uh, if new customers are to be gained, then, uh, in terms of the, uh, 
OLED, uh, we do believe that it will have a positive impact on increasing sales of OLED in the premium market. 
foreign language foreign language 

And this is Daniel Lee in charge of large display marketing responding to the se- second part of the question. 
foreign language So the 

second question was about the advantages of the company's OLED over QD- OLED. 
And as had been explained earlier, now the launch of the OLED products by other players 
is a- a welcome development for our part, because it would help 
mainstream the premium OLED products 
and will also have a positive, uh, impact on driving sales. foreign language 
And it is true that there had been some media exposure at the CES, but then the actually product has not been launched in the market yet. 
So, uh, any comparison would have to wait until it's been launched. 
foreign language 

But I would just like to add that when it comes to the product competitiveness, it does not depend on one or two, uh, specific, uh, specifications. 
So I believe that, uh, what is important is the overall quality as well as the overall competitiveness. 
And I do believe that the market will be able to make that decision after the launch. 
foreign language 

And now, 
given our history of more than 10 years since the launch, as well as business operation, 
and also based on our product competitiveness and cost competitiveness, 
as well as the, uh, economy of scale and the customer base, as well as the, 
uh, readiness of our differentiated product lineup, 
we do believe that we are enjoying an overall competitiveness and we main… uh, we intend to maintain this, uh, competitive edge. foreign language foreign language 
We will take the next question. foreign language 
The following question will be presented by inaudible from Samsung Securities. Please go ahead with your question. 
foreign language Now, I also had, uh, 






two questions, but then, uh, I also have one, uh, request for clarification, uh, about the presentation earlier. 
So it was explained that for the fourth quarter financial performance, 
excluding, uh, one-off factors or the one-off cost, 
then the performance was actually not… believe I heard about the- the one off factors, so maybe I missed it. But, uh, if you could clarify what the one-off factors were. 
And then, uh, the next question is, uh, we have been hearing… hear more about the- 
the outlook. So if you could give us some more high- highlights about the auto display. 
And, uh, if you believe that there are, uh, growth drivers for auto display, then do you believe that they will come from applications, or the display form, or from the customers? 
And the last question is, 
now, since the pandemic we see many of the panel makers enjoying, uh, higher sales as well as profitability. 
But then we see that, uh, like Taiwanese, uh, panel maker is enjoying, like, over 20% up rate in profit margin in the third quarter of last year. 
And of course the company has also done quite well, but then 
I'm just, uh, wondering about the difference. And also, uh, when it comes to the company strengthening its competitiveness, then what do you believe, 
uh, its implications will be, uh, with regards to the margin as well? foreign language 
This is the CFO, uh, regarding your question about the one-off costs. 
Now, when it comes to business performance, we have a way of sharing the good performance with investors in the form of dividend. 
Likewise we also have a way of sharing our performance with those who made it possible, in other words the executives and the, 
uh, employees of the company. 
foreign language 
And the reason why I cannot give you the specific numbers today is 
because we have not gone through the communication with the members of the company about how we are going to share the business performance. 
So please understand that, uh, it's a bit too early for us to give you further details, 
but once we do go through the process, then we will, uh, create opportunities where we will be able to communicate with you 
on a one to one basis. foreign language 
This is inaudible, Vice President of Auto Marketing, responding to your question about auto display. 
foreign language Now, 
first about the status of our auto business. 
As is well known, LG Displays enjoys leadership in the auto business in terms of both sales and technology. 
foreign language And especially, uh, 
with the auto display, uh, the size becoming bigger and the resolution requirement also becoming higher 
and also more, uh, sophisticated requirement for design, the orders that we receive continue to grow. 
And as a result of this, for LG Display, 
the, uh, order backlog for the LTPS LCD and OLED remains at 90% as of the end of 2021. 
foreign language 
And then about our auto business strategy. Now, 
LG Display, uh, intends to have a customized platform for the different market segments, as well as the customers. 
foreign language 
Now, 
for the, 
uh, auto conditions. Now, in terms of the extreme conditions that are required for the auto display, now, the 
LG Display, uh, will, uh, center it's, uh, marketing on the tandem OLED. 
So, for the customers that, uh, value design, then we will provide our plastic OLED. 
foreign language foreign language 

And for the customers who value the higher picture quality, then we can also provide the ATO, which is advanced thin OLED. 
So based on these two technologies, we will be able to continue to broaden our market, as well as the customer base, uh, utilizing our OLED platform. 
foreign language 
And last, uh, for those, uh, who wish to differentiate by cost, 
then, uh, we can 
also, uh, market our inaudible touch based LTPS LCD. foreign language That is all. foreign language 
And this is, uh, inaudible from BI responding to your question about the difference in profitability with other players. 
foreign language Now, the profitabili-… uh, the profitability, uh, 
difference in the LCD business comes from the differences in the customer structure, as well as the product lineup. 
foreign language Now, when we look at the history of display business, then we see that, when there is a higher share of a commodity or general, uh, LCD products, 
then when the market is doing well, then the profitability also tends to improve considerably. 
And then visa versa. When the market is not doing well, then there could be big losses. 
foreign language So, uh, 
we see that for the, like the Taiwanese player 
that have a larger share of, uh, other customers and also larger share of commodity products, 
uh, they have… we see that they have benefited more than other players during the pandemic. 
foreign language 
As was explained earlier, we see that the price is, uh, falling centered on commodity product, 
and for the company, we are focusing more- more on differe- 
differentiating for the long term. And we believe that, uh, we will be r- ready to have a more, uh, stable business down the road. foreign language foreign language 
We will take one last question. 
foreign 
language The 
following 
question will 
be presented by Simon Woo from 
Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question. foreign language Now, first of all, uh, thank you for the good performance in the 
fourth quarter, and my question is pertaining to the growth potential down the road. 
Because we see that the, uh, OLED capacity is almost, uh, to the full and the new, uh, ramp up can come only, like, in a year's time. 
Then in 2022, do- does the company believe that there is still room for more top line growth to come fro OLED? 
Perhaps maximizing utilization rate and also enhancing productivity, uh, could help, uh, pull up the growth rate, but then it would also limitations. 
So what is the company's outlook for the… for the growth of OLED? foreign language 
This is Hee-Yeon Kim of corporate strategy group. 
foreign language So, the 
question is pertaining to the growth potential of large OLED. Now, regarding this, we see that, uh, recently the market is moving more towards convergence. 
foreign language So, 



under this trend of convergence, we believe that there will be more opportunities for the company. 
So, for example, based on the WRGB technology, uh, we can supply to the TV market, not only that, but IT in their gaming side, 
and then also utilizing our unique, uh, transparent feature for OLED, we can also get ready to move into the mob… the, uh, mobile market. 
And in this market for these products, the ASP would be higher than the TV. 
So it is from both, uh, the revenue growth and also higher profitability that we are seeking to achieve top line growth. 
foreign language So, in short, uh, 



more growth will come after CAPEX spend. 
So, for example, there's going to be the CAPEX on the, um, begin from 2024, 
so there is going to be a higher sales from here. 
And also, even without CAPEX, uh, spend, uh, from the gaming and the transparent OLED side, 
the ASP is going to be higher than other applications. 
So, um, let me make one correction. So, about the, uh, transparent display. So it's not, uh, getting ready to enter the mobile, but it's the mobility market. 
foreign language 
Thank 
you very much 
for the good explanation. And then this question is to the CFO. So, you did emphasize the company's intent to keep the CAPEX within EBITDA. 
But then, given the fact that the EBITDA has grown considerably from the past, 
uh, from the investor's perspective, perhaps, uh, keeping it in line with depreciation and amortization would be more reasonable? 
Uh, because now the dividend payout is likely to be around 200 billion, 300 billion won. 
So there is the EBTIDA and then there is also the taxes to be paid, and then the- setting aside the working capital. 
Uh, after all this, then the cash is likely to be quite tight. So, uh, what is the company's, uh, view on this comment? 
foreign 
language So, this is the CFO and I take that as a, uh, suggestion or a recommendation to the company, and we will take that comment into due consideration. 
foreign language 
Now, as you all know very well, a part of the nature of this business is that it requires large scale investment. 
foreign language And 

I'm sure that you also understand that this is indispensable, uh, to make sure that we achieve sustainability 
and also continued profitability, 
which are also the, uh, aspiration of both the company and the shareholders. foreign language Aware of this. 
But then, uh, for the company, 
uh, to make sure that we get the right returns on our investment, 
uh, we have, and I also have, uh, five rules and one additional rule. foreign language 
First, uh, we look at the… 
w- we look at whether there is alignment between the planned investment and the company's mid to long term strategy. 
foreign language And 

we also look at the market demand, and also more, uh, importantly, recently the market supply, 
as well as, uh, the- our selling capability, and also our production capacity. 
In other words, we also look at the fit between ou- our current condition and the planned investment. 
foreign language And we 
also look at the timeliness of the investment. In other words, between the time of making the investment until the mass production, 
then will the production be in time for the market? 
And also whether it is the right time for the company to make this kind of investment; whether the company has the fundamentals to withstand this. 
foreign language 
And of course also the economics, which are also the, uh, more immediate 
factor. foreign language 
And we also look at the technological feasibility. In other words, whether the company has the right technology and the technological sophistication befitting this investment. foreign language 
So that is, 
uh, from the business performance side. And then, uh, the one additional rule for the finance side, 
and that is whether we have the financial resources to make this investment at this time. 
And if, uh, we lack such financial resources, then how are we going to finance that from the market? 
foreign language Now, for the CAPEX plan of the year, as was explained earlier, uh, we will… 
uh, we intend to keep it within EBITDA. 
foreign language 
And we are moving ahead with the investment with the answers to all of those five plus one rules, 
uh, with the conviction that it is the investment that, uh, we need. 
So I hope for your, uh, patience for a bit, 
and I do hope that you'll be able to share in the good performance out of it. And I also hope that the time until then will become shorter. foreign language 
Thank you. foreign language 
That brings us to the end of the conference call for the, uh, earnings presentation of LG Display Q4 2021.
