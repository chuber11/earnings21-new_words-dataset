Thank you Brad and thank you everyone for participating in today's call. 
I could not be more proud of our exceptional third quarter performance, 
making our fourth consecutive quarter over years relative growth 
and another period of record results across many of our key metrics. 
We achieved yet another quarter of record revenue, 
with 29% growth in the U. S. which represented 95% of our total revenue. 
This outside growth was led by our single-family residential cells. 
Sales continue 
to surpass our expectations 
and largely reflect the strong demand 
from our best class products across the South reserve. 
We also strengthened our commercial foothold in inaudible market throughout the country 
with a growing backlog of commercial projects to invoice 
through 2022. 
Building in our private cell performance, we were able to grow by 36% 
to a new record of 39 million for the third quarter. 
Record levels improved by 220 points year 
over year, to 29.7%. 
This performance was due to the strongest sales I mentioned previously, 
along with cost controls and the benefits of previously implemented high returning measurements 
producing a gross of 39.6%, which is also a record for the third quarter. 
Furthermore, continued momentum in our single-family residential business which has the shortest cash cycle, 
combined with careful working capital management collectively helped to generate our seventh straight quarter of robust cash flow. 
At a quantity record of nearly 33 billion. 
This allowed us to pay back, while investing further in our capabilities like a inaudible 
to address the expensive growth we had. 
As a result of our platform, we 
continue to enjoy a health and 
competitive advantage that has mostly insulated for widespread supply chains with 
options. 
Our structural advantages, produce a visual advantantage, as no other existing customer value or inaudible, continuity 
of product availability, and basic quality. 
Based on our success so far this year 
and the opportunities we see, we are pleased to increase our full year revenue and adjust to meeting that growth, which 
Geraldo will discuss later in the call. 
In conclusion, we expect to continue executing 
our highly probable growth strategy and generating cash flow to deliver a visual value for our shareholders. 
With the thanks of our balance sheet and for flexibility, 
we are extremely confident in our ability to achieve our gross of inaudible. 
We have a highly efficient vertical integrator and local operations, with an expensive portfolio. 
It's a top of the line product and should allow us to continue winning in our market. 
I will now turn the call over to Chris, to provide the visual details for the record backlog. 
Thank you Jose-Manuel. 
The strength of our ability to execute our growth and strategy as a U.S. centered company, while providing exceptional service to our customers. 
We were thrilled to build on top of our first half, 2021 momentum. 
On the third quarter we gained shares, delivering new products offered and expanding our network. 
During the quarter, we were pleased to begin invoicing products under our new multi max product lines, which started production home builders, 
as well as legacy and new dealers. 
This is an opportunity that we believe represents significant upside to our long-term goals potential. 
Beyond new products, we are seeing a sharp acceleration of goals in our prestige and elite single-family residential product lines. 
We continue to expect strong growth in single-family through share gain, held by a continued positive overall housing environment in the U.S. 
In addition, 
we have a number of commitments and multi-family projects, which help to grow our backlog to a new record level of 575.8 
million at quarter end. 
As it related to commercial indicators, we have been pleased 
to see increases in the ABI Index. 

The September ABI Index increased to 56.6% compared to 55.6% in August. 
Remaining in expansion territory and consistent with levels not seen since the early 2019. 
At 575.8 million our third level backlog level, represents more than 1.2 times our trailing 12 months revenue. 
Providing that with solid visibility and commercial demand through 2022. 
The U.S. continues to represent an increasing share product, accounting for over 86% of our third quarter backlog. 
Approximately 2 / 3 of our backlog is comprised of medium and high rise residential projects, as well as single-family residential production. 
While 1 / 3 is related to a wide array of commercial products. 
A reminder, our single-family residential grwoth trajectory is not fully capturing our backlog, 
this is due to the shorter terms. 
Looking ahead, our strong cashflow generation capabilities are rising vertically and integrated advantages have allowed us to invest significantly in gross markets. 
During the third quarter, we spent 10 million in gross to automate a third class processing line, enhance our self-coding facility, and 
expand our aluminum production capacity to address incremental demand. 
We believe growth investments, such as this will help us address the expected growth we foresee through 2022. 
We previously discussed store capacity and incremental efficiencies 
anticipated to become operational by the fourth quarter of 2021, or early in the first quarter of 2022. 
We expect to have the necessary historic capacity to significantly span our invoicing capabilities well beyond current levels. 
I will now turn the call over to Santiago, on slide six, to discuss the strong demand for a single-family products, 
vertically integrated strategy, and financial results and improve our look for the year. 
Thank you Christian. Our third quarter results represent yet another quarter of consistent execution, 
followed years of investment in technology enhancements, our facilities, 
as well as strategic positioning in U.S. single-family residential market. 
In the third quarter, we were thrilled to expand upon our exceptional first half 2021 performance. 
We saw our momentum continue primarily through share gains and new business wings in our single-family business. 
This momentum resulted in our total revenue increasing to new record levels, 
notably our single-family revenues increased 213% year over year. 
Representingâ€¦ 213% year over year, representing 48% of our third quarter US revenues, and 35% of our US sales on an LTM basis, 
reflecting new business wins, and market share again. 
Our sales continue to benefit from our vertically integrated business model and strategically located operations. 
The accelerating demand for our products is attributable to our ability to supply superior quality products with shorter lead times at an attractive value. 
As Chris mentioned, while our single family sales in the third quarter were primarily comprised of our prestige, and elite product lines, 
we were thrilled to begin invoicing orders for our MultiMax product lines targeting production home builders. 
Regardless of our future volatility in the housing market, or forward-looking indicators such as housing stats, 
we expect this product line to offer pure upside to our already strong residential sales, 
as we continue to focus on expanding our single family presence through dealership expansion and geographic diversification. 
Looking at slide seven, 
we would like to draw your attention to the factors driving our success and above market growth in 2021, 
helping us to differentiate TechnaGlass as the architectural glass provider of choice in the US, 
as we have discussed in previous quarters, 
our strategically located 
vertically integrated and low-cost operations provide us with sustainable competitive advantages compared to our peers. 
Our structural advantages and significant investments in our operations continue to facilitate our ability to quote more projects, 
expand customer relationships, 
and deliver products with much shorter lead times than the current industry average, 
our vertical integration in joint venture with Sangobond 
allows us significant control over our purchasing and transportation costs, with no material pressures from raw material costs or material availability. 
Also, we have not experienced any significant wage cost increases or labor constraints. 
Additionally, energy costs continue to be stable, 
given our ability to source energy from our solar panel generation, and natural gas cogeneration. 
Collectively, it has enhanced our ability to deliver attractively priced products in a timely manner, 
and in turn, unlock opportunities to build new relationships, entrench ourselves with existing customers, and drive market share again. 
On slide number eight, we display the areas where we believe we have already made significant achievements across the ESG spectrum. 
We were pleased to further highlight our commitment to environmental, 
social, and governance responsibilities through our 2020 sustainability report published a few weeks ago. 
Throughout our years, as a public company, 
we have worked to serve all of our stakeholders from implementing green technology, such as our 15 million 
investment in solar technology for our facilities, 
to our efforts to develop TechnaGlass as an employer of choice in Colombia, 
by way of our investments in our employee and corporate culture. 
On slide nine, we have provided a high level view of the goals we will seek to achieve on a go-forward basis, 
as outlined in our report. 
We have designed and continuously implement strategies aimed to encourage the efficient use of materials and resources, 
as well as the development of environmentally friendly technologies. 
We also look to responsibly manage the value chain and the lifecycle of the products we sell. 
And we do all of this to offer our partners innovative and best-in class products that are environmentally friendly 
and energy efficient. 
TechnaGlass remains dedicated to corporate social responsibility in our 2020 reports marks another important milestone 
in our ESG journey. 
Let's now discuss our third quarter financials, starting with revenue drivers on slide number 11. 
Total revenues increased 26% year over year to a record 130.4 million for the third quarter. 
In the US, which represents 94% of our total revenues, 
we saw growth of approximately 29% to a record 123.2 million, 
compared to 95.7 million in the prior year quarter. 
This strength was primarily driven by strong growth in our single family housing activity in market share games that I discussed previously. 
This more than offset the air pocket in commercial activity, as projects in our backlog that have resumed progress to the latter stage of construction 
when architectural glass is typically installed. 
Based on conversations with customers, we believe commercial is on track to recover as we move early into 2022. 
Looking at the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on slide number 12. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2021 increased 36.1% to a record 38.7 million, 
compared to 28.5 million in the prior year quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%. 
A third quarter record in a strong 220 basis points improvement compared to the prior year period. 
We were pleased to produce record third quarter gross profit on both $1 and margin base. 
Our gross profit increased 28.7% to 51.6 million, 
representing a gross margin of 39.6%. 
This compared to gross profit of 40.1 million in the prior year quarter, 
representing a gross margin of 38.8%. 
Our 80 basis point improvement in margin was mainly attributable to greater operating efficiencies in a higher mix of revenue from manufacturing versus installation activity, 
given our increased mix of single family residential products, where we do not carry out installation. 
Higher nominal operating expenses for the quarter 
mainly reflected higher variable expenses related to marine and ground transportation and commissions. 
As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were lower by 280 basis points compared to the prior year period, 
due to higher revenues and better operating leverage on personnel, professional fees, and other fixed expenses. 
Now, looking at our balance sheet and leverage profile on slide number 13. 
To reiterate a point made in previous quarters, the recapitalization of our debt structure last October 
in our outstanding track record of cash flow generation has significantly enhanced our financial flexibility. 
In the third quarter, 
we were proud to record operating cash flow of 33 million at an 84% conversion from adjusted EBITDA. 
Over the past 12 months, we have generated operating cash flow of 114 million, 
representing 85% of adjusted EBITDA. 
Our higher margin, shorter cash cycle single family revenues, combined with exceptional working capital management, and low interest expense 
are all helping to drive additional shareholder value. 
The transformation in our ability to generate significant cash, 
left us well positioned to deploy capital opportunistically during the quarter. 
To that end, we spent 10 million in growth CapEX in the quarter in order to address affected demand. 
This move 
aligns with our strategy to invest in further operational efficiencies, and allows us to prepare for the additional growth we expect in the quarters ahead. 
We expect these investments to be operational late in the fourth quarter 2021 or early first quarter of 2022. 
In addition to investments in our operations, we use excess capital to voluntarily prepaid 30 million of debt under our syndicated term loan facility during the quarter. 
We were pleased to achieve a lowest leverage ratio in the company's history, 
which decrease to 0.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end. 
Furthermore, our joint venture with Sangobond to construct our previously announced second state-of-the-art float glass plant in Barranquilla 
remains on track to break ground in the first half of 2022. 
As we discussed in the past, our capital contributions toward that project have already been completed. 
So we don't expect any additional CapEx as it relate to the project. 
Moving to our outlook on slide number 15. 
Based on our strong third quarter performance, and continued momentum in 2021, 
as well as our solid demand outlook, through inaudible, we are increasing our full year 2021 out. 
We now expect full year 2021 revenues of 485 to 495 million, 
representing growth of 31% at the midpoint. 
We continue to expect the US to represent the significant majority of our growth. 
Based on the sales outlook and anticipated mix of revenues, 
we're raising our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of 140 to 145 million, 
representing 46% growth at the midpoint of the range as well as margin expansion. 
Our gross margins should continue to benefit from our high return CapEX investments in automation initiativesâ€¦ 
high return CapEx investments in automation initiatives, as well as our proven ability to efficiently manage cost. 
As a reminder, we do not carry out installation for our single family residential sales. 
However, we do carry out installation for many of the commercial projects in our backlog. 
Based on our strong year-to-day mix of single family 
revenues, and our faster growth in that end market, we still anticipate a larger mix of higher margin product versus installation revenue for full year 
2021 compared to the prior year. 
That said, given the anticipated sequential increase in the mix of our commercial revenues that include installations, 
we expect our margins to normalize to a high 30% level in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
We expect CapEx in 2021 to be approximately 35 million, with a large portion of these expenses going towards 
further automation and growth investments to efficiently manage increasing demand for our products. 
Maintenance CapEx continues to represent less than 2% of our sales. 
In summary, we are extremely pleased with our exceptional performance to date in 
2021, and are happy to see strong returns from our business enhancements initiatives over the past few years. 
Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and our very conservative leverage profile 
positions us well to generate ongoing value creations for shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our unique, very clean integrated platform to target new customer relationships and further penetrate the US single family residential market 
to our innovative products and superior lead times. 
We believe these key differentiators, along with our prudent growth investment, will continue to provide greater returns for our shareholders as we move into 2022. 
With that, we will be happy to answer your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions. 
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. 
A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. 
You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. 
For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. 
Thank you. Our first question comes from a line of Tim Rogers with Bair. Please proceed with your question. Hey, uh, hey everybody. Good morning. Nice, uh, nice job. 
Good morning. May- maybe just, um, to, to start on residential, you know, obviously, you know, clearly a lot of momentum behind that business, business line. Um, I, 
I guess at this point, what's your vi- visibility for residential into next year? And I, I guess you, you just did, you know, basically $60 million in sales this quarter. 
Um, do you think that's a, a proper kinda baseline, you know, to use moving forward? I mean, can we effectively annualize that? 
Yes, I believe, uh, that is a bottom line. As a matter of fact, we believe we are gonna keep increasing our residential line 
and, uh, 
that $60 million per quarter is aligned with what we believe is the bottom line for, for, uh, 
for that line of business. 
Okay. And, and when you think about the opportunity, maybe just ev- even in Florida, 
could, could you give us some perspective how, how big the Florida market is on, on residential and kinda where, um, you know, your share is today? Oh, 
I believe our share is perhaps 20%. 
I don't believe it's too much. 
I mean, uh, the competition, there are many competitors and, uh, a couple of them are even today larger than us. So 
I believe there is a lot of upside that we could gain. 
Okay. Okay. That's good. And then, and then maybe on the margin side, just on, on raw materials, I, I know you've had some favorable hedges on aluminum. 
Um, h- how do you think of that kind of normalizing and, and maybe any, any impact there on gross margins into next year? 
I guess, you know, will you effectively be able to offset that with, with pricing and, and I guess same thing with glass? 
Yeah, so basically on, on the glass side, through our joint venture, we get stable pricing. So on, on the aluminum front is where you will have to kind of be mindful there. But with aluminum prices coming down, we don't foresee 
any impact on, on, on margins going forward. 
As, as we said, we see high thirties for the rest of the year. And into 2022, I don't, I don't expect that changing. Okay. Okay, great. Well, hop back in queue. Nice job 
guys. Thanks. Our next question comes from a line of Josh Wilson with Raymond James. 
Please proceed with your question. Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. 
Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Josh. Uh, could you give us a sense of what the multi max contribution was to single family in the quarter? 
Yeah, so basically right now, we're doing about 2 million per month on, on that. So it's, it's ramping up nicely. 
Um, still a lot of the, of the contribution was from the legacy products. 
Um, furthermore to that, we didn't want, uh, as I mentioned in the last call, 
we don't like to start, uh, doing too much of something, uh, because it's a new line for us 
and we like to make our mistakes small. 
So we now have a pretty good grip on how the line works, 
what the customers want, how they like to receive. 
And, uh, I believe that line is gonna keep increasing for next year. 
Got it. And you had some nice growth in the backlog. Was that pretty uniform throughout the US, or did you see pockets of strength and weakness regionally? 
Well, um, on the commercial side of outside of Florida, 
we saw a slow down for a year and a half. 
I mean, we weren't able to close as many jobs as we wanted to 
because, uh, cities like New York, Boston, uh, uh, Chicago, they lagged behind everything else. Uh, 
I mean behind Florida, for example, or behind Texas. 
But now in the last, uh, after we closed the quarter, we have seen, 
I mean, a lot of, uh, closing jobs and 
everything is speeding up, and we believe in this quarter, we're gonna have record, uh, 
closings, uh, in those areas. So we, we see it coming. 
We are very enthusiastic now about it. 
Good. And last one for me. Can you give us a sense of what the 2022 CapEx might look like? 
Yeah. So it's, it's gonna be a step down. Obviously we invested significantly in growth to be able to have the operational capacity to, to grow for the next couple of years. 
So my, my guess is that we'll be around kind of $10 to $15 million type CapEx next year. Got it. 
Thanks so much. Thanks, Josh. 
Our next question comes from line of Julio Romeros Sedori. Please proceed with your question. 
Hey, good more morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Morning, Julio. 
Hey, so what are you guys hearing from customers in, in Florida in regards to your service proposition and, and, you know, 
talk about how your lead times are trending compared to some of your competition in that area? 
Our lead times have been steady. 
I mean, we, we don't have that, uh, much constraint on, uh, materials and also our capacity. 
We foresaw that, 
uh, Uh, we are gonna have a lot of demand of the product, so we expanded before the upturn, 
that we have the capacity to keep shipping at, 
uh, six to eight weeks. We're doing really good. 
I mean, they're very happy. 
We do, um, very good service, uh, and our windows doesn't, they don't need that much service. 
That is one of the advantages that we have. 
Okay. Got it. And I guess for my follow up, um, you know, your balance sheet's looking very good. You're under one times leverage, you invested in some growth and, and you paid down some debt in the quarter. 
If you could just talk about, you know, how you think about your target leverage and, and maybe priorities for cash? 
Well, this is Christian. 
Um, we invested heavily, uh, the last couple of years, 
um, on increasing the capacity and, uh, on being a, uh, more efficient, uh, doing the products and it's paying off. 
Uh, that's why with the increased capacity that we're installing today, 
we're gonna be able to continue to grow in double digits. 
Uh, as a matter of fact, we, we are gonna try to be at least 20% bigger next year, 
uh, better next year. 
And, uh, 
with the investment that we have made, we have all the capacity, 
and obviously we are generating, uh, good cash. 
And, uh, so the, uh, leverage is, is very stable and coming down here, sometime. Yeah. 
So we're, we're down, we're below one time, Julio. I, 
I think our target, uh, when we started the year was two times. 
So obviously we're very comfortable, um, where we're at and have a lot of financial flexibility to, to undertake that, the growth that we're seeing. 
I think, um, for the foreseeable future, we'll continue investing in, in CapEx and growth and, and if we need to repay further debt, 
uh, that'll be another way to, to use cash. 
But, you know, at this point, we're definitely well below, um, our regional target. 
Okay. Very nice quarter and best of luck in Q4. Thank you. 
Our next question comes from line to Brent Deoming with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thank you. Congrats as well. Great quarter. Thanks. How are you, Brent? 
Um, yeah, thank you. Um, I, I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about 2022 or, or see what I can get from you guys. Um, uh, you know, 
I assume that you're gonna see a higher mix of installation as you convert some of this backlog, but your residential strength is unbelievable. 
And, and I guess I'm trying to think about the impact to, to margins as the residential business got into a base that's large enough to offset that, you know, mix impact you might see next year from installation? 
That's, that's correct. 
And that's how we're seeing. installation. That'sâ€¦ That's correct and that's how we're seeing it. Iâ€¦ I think both factors will offset each other so even if we have more installation, we think that we can maintain gross margins. 
Uh, furthermore on that, uh, subject, I want to clarify that we only do installation in Florida. 
We refrain from doing any installation in Texas or outside, that we were doing before. 
Soâ€¦ eh, since we're selling a lot now outside of Florida, without installation, 
even if the installation ramps up in Florida, with the increase selling outside of Florida, without installation, and the residential picking up 
and the commercial projects for mid-size are, I mean, running unbelievably highâ€¦ uh, 
I believe the margins are going to stay the same or even better perhaps. Okay. Yeah in thatâ€¦ 
I guess I wanted to ask you as well, I mean Iâ€¦ You seem to be navigating, 
you know, higher logistics environment very well Iâ€¦ I guess has the increase in onshore freight rates impacted your ability at all toâ€¦ to penetrate more of these, 
sort of inaudible markets, not the Southeast 
but maybe Midwest and elsewhere? Um, or has that uh, been negligible? 
Yeah, freightâ€¦ freight, uh, has been coming up, uh, lately. Umâ€¦ 
We have seen them increase like 30% of the uhâ€¦ or 40% in the rates. 
But um, a container takes, 
uh, between 40 to 80 thousand dollars of materials inside, 
so the freight is still, uh, a small amountâ€¦ 
um, like less than 5% ofâ€¦ 5% of cost of product and transportation. 
And we have passed the uhâ€¦ the umâ€¦ the cost over to customers. Um, unfortunately we have to do it 
and umâ€¦ and um we are trying to open new ways of shipping to Miami, 
um, through Cartagena, which is a much bigger port of inaudible to see if we can, uh, lower the cost of shipping. Okay. Um, uh, 
I guess maybe one more on MultiMax 
umâ€¦ just be interested in any 
of your milestones and successes you've had recently with new builders andâ€¦ and any targets or objectives you guys can share for that business, for the rest of this year, orâ€¦ or even 22 ' if you'reâ€¦ if you're willing? 
Well, all the builders uh, that we have been selling toâ€¦ we have like six accountsâ€¦ 
they're all happy with the product. The product performs much better than the competition. 
It's better looking. More modern style. 
And uh, it has uh, much better glass. It doesn't break as much 
or uhâ€¦ very negligently, in other case, 
and they are repeating and keep ordering and ordering and giving us umâ€¦ no uh, no inaudible that they're doing. 
I mean, I see that business increasing. 
Like I said before, we would like to go into a business and go like crazy and then don't know how it works 
and make big mistakes and lose clients. 
We started, we're doing good. They're happy. Weâ€¦ We uh, fixed a few things that they didn't likeâ€¦ 
uh, the way in which we shouldâ€¦ the lead timesâ€¦ 
and uh, the packing and now they're all happy and we are more happy than they are. 
Okay, maybe oneâ€¦ one more for me, just 
umâ€¦ it doesn't seem like you need to do MNA but is itâ€¦ is it something you're looking at? And what, whatâ€¦ what would that look like if you were? 
<laugh> Uh, to us mergers and acquisitions would make sense on buying a company 
that we don't have the knowhow. 
Ehâ€¦ and uh for now we have looked at many things and nothing is attractive enoughâ€¦ 
eh, for the momentâ€¦ eh, to even mention it orâ€¦ or to do anything in mergers and acquisitions. Weâ€¦ 
We believe we can develop the market and grow organically. It cost a lot less 
and uhâ€¦ look at our balance sheet. I mean, it speaks by itself. 
Absolutely. Well thank you for taking questions. Thanks 
Brian. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Regal with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. 
Thank you and also a great quarter here. 
Umâ€¦ coming back to the MultiMax product andâ€¦ and your other residential products, 
how many states are you now selling that product into and uh, how should we think about geographic growth in 2022 for that US residential 
inaudible? Well, actually we're now selling 
99% in Florida. We have sold uhâ€¦ like I said the last time, 
we are doing some tryouts in South Carolina, North Carolina 
and Texas. 
Umâ€¦ and they have been really successful. People are happy. We are learning 
and we plan toâ€¦ to step it up in uhâ€¦ especially from January on. 
This uhâ€¦ This coming quarter, I mean the quarter that we're in, 
we're going to keep doing a little business, learning the trade, how they like to be packed, how the like to receive. Get all the feedback 
and uhâ€¦ and finalize the development of a couple of problems that we were missing in those areas 
and for next year we expect 
those states to start buying uh, and increase the purchasing month by month. 
And then turn it over to US commercial business which was uhâ€¦ down in a third quarter. 
Uh, you obviously have very positive comments with regards to the backlog of that business and the reopening of that business 
so, how should we think about modeling the US commercial business in 2022? 
I suspect it's a little bit more, sort of, back end loaded in 2022, but uh, your comments would be helpful. 
Well in 2020 we wereâ€¦ we expected uh, a downturn for 2022 in the commercial, outside of Florida, 
because Florida is booming. 
And uh, we were expecting that, but now that there are a lot of closings, we believe that we're going to be 
par with this year 
and it looks inaudible a little bit. 
And 2023 
is going to look a lot better than 2022 or 2021. Very helpful. 
Thank you very much. You're welcome inaudible
