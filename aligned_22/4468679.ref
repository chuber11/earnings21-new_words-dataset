Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for waiting. 
I'm Margarita Chun from IR, and we would like to welcome everyone to Pampa Energia's Third Quarter 2021 Results Video Conference. 
We inform you that this event is being recorded. All participants will be in listen only mode during the presentation. 
After the company's remarks there will be a Q&A session. Questions can only be submitted in writing inaudible. 
Should any participant need assistance, please sent us a text message or email. 
Before proceeding, please read the disclaimer that is, that is located on the second page of our presentation. 
Let me mention that forward-looking statements are based on Pampa Energia's management beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to the company. 
They involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions because they are related to future events that may or may not occur. 
Investors should understand that, that general economic conditions and industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of Pampa 
Energia and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. 
Now I will turn the video conference over to Gustavo Mariani, our CFO. <silence> Sorry. 
Hello everybody and thank you for joining our conference call. 
Uh, in ca- in case, uh, you missed, you missed the news online… inaudible Sorry about… <laugh>. 
In case, uh, you missed, uh, the news 
Gabby Cohen, after sharing 18 years w- with us, decided to step down from his CFO position. 
Uh, fortunately, he will remain as a member of our Board of Directors. 
So, uh, we will continue taking advantage of his wisdom and, and, and expertise. Um, 
Gabby's well earned, uh, trust and respect from the investor community has allowed Pampa 
to, to become what the company that it is today. So, uh, our appreciation is tough to, 
uh, to, to say in a, in a few words. Um, 
Gabby, thank you very much for all you have done for the, for, for the company. 
Um, yesterday the Board of Directors accepted, uh, Gabby's resignation 
and, uh, appointed, uh, Nicolas Mindlin, who is sitting at my right as the, as our new, uh, CFO. Uh, 
Nico is an industrial engineer. 
Uh, he has been leading the M&A division of Pampa for eight years already. 
Uh, he has played a key role in the acquisition of Petrobras Argentina, a significant milestone for, for our company. 
And since then he has been focusing, a, among other things, in reorganizing the, the portfolio of assets, 
um, to focus in the core business that, that we have today. 
Uh, Nico, uh, together with Gabby's team, 
um, 
has all that is necessary to, uh, to succeed in, in his role. So we wish him, 
um, good luck in the, in his new endeavor. 
Nico? Thank you Gustavo for your support. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining. Uh, 
I'm very excited… Sorry. I'm very excited to, to begin this new chapter of my professional career in Pampa. 
I have been working in, uh, Pampa along with Gustavo, Gabby, and all of Pampa's team and partners for the last eight years. 
Uh, Gabby has done an excellent job in… on the financial front. 
He has put together an excellent team. 
So the idea is to continue on the same path. 
So now that travels and conferences are slowly resuming, uh, 
I can't wait to meet all of Pampa's investors in person soon. 
So now I will pass to Lida, uh, who will briefly comment on the quarter highlights, and then later we will open to the Q&A. 
Thank you Nico. Nico. Hello everyone. 
In the interest of time, I will summarize the latest events and financial figures. For more details, you can check our earnings release or feel free to contact us. 
On quarter's highlights, our E&P business achieved all-time high production of almost 330 million cubic feet per day in September as you can see in the graph. 
Also, we recorded the highest single day outputs at 350 million cubic feet per day, precisely on September 15. 
The recovery of demand, exports, and Plan Gas have been the main contributors for this growth. 
Moreover, this month, we participated in the first round of Plan 
Gas, a take-or-pay option to fill the remaining idle capacity at Neuquina Basin. 
The tender… we tendered and got awarded 71 million cubic feet per day, 2 / 3 of the total tender volume 
committed to deliver from May 2022 until December 2024 at three hund- three dollars… $3.35 per MBTU. 
Therefore, the following winter, we should be producing a new all-time high of 400 million cubic feet per day 
building an annual average price of $3.6 per million BTU. 
We highlight that Pampa is the only producer delivering the most significant gas increase compared to the winter of 2020. 
In power generation, we are moving on with, uh, 
PEPE Spanish, uh, PEPE III Wind Farm expansion project by doubling its capacity to reach a total of 106 megawatts. 
We assumed a roughly $80 million of investment that will allow us to keep increasing our clean energy portfolio 
and strengthening our position in the business-to-business market. 
In Q3, we achieved a substantial leverage reduction. Our net debt decreased by $125 million in a single quarter. 
Year-to-date we have accumulated $230 million of net leverage reduction. 
Finally, we just wanted to let you know that we released a 2020… our 2020 sustainability report 
audited for the first time. 
We show material improvements in water consumption, energy consumption, with carbon footprint intensities 
in line with the previous year's efforts to invest in efficient power technology and focus on gas. 
We seek transparency to share our EN… ESG performance with our stakeholders and your opinion is always welcome. 
Now let's move on to the quarter's financial KPIs. 
Revenues increased 49% year-on-year to $577 million in the quarter, 
mainly driven by Plan Gas boosted by the winter season, 
demand recovery, and commodities price hikes. 
All of them were partially offset by certain power plant outages and tariff fees in our utility business. 
In Q3, over 85% of our sales and EBITDA were dollar linked. 
The adjusted EBITDA amounted to $262 million, 
27% year-on-year due to, uh, the same reasons detailed before offset by higher E&P 
activity. Quarter-on-quarter, EBITDA increased by 9% mainly due to the seasonality and higher petchem volumes sold 
offset by increased raw material costs in petchem and outages at Energia Plus power units. 
Thanks to the strong investments and production growth, oil and gas is balancing back its EBITDA share for the first time in three years. 
CapEx almost doubled year-on-year 
in Q3 but, uh, remains similar quarter-on-quarter mainly 
because of the Plan Gas and Barragan expansion, offset by the commissioning of Genelba's second CCGT back in July 2020. 
Moving on to power generation as seen on slide seven. We posted an adjusted EBITDA of $126 million in Q3, slightly 
lower year-on-year mainly due to the outages that we said before and the end of Piquirenda's 10-year PPA, 
offset by higher B2B sales and higher thermal dispatch, especially at Loma. 
In the legacy units, the 29% PEPE swap that received last February was diluted by the inflation… 
devaluation. Quarter-on-quarter, EBITDA increased marginally due to the better B2B sales and seasonality offset by the retroactive spot price uptake. 
And spot energy is 59% of our capacity but only represented 24% of our power generation EBITDA which will keep shrinking unless recognition of prior adjustments keep up with the valuation. 
As these essential units to the grid continue being underpaid, it will be challenging to maintain them properly. 
However, recently, the government approved a price improvement for thermal legacy units, especially those with low load factor. 
Said improvement is temporary, payable between September and May, and linked with the electricity exports made by CAMMESA. 
Moving to Pampa's spot operating figures. Power generation in Q3 was 13% up year-on-year surpassing 
nationwide demand. 
We recorded higher CCGT dispatch at Loma and Genelba number one CCGT due to the better gas supply plus increased 
thermal dispatch with alternative fuels 
offset by the Plus unit's outages and low water import at Pichi Picun Leufu. 
Quarter-on-quarter the output rose 18% driven by seasonality but offset by the aforementioned outages. 
The power generation business model relies on capacity payments so the most important is to keep the availability as high as possible 
especially for PPAs. 
The availa- availability rate in Q3 reached 95%, slightly lower year-on-year mainly due to new units' and Energia Plus units' partial outages. 
Regarding our expansions, the closing to CCGT at Ensenada Barragan is more than 60% advanced. 
We continue working on the steam turbine, cooling tower, boilers and diverters. 
Also we are finishing the civil works and commissioning the high-voltage field. 
Around 1,700 people work in two shifts with all the COVID protocols in place to achieve the COD by sec- second quarter of 2022. 
Moving to the E&P, we posted an adjusted EBITDA of $104 million in Q3, 
a remarkable growth year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by 
Plan Gas, winter season, and demand recovery, offset by more royalties and resumption of activity. 
Our total lifting costs increased 36% year-on-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, explained by higher production output. 
However, lifting costs per unit stood at $6 per BOE, 11% more than last year but similar to Q2. 
This is mainly thanks to El Mangrullo's high productivity. 
Our global production increased 23% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter, 
again, mainly driven by Plan Gas, winter, and the local oil demand recovery to pre-pandemic levels. 
As a result, we averaged more than 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 92% is gas, is gas. 
On the oil side, which represented 23% of the segment's revenue in the quarter, 
volumes sold increased by 40% year-on-year and 31% quarter-on-quarter 
to 5,900 barrels per day 
mainly explained by the local demand offset by lower exports. 
And oil price, driven by the Brent was 50% increase compare-… driven by the events, was 50% increase compared to the last year, but remains seen quarter on quarter. 
Regarding gas, as shown in slide 10, 
our volumes still average, uh, 326 million cubic feet per day 
in the quarter, roughly 25% up, uh, read, year on year and quarter on quarter, from the recent inaudible before. 
Going back to our production performance, as I said before, we reached an all time high record in September. 
Again, the numbers show what the quarter's growth consummating close to 70% of our overall gas. 
This block is wholly owned and operated by us with outstanding productivity boasted by the increased capacity. 
Our learned average price of the quarter was $4.4 per unit used. 
76% up year to year and 14% increase quarter on quarter. 
Again, explaining the inaudible the peak 
is being sent spot prices out of the CSA, also selected the inaudible gas pricing levels. 
As you can see why below, the year to day sales are more diversified. 
Similar to the country's breakdown, 
gas retailers are also part of the supply in gas and they have priority in the winter, increasing their share to 39%. 
Also we are growing, as you can see, our B2B share. 
Regarding our EMP operations today, 
we strengthened our induction by recording $52 million 
during the quarter while it was marginal last year. 
This quarter we drilled eight times as well, also we completed 16 wells of which 15 are Tyke and one is Shell from foreign language 
A lot that which the maximum production rate of 28 cubic feet per day, becoming one of the most productive gas wells in foreign 
language Also as I said in the previous call, we are expanding the gas treatment plan among these so, reaching about 320 million cubic feet per day by the first half of next year. 
Now we drill 15 wells, and continue ten at foreign language 
Moving to the petrochemical business, we posted an account DVDA of $7 million in inaudible similar 
year on year, he higher 
raw material costs and inaudible compensated for the significant rise in commodity prices and industrial demand we covered. 
Quarter on quarter, DVDA halved, driven by higher raw material costs offset by increased sales of reforming products. 
The year on year and quarter on quarter to those sales volume increase was significant, especially with forming products. 
In addition of the quarter sales were exported. 
About cash and debt, so we are raising our CAPEX to accommodate more gas 
and we must highlight another quarter with solid cash flow position, generation. 
Driven by the outstanding operating performance from now our core businesses, and improved margins in the out 
streak. inaudible cash resulted in roughly $108 million. 
In comparison, last year's quarter represented $58 million stop flow due to the higher working capital. 
Notice that this quarter, working capital and others were positive, mostly swayed by improved collections from foreign language as shown in slide 13. 
Delays halved to 22 days compared to the maximum 46 days achieved in Q1 of this year. 
In addition we repaid a net of $50 million of principle debt and bought back shares for $3 million. 
So in total we generated $44 million of net cash, 
achieving $507 million of cash position by the end of the quarter. 
Moving on to slide 14, this slide shows consolidated figures including our affiliate ownership, 
but let's focus on the restricted group that reflects the bond parameters. 
As we began the call, our balance keeps trending despite the context. 
We continued to review the cross sales, 
having canceled most of the inaudible through the quarter for $55 million, posting $1.5 million 
as of September 2021. 
Almost 100% of that is eliminating dollars up from the 96% in June. 
The dollar debt bears an average interest rate of 7.8%. 
The average life we may see is 4.7 years. 
As said before, cash increase, 10% quarter on quarter to $507 million. 
Therefore, net debt decreased by $125 million to $917 million, 
a remarkable reduction just in a single quarter. 
Given the lower debt and higher VDA, the net ratio improved from 1.7 to 1.4 times quarter on quarter. 
In the next 12 months, the company faces less than $20 million of maturities. 
Therefore, we expect to keep trending our balance sheet. As a result, S&P upgraded our standalone rating to B- 
This concludes our presentation, and before we would like to open the Q&A session, Mary. 
Yes, thank you for waiting. 
The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please send it through the Zoom chat. We will read and answer them in the order they're received. 
Also please make sure your name and company are easily displayed to introduce you to the audience. 
Please lower your hand once your question is answered. Should any participant need assistance, send us a message or raise your hand. 
Please hold while we poll for questions. <silence> 
Our first question is from inaudible from Bank of America. 
How much additional upside do you see in that over the next few years? To what extent could this be held or limited by transportation capacity? 
inaudible thank you for joining us in the call. 
We believe that the 
transportation going out from the inaudible will be almost or completely full next winter. 
So as we have been saying, we talked about this in a previous conference call, 
it is crucial for the country to increase 
its infrastructure and transportation capacity from the foreign language to Buenos Aires and to the center of the country. 
We are going to be constantly working on that project. 
We hope it will be launched soon 
but we have no clarity on when that will happen. But definitely the country, in order to continue increasing the capital action and keep innovating, we 
need to build new infrastructure. 
And this makes a lot of sense for the country 
because to this new pipeline, 
the country will be replacing expensive imports that we do, 
gas from Bolivia, that costs a dollar from the local producers are 
receiving. 
We will import less energy which costs 
at least four or five times more expensive. And we are also importing during the winter 
and… inaudible meaning for 
all these imports, those that are scarce in the country. 
So regarding the additional lot size for a company like us, 
until this new pipeline 
is constructed, 
it could come from exports to Chile. 
And now that the transportation capacity out of foreign language is complete, it 
makes sense to allow the perm exports to Chile… 
not 
only on the summer months but throughout the year. 
That will be the next step of growth for the industry. 
So I'm not going into numbers because we haven't committed on the third round. 
Our growth on Winter of 2022, vis a vie, 
this winter will be roughly about 30%, 
so next winter we will be 11 million inaudible per day, starting in May. 
There is at least 8.5 million cubic meters of gas per day that we will deliver this winter. 
This winter we have been rounding up, starting at February and ending in September at 9.5. 
Originally, we were thinking that our production was going to slow down during the summer months, 
but thanks to 
the export of electricity that the country's doing to Brazil, 
we are able to maintain the production, 
so we currently are selling the same level that we sold during the winter 
and we are keeping a plateau of 9.3, 9.5 million cubic meters of gas per day. 
And we see this situation will stay throughout the summer and probably until next May when 
our production will jump again to 11 million. I think that… 
Thank you inaudible our next question comes from Jessica Hernandez from foreign 
language she says, Question is about, results were great on the oil and gas side, but listing costs have been increasing as of late. 
$6 per barrel, this is almost $1 per barrel versus one year ago. 
Is this related to the production run off? Perhaps costs there inaudible related to global supply chain. How should we think about this going forward? 
There is a second question but let's answer the first one. 
Hi this is Jen, how are you? 
So basically yes, it's an important piece in our production 
side, there's more fixed cost. And also we, this is the first year of the pipeline so, and that inaudible 

And then there's a lot of increases in salaries, in wages, so in real tens of dollars, it's an increase. 
And 
the second question is very related to the first one. 
Also, are you perceiving cost increases in rig and drilling equipment that you should be using-… free from breaks in drilling equipment that you should be using next year? Or are you already contracted for that? 
We, eh, he- air, we, we already contracted, and we've seen a slight increase in, in costs, but nothing out of normal. 
Thank you. Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Alejandra Aranda from foreign language. It's very related to the first question of Frank. 
Could you give us an update of what you're seeing the gas market and bottleneck to further develop the segment and timing of next plan gas inaudible 
round or further alternatives that you could explore to continue increasing volumes? 
Or should we view the 11 million inaudible meters per day on winter at inaudible for the near future? 
Could you share development costs? And what are your other costs are you using for a e- for new project? 
Well… Hmm. 
What? No. It's a, it's that, uh, we should be viewing… It depends. If we get, 
um, the, the new pipeline, the new main pipeline that, uh, the inaudible allowed to, to make it happen, 
we could see by 2023, 
I would say 2024, given the timing of, of building, what, uh, uh, a better and tighter winter production, 
uh, by 2024. 
You see, you saw in, in the presentation we expect to get the million 
by 2022, but, in order to increase from that, we are still link- depends 
on the expansion in the main pipeline. 
What do you think about that, Gustavo, about the bottleneck? 
Em… The, the reason why we were so aggressive in this go-around is difficult. We, we unders- Two 
things, but one is that we understand that, eh, until the, the new pipeline is working, 
eh, the gas market from inaudible will be very much constrained. 
That's why we wanted to be, eh, aggressive, eh, here. 
There's a good reason why we were very aggressive is because of the quality, eh, of our portfolio. 
Em, 
and the reason why we are so competitive and we have, eh, we're not comfortable giving, uh, higher inaudible for the, 
eh, and tell you that, 
um, 
that, uh, comfortable, eh, inaudible our expectation that, that we have. 
But our portfolio, 
eh, we are still able to continue developing shale and tight gases are, instead of in shale gas. 
Most of our, eh, colleagues in the industry, 
in order to, 
em, to maintain production or to growth, or to slightly growth this production has been going after, eh, or developing shale, shale gas. 
While we have the fortune of, eh, of having in our portfolio still, eh, good reserves of tight gas, 
eh, which are favorable in, in economic terms, because 
inaudible, eh, is 
at least cheap. Eh, that's why we have, we've been so aggressive. 
So going forward, after the growth that we were having 2022, eh, and until new, 
em, a new infrastructure is built, 
the only chance to continue growing, as I said, is to export, eh, to Chile, 
for increasing our market share of export to Chile. Eh, that is the, the situation. 
Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Constantino Poparias from Gwen Bay. 
Good morning and congratulations on the inaudible. Thank you. 
Could you share your expectations on the inaudible path by the inaudible of the 180 megawatt PPAs of foreign language? Hi, Constantino for 
you. 
So there's two PPAs at inaudible this year, one very small, eh, 
foreign language, in July of this year. And then, the big one, uh, foreign language. 
Combined for four more bases is, uh, 60 million dollars, uh, per year of decrease. 
So they will be billing around 50 million dollars per year inaudible, um, as we speak. inaudible Energy. 
Thank you, Liz. Our next question comes from Guiler Mileri from Morgan Stanley. 
I wanted to understand the current appetite, uh, for to advance a new amenity in Yempti. 
If the company could take advantage of the current market environment to expand the shale acreage at a more attractive valuation, even if shale gas inaudible is not a priority at 
this point. inaudible, could you repeat the question? Sorry. I wanted to understand the current appetite to advance a new amenity opportunity inaudible P, 
if the company could take advantage of the current market environment to expand its shale acreage at a more attractive valuation, 
even if shale gas exploration is not a priority at this point. Eh, um, 
I would say that we, we are very comfortable with the, 
the gas reserve in the portfolio on, on natural gas that, that we have. And we don't need to increase, 
eh, those reserves. 
Eh, it could be different on the, on the oil side. 
Eh, 
we, uh, are forward leaning in our history and continues to be. We are always, eh, searching for, for opportunities. 
Nothing has, 
nothing complete has, has materialized, eh, but we still looking for, for opportunities on the oil, oil side, 
em, 
oil, oil reserves, eh, in Argentina. 
Thank you, Glos. Uh, there is one question about MNA from Michael Shim. Uh, it's related to, to the last one. 
Uh, what opportunities to invest or acquire gas-related assets given the improving outlook? 
Is there probability of the new pipeline increasing, eh, based on support from an interest, from an interest of the IMF? 
Not inaudible, eh, the, the point of view inaudible I already answer. We are not looking… 
Doesn't make sense, eh, for us, eh, to increase our portfolio of, eh, natural gas. 
Em, not, not even if the, the, the pipeline is, eh, built and we can significantly increase our production. 
We, we have a, eh, we have reserves of excellent quality, em, probably the most, 
em 
competitive on the, of the inaudible innovation. 
So we, we don't see a need to, to increase our portfolio there. 
Em, regarding the IMF, I have no clue what the IMF, uh, eh, thinks about this, but 
I would say that, eh, it's so obvious that, eh, it will cut the, the macro of Argentina. 
Eh, eh, the cost of building this pipel- pipeline will be repaid, 
eh, almost immediately, probably in a year, a year and a half, two years. 
Obviously, it w- it will depend on what the ad- at what price, 
em, em, win- winter gas is sold in Argentina and what were this, the import parity that we will be replacing. 
But I'm sure, eh, 
and it, 
eh, within current, em, pricing gets repaid, eh, very, very quickly. 
So, uh, although I, I cannot tell you for sure, 
I will say that the, 
the, to anyone that analyzes the situation, it's, it's an obvious, it's very obvious that Argentina needs to, to do this pipeline. 
Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes… There was another question from inaudible Fernandez from Valens. 
inaudible question is related to 
the cash position. With the 
2022 cashflow of, uh, 
expected to be pretty good, 
what are you thinking about trash use- past uses regarding buy outs, the 2023 bonds, or possible investment during the next year? 
Eh, regarding our cash position, we have 
first will be increasing our, eh, investments within our, eh, our core businesses. 
So in order to, eh, increase our gas production by 30% n- n- next year, that, that it's a, a significant, eh, 
inaudible we will be doing. We will also, we hope to a- inaudible, 
eh, s- say that we, we are eager to expand our, eh, wind farm, eh, 
<unk> by… We are deciding between 60 to 80 megawatts of, eh, of capacity, 
eh, and started construction as soon as possible. 
Em, and, and regarding repurchase of our own, eh, 
assets, you know that we do that on our opportunistic, em, 
situations. So, eh, it, if there's 
an opportunity to repurchase our, our own debt 
or, eh, our own shares, we will probably go back to do that. 
We have been… We have not been doing so, eh, recently, because, because of the, 
eh, the price, the, 
because both our debt 
and our shares has, has been recently been going up. We, so we've, we've stopped repurchase of shares. And we haven't been repurchasing, 
eh, our own debt for, for a while. 
But we might resume that any time based on opportunity. 
Thank you, Gus. Our next question comes from Ann Mullins from Bank of America. She has two questions. 
The first one, you commented there was a temporary price increases for some thermal capacity between September and May 
and linked with exports by Conisa. 
Can you tell us more about this, please? And this is not only for thermal, it's also for hydro. 
Yeah, it was just, uh, published, um, um, a few days ago. And it's two things. 
Em, for the legacy capacity in, in power inaudible, 
eh, eh, machines that had a low dispatch, eh, were, were not collecting the full price of capacity. They were collecting, 
eh, if I'm inaudible, burned 70% of the, the full price of capacity, because of their low dispatch. 60, 
60% of the price of the capacity. 
Em… What they have, eh, eliminated this, uh, with action factor, so f- and they did on a, um, on a foreign 
language? They 
retracted, retracted since September. 
So, em, 
from September to, to May, this, eh, reduction in the price of capacity has, eh, 
disappear. That, in our case, helps our, eh, central foreign language in the north, and central, 
em, foreign language in the south of the inaudible Buenos Aires, which are steel turbine that have no, low dispatch. 
Eh-… inaudible that have low, low dispatch. Em… that roughly, to give you an idea, 
eh, has a $1.2 million per month of, uh, of additional, eh, 
revenues. And, the other news was this, eh, new… fund, eh, related to export of electricity to, 
to Brazil. And, 
em, as long as inaudible continues, eh, and we think that it will continue throughout all the, the summer and into, 
until next May, exporting electricity to Brazil, 
part of that profit is shared with the inaudible capacity. 
So, um, I think it's $10 per megawatt-hour, that 
is, that goes to this fund, and, uh, the fund is shared among the, uh, the units that have dispatched energy during, during that month. 
And for example, for us, in the mo- month of September, that- that was an additional $1.2 million of, of revenues. 
So in total, both this em, this two, this new, eh, these two new 
regulatory changes added, 
eh, in September, $2.5 million, eh, of revenues. 
Thank you, inaudible. Our second question from inaudible is, uh, 2022 outlook. 
Uh, let me mention that we don't give any vitals. Uh, we can give you, uh, what we have in production. 
The question is, what are your current CapEx forecasts for new e- for next year? 
How do you expect the power, and oil and gas markets to evolve next year, to the extent it is possible to provide any comment, comment, any commentary. 
inaudible. Hi, Anne, how are you? 
So, this year has been, uh, a very… 
uh, interesting year. Next year, we expect to maintain a little bit lower, 
uh, the, the EMP CapEx. The EMP this year is forecasted to end at around $200 million. 
The next year, it's uh, 
it's… will be close to that, but a little bit lower, because a lot has been done this year. That's the first year of plan inaudible. 
Power generation will remain very similar, uh, a little bit higher. 
This year was $40 million. Next year, we are expecting to do only 60 because inaudible. Uh, there's 
no expansions and this, and this is not including Bahrain. 
And that's, uh, that's uh, compare this year to inaudible it, uh, $250 million, 
more or less, of CapEx. And next year we are expecting something a little bit lower than that, or pretty similar. 
Thank you Elise. Our next question comes from Florencia Mashorda from MetLife. After interesting delibera- deliberating. 
What's next for inaudible, to you expect to keep leverage below one point five times on consistent basis? 
Okay, so, the answer will be no. And… inaudible will come for the below two 
point five eight. That's… is where our… some opportunities for investment in the upcoming year. Eh… inaudible to… quote-on- quote illegally. 
Thank you, Niko. Our next next question comes from Catalina Carnejo from CreditStreet. Uh, 
this is related to the legacy reveneration, in addition to the transi- transitionary, uh, inaudible we got, uh, this… this month. 
Uh, do we ha- do we have any updates for prices as inaudible for later, because electric generation? 
Any views on the generation this patch you can share for next quarter's inaudible situation in Latin America? And possible inaudible 
from inaudible. Eh… no, w- we are not envisioning a- a thing, where we inaudible views. Eh… 
regarding, 
eh… the generation of power capacity. We'll be all, until next… eh, February. 
That is… when eh… the- the next February… 
we should be getting the price adjustment of… the number this year, we got 89% increase. 
It was… slightly, eh- below 2020 inflation. 
Eh… within that, this February we will be collecting something similar to 2021, eh… inflation. But that's… what I… 
I think is most probable scenario, but… 
eh, it's personal expectation. That's no… guidance from… from the inaudible. 
Thank you, Gouss. Our next question, ah, is an additional question from Alexandra Hernanda from bang- uh, 
Itawoo. Follow-up, how much do you believe we could export to Chile, and what kind of prices are you getting? Eh, eh- 
We are currently exporting, eh… 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day to… Paragun. 
Eh… that's on a firm basis. And, then, eh… foreign language? How do you say foreign 
language, eh, em… Yeah, s- s- sport gas, we are selling around, eh… an additional… 
in average, and it change every… it changes every day, but at around half a million, eh… cubic meter of… of gas- additional gas. 
So… between… 
between 1.822 million cubic meters of natural gas per day is what we are currently selling to… to Chile. 
Eh… ex- expectation going forward, but, eh… it's not gonna- gonna happen until… em… 
probably… em… next spring in Argentina? Could be, to, to… double those- those exports. 
But, eh… eh, it's not something that would happo- would happen in the short term, that's… we are at full production capacity these days. 
And uh, uh… until m- May of next year, we- we are almost at… the full capacity of production. 
Thank you, Gouss. Uh, please hold while we poll for more questions. 
Our 
next question comes from… Liliana Yang, uh, from HECC. 
Could you please disclose inaudible plans for business recommends, if you mind that this is not a guidance, uh, this is the latest project that we have. 
Hi, how are you? 
So, um… because some people are seeing that n- decreased here to start, 
basically this year we are lending $250 million of CapEX to the inaudible group. 200 from… from the NP. 
Next year, um, we are… uh, estimating something a little bit lower than that. It's around 100 and… 80, 90? Not 
very… uh, different from this year. 
But, a little bit lower. 
Power generation for- a little bit higher this year was $40 million in payments… my payments CapEX. 
The number that we ended, called our extensions, to the inaudible group next year, 
there is some special payments CapEX that we have to do, so we will ramp up from 40 to 60. 
And then the rest is very small, just- just inaudible. 
So overall, ah, this year's 260, next year around 240, around those inaudible. Very similar, not over. 
Thank you Alita. Please hold while we poll for more questions. 
Our next question, and final one, is from Alon Somesa from foreign language. 
How do you feel about your current netback levels? Should we expect further deterioration of the listing call? 
No… we, we are not expecting, eh… further deterioration of the listing calls, and we are… comfortable 
that- shown by the aggressiveness, eh… in the last, eh, round of the… inaudible meeting. 
We are very comfortable with the netback levels that… that we have in, the natural gas business.
