At this point, it is my pleasure to invite the President Group CEO to give her remarks. 
So, good morning everyone. Uh, thank you, Abayomi for that introduction and welcome to everyone on the call. 
So my name is Owen Omogiafo, I'm the President Group Chief Executive of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, Transcorp. 
So, we really appreciate your joining us today, and the structure of the presentation, we'll spend about 30 to 35 minutes talking you through our presentation 
and we'll go into Q&A because we really want to hear from you. 
So, very quickly, we go into the overview of, um, of the market, what's going on, 
knowing about Transcorp. That would be slide five. If you have the slides with you, so slide five. 
Transcorp as you know is a listed company with approximately 300,000 shareholders, and we have a commanding presence in power, energy, and hospitality sectors. 
We continue to maintain an aggressive growth strategy on the pin by our core values of execution, enterprise, and excellent toward delivering our purpose of improving life and transforming Nigeria. 
Our investment philosophy is one that is geared toward delivering long-term shareholder returns, as well as social-economic impact 
through a solid corporate governance culture, 
high growth capacity, 
inaudible focus and operational efficiency, and of course, return on investment for everyone involved in the group. 
So at a glance, we have three pillars. 
We have the Transcorp Power, Transcorp Hotels, and the Transcorp OPL 281, which is our oil and gas business, 
and it's the owner and operator of OPL 281 block which has an estimated oil reserve of 187- 89 million barrel 
and a gas capacity of about 380 standard cubic feet. 
Transcorp Hotels is the proud owner of the pride of the nation, Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, which is a five star hotel, boasting 670 rooms, as well as 
world-class conferencing facilities, following the $100 million upgrade that was 
completed last year. 
Also the proud owner of Transcorp Hotel, Calabar, a three-star property, but that is the pride of that region, 
having a 132 rooms and the preferred destination for, um, for businesses and conferences in that region. 
In the meantime, we look to expand to Lagos being call, uh, to the nation. 
For Transcorp Power, we have an asset in Transcorp Power right now in Ughelli, 
which is called, uh, Transcorp Power Limited there. We have an installed capacity of 972 mega watts. It's a gas capacity, a gas-fired plant. 
But in the long term, our vision is to achieve about 25% of the ge- power generated in Nigeria. So that is the group at a glance. 
Going further, I'll just quickly run through some of the milestone. You are familiar with these milestones, but sometimes it's good to highlight it. We'll talk about it again 
so we keep on, we keep in mind our, uh, critical milestone. 
Our dear company Transcorp was incorporated in 2004. 
It was lifted in 2006 on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. 
In 2011 Heirs Holdings became a core investor. So that was the phase one of our journey. 
Then our phase two of our journey which runs with a timeline of 2012 to 2018, 
our hurry into the power business started that period, where we emerged, Transcorp Power, Ughelli emerged as the preferred bidder for Ughelli Power Plant. 
And following the successful agree- um, execution of that, of that bid, 
we went further to do a merger of Transcorp, Transcorp Ughelli Power Plant Limited and Ughelli 
Power Plant and then emerged the company that today you know as Transcorp Power Limited that is led by Chris Ezeafulukwe as the managing director. 
In the hospitality business, 
in hospitality business, we executed successfully the management agreement that extended our play in, uh, hospitality in Nigeria. 
And we acquired additional land for our Hilton Ikoyi property. So that shows our growth in hospitality. 
We also… In that period, Transcorp Hotels was also listed on the Nigerian Stock Market. It was listed in, uh… 
It was listed on Nigerian Stock Market, giving us the position of being, of having a listed company within Transcorp. 
Similarly, we im- we achieved the listing of our bond in that period. 
Now we're at the phase 3, which is our 2019 to 2025, uh, strategy. 
In this period, uh, we're in 2020 now, we've also achieved some milestones in there. 
We've recently emerged as the preferred bidder for Afam. 
And with that bid, emerging as preferred bidder, we are going closer towards our medium strategy of generating 25% of power in Nigeria. 
Meaning that we're gonna be responsibility for one in four Nigerian's having electricity. 
We've also been admitted as member into the West African Power Food, which has been very significant. 
And we shall continue to explore opportunity investments in this power sector through renewable energy and inaudible solutions powered in critical to the, uh, transformation of Africa. 
For our hospitality sector, 
notable to mention that last year, we got… We're issue the Certificate of Discharge by the 
National Council of Privatization on the purchase of the, um, Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. We'll continue to sweat our existing asset, as well as expand into new businesses and locations by pursuing 
various strategies. 
For the oil and gas, we'll commence production of oil and gas in OPL 281 and acquire new asset as required. 
So just… This talks about, this slide is showcasing our leadership. It's here for your information, 
the CEOs on, on the call with us, so inaudible you know, and you see other key executives, um, that are part of the group as well. 
So looking at the operating environment, there's a big thing going on now, it's really about the COVID. 
The COVID-19 has been the greatest impact right now, even though there are other things that are affecting. 
As at date, we had… It is said that about 5 million people are infected by the, uh, by the virus, with sadly 300,000 deaths recorded. 
On the other hand, we are also having significant figures in terms of recovery. 
Then the lockdown across which has affected various, um, businesses. Note, note… Worthy to note that 
the global economy is predicted to lose roughly $2.7 trillion as a result of this pandemic. 
IATA has particularly estimated that the tourism would lose about 252 billion out of that, um, two hun- $2.7 million. 
Another critical thing that has happened that's affecting 
Nigeria is a drop in the oil, in the cor- uh, global commodity prices, with oil prices crashing and a inaudible trade at, um, inaudible in the next inaudible 
in that period. 
Now bringing it home to us Nigeria, what does this mean for us? That would be slide 12. Bringing it home for us in Nigeria. Our cases are ranking up. 
As at the date of the presentation, we had 5000 cases, but today, our cases are well over 8000. 
The stock exchange is repeated to have lost about 2.5, um, trillion. 
But it's not all, uh… 
We've also had im- uh, economic stimulus measures, both on the physical and the monetary side, with intervention funds put in place for the, 
uh, for the crisis intervention funds put in place 
and the different things put in place, as it relates to creating respite to businesses at this time so that there is survival for the economy. 
One of our businesses has also been a beneficiary of the moratorium that was put in place, the three-months repayment moratorium put in place for, on the Federal Government Funded 
Lon- Loans. Now as a group within, we've been very responsive, we've been, we've been proactive in our response to the coronavirus pan- pandemic happening known as COVID-19. 
Transcorp Power is an essential business, 
but inaudible essential business and us remaining open throughout that period, we've put in a lot of plant to ensure that our staff were able to generate power 
under the safest con- conditions possible. 
In the hospitality sector as well, we very quickly put in measures in place for the sanitizers, to the thermometer and co. When the CEOs speak, they will send, they will talk a bit more about that. 
But as a group, we've deployed our robust technology, infrastructure, and our modern style of working that we already had in place, 
and we transmitted into a work from home very quickly, very early and we continued. 
Notable to mention that we successfully held our annual general meeting online. I wanna inaudible participated in it. 
It was actually the first, uh, from, on this. 
So, moving on quickly, we just have some macro indicators here that is just for you to note. 
We won't spend too much time, we won't spend too much time on it. It's just for us to know the indices that are going on here. 
And now, at this point, I'll take a pause and invite the group CFO, 
Mr. Mutiu Bakare to take us through the group financial performance during this, uh, Q1. Thank you. 
Thank you very much, Owen, and, uh, good afternoon, everyone. The financial highlight is on page 16 of the presentation. 
If you look at the page, the revenue for the period under review was 15.3 billion. 
And when compared to 18.3 billion in Q1 2019, there is a reduction of about 16% in revenue. 
The reduction in revenue is mostly due to the reduction in revenue from our power business. 
So there are a lot of things that are happening in the power business that we are going to talk about when we get to the segment. 
So, but majorly, the reduction in the revenue for the group is because of the reduction in the revenue from the power business. 
The gross profit for Q1, 2020 was 7.3 billion, 
as against 8.1 billion in Q1, 2019. 
This represent a decline of 10% in gross profit. And this is because of the reduction in revenue mentioned earlier. 
The group end the period with a profit before tax of 1.7 million, as against 2.5 billion posted in Q1 2019. 
For the financial position, 
the total asset decline slightly from 313 billion at the end of 2019 
to 311 billion at the end of Q1, 2020. 
This was largely because of the incidental decline in trade and other receivable, 
and this is because we receive a lot of money towards to our receivable during the period under review. 
In the same… In the total liabilities for the period, reduced from 204 billion 
in 2019 to 203 billion as at the end of Q1 2020. 
And this is because of the payments that are equally made towards our outstanding liabilities. 
The shareholders fund reduced s- slightly from 108 billion at the end of 2019 to 107 billion in Q1, 2020. 
And, uh, the reason for this is because of the impact o- of the loss on the traded equities. 
And this is, this is treated as other comprehensive income, that is why it is impacting the shareholders fund. 
If you go to slide 17, so this basically shows the breakdown of our revenue between the segment. 
So, and, as you can see from the, from the s- from the slide, the power contributes more than 70% of the group revenue. 
And this explains why the performance of power actually impact the overall group performance 
because the segment contributes more than 70% of our revenue. 
And if we look at the slide, the revenue contribution from power declined from 77% in Q1, 2019 
to 73% in Q1, 2020. 
This is ba- ma- basically because of the challenges we faced in our, in our power section, relating to the issue of gas supply, as well as transmission infrastructure. 
So when we get to power segment, we'll talk more about this. 
Transcorp Hotels inaudible increase from 23% in Q1, 2019 to 27% in Q1, 2020. 
At this point, I will hand over to Chris to take us through what happened in power and what we're doing to manage the situation. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mutiu. Um, you've already provided the numbers, so I'll, I'll go ahead to, 
um, explain. As you can see on page 19, 
basically, this, this, um, this page actually speaks to again, some macro, some fact, um, relating to power generation. On the left side, 
you can see that, um, the gas tunnel plant still have, um, a chunk of contribution to our electricity generation mix in the country. 
On the next, um, page, we'll see, um, a summary of the challenges we've had to deal with. 
Um, inadequate gas supply already spoken about, 
um, the low load offtake, which, um, has to do with transmission challenges, and of course, the fact that, um, the distribution companies, in terms of infrastructural capacity are not able to take as much load as, um, the GENCOS are able to come up with, including us. From the Gencles are able to come up with, including us. 
The entire shot fall has, um, also continued to also result in the poor remittances by the discourse 
and of course the summary of all this, as you number four, is the liquidity crunch, which we have continued to deal with. 
Um, however, when we look at page 21, um, there are some key improvements that have happened. 
Uh, in terms of payments there has been improvement by, uh, Embed. 
So, um, we have received additional payments from Embed, 
which, um, has kind of helped in alleviating, um, our situation, uh, or rather, improving our situation. 
Increased generation capacity also, 
um, because there are quite some number of turbines that have returned to service across, uh, Gencles. Then there's, um, positive attitude of government, 
um, towards resolving the power sector issue 
and, um, one of the developments around this is the setting up of the power sector refrom working group, 
which is headed by the vice president, into which the inaudible committee, um, 
is al- has also reported. 
And so, um, the next point is the performance improvement plan, 
which, um, the regulator has continued to use to, um, request, uh, performance improvement from the distribution companies. 
Then, uh, when we move on, we'll see that the gas supply, um, already spoken to, again. 
Uh, the summary of the challenges we had, the good news is that all those challenges were actually resolved. 
And so, uh, toward the end of the first quarter, 
we experienced increased gas supply, which also informed, um, the increased generation we started experiencing from, uh, the end of, uh, first quarter, compared to 
what has been, uh, since, um, last quarter of last year. 
In terms of way forward, 
right? We, um, we had activated our gas supplier agreement, 
with our gas, um, suppliers, MPDC, and ND Western JV. 
Uh, prior to that activation, we got gas on best endeavor, because of the industry challenge that we have had in the past sector. So successor Gencles, um, had 
not been able to 
activate their gas supplies… their gas supply agreements, 
but we eventually did that. 
And what that has done in terms of significance is that, um, from best endeavor arraignment, we now have 
contractor obligation on the part of our gas suppliers, to provide us 124 million SCUF of gas per day 
and, um, this will continue to result in increased generation. 
We're equally making additional, 
um, um, efforts to get addi- additional dust supply, um, to our plant, knowing fully where that at the end of the year, 
our available capacity would improve, will increase. 
Um, transmission. We only had one grip collapse. 
And in terms of way forward, 
we'll continue to monitor development. We are glad, um, about the movement that is taking place around the Siemens agreement 
and, um, the Siemens deal that the federal government entered into, 
which is supposed to lead to increase infrastructure capacity, in terms of distribution and transmission. 
Where for… on commercial matters, that's on, uh, page 24, 
um, we still have our standing receivables, no doubt about that, even though with increased the, uh, um, payment. 
And so, however, with the payment assurance plan, which was extended by the 600 billion that was made available to Embed by federal government, we are short of continued payment, just like the last site we received. 
Uh, with respect to the legacy debt, 
um, we are also engaging government and, um, governmental agencies in the power sector, um, to find solutions to that. 
The financials are on page 25. Uh, the CFO had already spoken to them, um, at large, so, um, basically the figures are there showing, 
um, the, the changes and the differences in terms of performance, 
when you compare Q1 to… Q1 2019 and Q1 2020. 
Um, in summary, uh, it's been… um, we took some hits as you would see there, as I been explained, however, 
we also were able to 
decline our operating expenses, um, by 8% and this was due to, um, some strategic, 
uh, um… uh, some strategies that were adopted by management to ensure that, um, certain repairs and maintenances, we are not outsourced, 
but, um, we utilized the skills we had in-house to be able to fix them. 
The next, uh, slide, basically, is a graphic representation of our capacity utilization, 
um, compared to gas we consumed. That's the upper side and on the lower side, it's, 
um, our available generat- uh, our valuable capacity, um, compared to generated capacity, in terms of mega watts. 
So that's the summary of the story for the power 
and, um, at this point ill hand over to Dugbe to also make the presentation on hospitality. Thank you. 
<silence> Dugbe you need to unmute your mic please. Okay. Apologies about that. Thank you very much, Chris and good afternoon again, everyone. Um, 
I would like to just take you through the overview of the hospitality, um, sector and as how… and as it has affected us. 
The contribution of the hospitality sector continues to be quite in Nigeria and indeed across the world. 
Um, in terms of const- contribution to our real GDP, 
we had about 638 billion as of twe- 2019. 
The sector continues to be a key significant contributor, in terms of even recruitment and employee o- as a significant employer of labor. 
We reported real annual growth of about 2.85% for the sector in 2- 2019. 
Um, so passing the 2018 figures of one po- 1.09%. 
Um, with the onset, as the group CEO talked about the impact of COVID on our business as a, as a, as a whole, 
um, the hospitality sector has actually, um, had a significant impact of the, of the, um, COVID pandemic, 
um, that we would actually, won't say it's not fully predictable, how the impact will be on both our revenue and our supply chains. 
Uh, it's significantly affected our cash flow, um, and we've had constraints restriction of mobility and virtual business operations has actually affected us as well. 
We have also with there a sharp drop in our occupancy rate across the hotel 
and across the industry, it speculated at up to 75 million jobs at risk within this sector. 
We also have seen that about 2.1% in increase of global unemployment directly linked to travel 
and tourism job losses. 
However… Um, I mean the, the, the news is not all inaudible. As, as the, at the hotel, one of the key fe- measures that we took and… put in place at the, uh, onset of the pandemic, 
was that we ensured that all of our staff were properly trained and equipped. All of our guests were also kept safe and ensured that they actually knew all that they needed to do onsite. 
Around the hotel, we had sanitizers temperature checks, preventive measures, and awareness on all of our screens. 
The rooms were more thoroughly claims than ever before 
and we ensured that we also communicated very effectively with our customers, to ensure that we… the confidence that they knew that we had put in the hotel. 
Further, our, our key strategies, really, going forward, is, we've put in place our cost measures to ensure that even within this time 
operational cost savings is a key priority to us. 
And we have gone ahead to receive concessions from our contractual services. 
We have also very f- ve- very f- very focused on reducing cost across the hotels generally. 
Um, making very simple changes, in terms of saving energy, to reduce our energy consumption, 
using significant… using fewer chillers across the hotel, fewer elevators across the hotel to just ensure that we can keep our costs down. 
Going forward, we remain optimistic and very focused about what we put in place, to ensure we can recover from the heat of this COVI- COVID, um, pandemic. 
We have split our initiatives into two phases. The first phase is going to focus very actively on recovery. 
And what we will do is actually to, to… i- in terms of recovering from the loss of the long shut 
down, we are going to continue to sweat our existing assets through operational efficiencies 
and develop a local demand market, particularly targeted at the leisure segment 
and providing entertainment and activities across the industry for us in, in, in the two locations of Abuja and Calabar. 
Immediately, one of the thing… key things that we did was introduction of our takeaway service business and this is already gaining a lot of significant traction, 
serving fast food and oriental cui- cuisine across our market. 
We also kicked up delivery and pick up service for our laundry business. 
And we've also put innovative events in place, such as the drive-in cinema and concert, 
that adhere to very strict social distancing guidelines and while keeping the hotel, um, in mind and generating revenue at the same time. 
We are continuing to deepen other services across our outdoor catering services 
and put in place, again, communicating, topnotch safety guidelines, 
um, to re- restore confidence to our g- our guests and be able to welcome them back once they back… once the lockdown is finally lifted. 
In addition, we continue to take precautionary measures to keep all our employees and guests safe. 
And with the heating, uh, ins- institutionalizing, a clean stay with lifestyle of protection, we'll be… which will be introducing across the hotel, 
just to ensure that guests know the amount of clean- cleansing that has gone on, to keep them sanitized and safe at the hotel. 
We will continue to create, um, innovative ways to communicate with our guests within all of this period as well. 
In the, in our growth strategy phase, obviously, we're going to focus, like I mentioned, on our leisure market on, on, on our local demand as well. 
We are continuing to push promotions and incentives to gain traction for business, targeting international business 
and airline crews, as the reopening of the airways and flight resu- resume. 
Also, we are looking to continue to attract more conferencing events across Africa, for events that have taken place, to attract them to Nigeria as a location Calabar and Abuja, 
our key locations for that. 
If we quickly go to the, um, page on our key performance indexes, 
we would see that, um, our occupancy has actually declined quite significantly from 74% in February to about 35% in March 
for the, for, um… compared to the industry as a whole, as a whole. 
Our ADL was ₦83,604, at the end of March, whilst the industry recorded ₦64,629 in March, 2020. 
Our RevPAR recorded a sharp decline from 61,562 in February to about 29,553 in March, 20, 
while the industry recorded the decline of… from 46,519 to 24,695. 
Looking at our financial highlight, um, which you, you know, talked about that and, and in detail, so I won't go through it too much, 
but I think just note, note to mention is that our revenue dropped slightly by 0.3% 
and, um, we've, uh, we actually reported a loss of about 687 million in quarter t- quarter one, 2020. 
Um, we, we also, in terms… One of the reasons for the major loss that we had was 
i- in terms the interest cost that is now been expensed as a result of completion of the upgrade, as against our Q1 2019, 
where the upgrade was still going on and capitalization of interest was still on. 
The impact of COVID will truly be seen in quarter 2, 2020. 
However, we're quite confident that some of the initiatives that we are putting in place, would help us, um, reduce the negative impact that one would have expected within this industry. 
Finally, we are hopeful and optimistic that business and activities will return to the hotel and hospitality sector in due course. Thank you very much. 
Thank you very much, Dugbe, for that detailed overview. 
So let's just move on to oil and gas. I'm quite conscious of time. I want us to beef time for, um, engaging Q and A. 
So if we can just go to slide twenty- 35, please. Let's just go to slide 35, 
where we just briefly look at the challenges into the oil… affecting the oil sector in Nigeria. We're very conversant with this, 
the delay in the PIB, uh, insurgency pipeline vandalization, infrastructural deficit, and the price fluctuations, and the PMs price regulation. 
These are, these are challenges that we're well conversant with, so we'll not spend too more time on it, 
but to draw your attention to slide 36, which is what is critical, in particular. 
So despite the challenges, these are the timelines that we're looking at, and as you can see, we've continued to stick with it. 
So we'll start by looking at partnership. So 2018 to 2020 focus on partnership, 
specifically identification of competent and technical financial partners to jointly develop the asset that we inaudible. 
Going on from there into drilling, 
looking to drill the site by next year, so site survey, local preparation. Very strong to this set… this segment is the community engagement, cause those… that's really important, ensuring that the communities are well engaged… the community in which the assets is situated, well engaged. 
From drilling will go into production. Under the production state, which is, again, that 2021 to 2022 production and expansion 
we'll be looking at drilling the second world, completing all the work program obligations as agreed with the, with, uh, inaudible and all of them. 
Then moving into expansion. 
Most critical in the expansion phase is the conversion of inaudible from an OPL license to an OML. 
So that is on the oil and gas, um, looking at the outlook. 
So my… both Dugbe and Chris, when they spoke, had touched a bit on the outlook, but lemme just bring it a bit, um, closer. 
So for Q1, we had, um… Q1 2020, our actual for power, 
we had an average capacity of about 462MW for power. 
Our target for Q2, this is May, almost ending of may, our target is 538MW, which we've… we, we are on track for. 
Uh, average cap- average generated capacity for power in Q1, which of course we saw, um, impacted our performance, Q1, was 256MW on average. 
Our Q2 target is 407MW, following the measures that we have put in place, 
to address the challenges that we saw in Q1, which Chris, um, highlighted quite strongly, so I won't go into that. For hospitality, 
as we all know, hospitality, the sector has been really by COVID and the hotels are shut down. 
So a lot of hotels are recognizing occupancy of zero or rather recognize zero for the… 
for Q2, but our target is that would achieve 11- For Q2, then our target is that we would achieve 11%, 
which will really be around the June side. 
But looking at things like the airports being reopened, driving local, uh, local patronage and other measures that inaudible had touched on. 
Our ADR would have a bit of a dip from 80,000 to 78,000, 
rent per room will go down to 9,000 naira because it is driven by the occupancy as well. 
But just to look the growth in power that will have average generated capacity of 407 megawats. 
Still on the outlook, 
still on the outlook, we will focus very strongly to close the Afam acquisition. It's still under negotiation having the conversations. 
I just want to retaliate again, the reason for getting into Afam app and it 
still remains a strategic fit for us. We are committed to generating 25% of Nigerian's power. 
One in four Nigerians, will get power from Transcorp group that is our vision, and we remain committed to that. And acquiring Afam takes us closer to that. 
That availability is very strong in that region. There sufficient, uh, evacuation capacity. 
We also, it takes us closer towards our eligible customer opportunity. And of course the cost efficient capacity recovery that we shall be delivering. 
Afam has an install capacity over 906 megawat, and that is what we are going 
adding the 966 to our 972 megawats in Ughelli that would take us to near, take us 
to over 2000 megawats install capacity. 
Now, if you look at the timeline we had presented this before to you, in terms of the timeline for closing the Afam deal, 
whilst we've had delays because of the COVID 19 
pandemic, the previous has been used very wisely. We've been having various discussions with the PPE working with advisors and to the parties to the deal. 
Uh, once we signed the SBA, we shall go on to do a 25 percent 
payment and we are strongly exploring the possibility of early take 
over, which would mean that we're immediately able to recognize income from that business whilst we are going ahead with the payment. 
So that it on Afam and our outlook. So to retaliate, we're looking at increased performance from power. 
Now whilst we start a cautious, but a cautious but sustainable recovery 
because Transcorp using Abuja, Transcorp inaudible they remain the preferred destination in their regions. 
And the innovative products that have also been come up, have come up in the hotel. That means we've been seeing it, the innovation of the drive through concert, drive through cinema. These are things that we're going continue, and 
that will put us very strongly on the map as the Nigerians prefer, as Africa's preferred hospitality brand. 
Now we look at our CSR and awards. 
So we've… during this COVID period Transcorp power limited, again, part of our community engagement supported the community and gave, 
um, gave items, released items towards COVID that 
a total of 1,308 families benefited from this intervention. 
We've also supported with medical equipment as well to ensure that we can continue to, uh, provide a safe environment for our workforce. 
Now, whilst COVID is the great topic we're all talking about today. It's also important that we continue to drive our CSR strategy in other areas as well. 
Cancer remains one of the top, uh, killers, and we've been working to build awareness about cancer. 
So at Transcorp Hilton Abuja, we have the walk and run against cancer in Q1, in partnership with project Think Blue. Okay. 
We've also continued to protect the environment, very, very critical, our renewables and recyclable, 
um, initiatives will continue to drive it. 
Education remains very critical. So in Abuja, we partner with, with an NGO to build new blocks of classroom for children of the inaudible community in Abuja, 
it was very, very well received because we renovated 
these children's classrooms, built new ones. 
So that able to learn in an enabling environment. 
Women and gender inclusion remains a very strong focus for us as a group. And part of what we do in driving that inclusion in our group, 
we did, we continue to drive our women empowerments initiative through the business empowerment program, 
where we take women and train them, give them the equipment they need to set up businesses in sewing and training opportunities. In that way they become 
financially and economically included. 
We've graduated in 50 batch of this, of this program and we continue to drive it. 
Now all of these have record, registered us from awards, which we will see. I mean, the awards are here for your information 
just to show. So awards show that what you are doing is not in vain, people are recognizing it, and they continue to give us that testament. 
We continue to win awards internationally, locally, and really, really strong awards. 
Last year, Transcorp hotels was awarded the national productivity award under the category of productivity and innovation. This was in 2019. 
We also retain our standard of excellence under the award travel award and the SevenStar luxury hospitality and lifestyle. 
We are recognized by, uh, Chelsea as well for the pre-do excellence award awarded to Transcorp inaudible for the best hotel. 
This, I will give this award in relation to the renovation and upgrade of that property that we did. 
So just to say, um, 2019 was good, 2020 we started out the Q1. 
We're very hopeful for taking the year to the end, with the implement we've seen in the past sector and the recovery that will definitely come to the hospitality sector as the economy is cautiously reopened for business this. 
So at this point, I'd like to take a pause here. I hand this over back to Abayomi to take questions, please. Thank you for listening. 
Thank you very much, Owen. Um, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, we will just take your questions. 
So if you have a question, please indicate by clicking the hundred icon at the bottom right of the participant list. 
So there's a hundred icon just at the bottom right of the participant list. So if you, if you have a question, please click the hundreds button. 
I think they can also type in the chat box as well. Then we'll read it out, please. 
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we would like to take your questions. 
If you have a question, please indicate by click the hundreds icon at the bottom right of the participant list 
or use the chat box. 
Or we will take it that… Okay. We, if we take it, that will have a lot of, it was well presented. 
Um, good afternoon. Um, well done for the presentation. So I have, um, a couple of questions about four of them. 
So, um, during the presentation, um, you mentioned about, 
um, inaudible 600 billion, pay 600 billion payment or something. So 
I just want find out, I just want understand the duration or how long the payments plan will last. 
So I, I, I note that, um, something like this was, um, approved sometime in 2017, that lasted to 2018. 
So I just want to just want to understand how long that will last. 
That's the first question. And then the second question 
is that, um, in your outlook you said, um, you to target the capacity utilization, but by my estimate, it's about 75%. 
And so I'm just, um, curious over the last four quarters, 
not just year one and one, one over the last four quarters, the capacity utilization has been between, um, 40 to 50%, 40 to 
60% there about, and I'm just wondering, um, what to drive this significantly. 
Yes, I know some effort have been put in place, um, just for us around how, 
um, how we see very significantly that, that maybe you could inaudible around that. 
And then, um, my next question is about, um, the Afam acquisition. Okay. 
So I saw the timeline of, um, transaction and I saw where you said the 25% payment and then later 75%. So 
I just wanna find out, I just want to know more about how the group intends to finance 
it. 
What's the capital, capital structure going to be like, especially considering the current levels of, uh, getting the companies or in the inaudible group. 
And, um, okay. So my next question is, 
um, on the oil and gas sector. Okay. So yes, I understand that it's a very critical sector in the economy. 
However, in light of current development, we, we saw what happened in the, um, global market, the 
issue with prices and 
all. So I, I don't know, um, maybe, uh, I don't know what the company or what the group is seeing in that space, 
but maybe you could try to give more insight as to why the group thinks that's exploring or venturing into that space 
would result into generation of the returns have to be high enough to cover 
the invested capital. 
Um, those are my questions. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. Daniel. Daniel, do you mind telling us the organization that you represent please? No, not Daniel, Abdulrauf. 
Pardon? Abdulrauf, my name is Abdulrauf Bello. Oh. Yes. 
I'm a research analyst at, I'm a research analyst at WSTC 
financial services. Okay. Thank you very much. Very good questions Abdulrauf. Thank you. 
So, uh, we'll take the… Abayomi uh, do you want me to answer now? I wanna take more questions first. I think we should answer now. Okay. We should answer. Right. Okay. 
So I would address some of the questions and I will invite Chris inaudible, who should also, um, address. 
Let me just start with the last one on oil and gas. You're right, what you've said in terms of the sector right now, 
but we are also aware of this up and down and the sector and that oil and gas remains a very attractive sector, not withstanding. 
As you know, the liquidity that comes in from there, the, uh, foreign exchange, the forex that you get from that region as well. 
And the huge resources that we have in our country in oil and gas, 
but as a very cautious company, we will take every decision that we make towards the continuation of our invest- of our investment and this sector 
will be driven by strong numbers. 
Okay. Will be driven by figures data. What we are looking at is to make sure that any, uh, investments we make at the return on equity will be sensible. 
We're not just gonna dive, dive in there, just because we already have the asset. 
It's gonna be something that is very, very meticulously deliberate upon, and the decisions made. 
But to add that our oil and gas, so the key thing it's called oil and gas, it's not just oil. There is, we have, um, gas in there. 
You've had us talk about the challenges regards in our country as which we need for getting the power that we need. 
So the gas reserves that we have in that asset would also be very, very useful to our power play. 
So that's also the reason for continuing to explore in there. 
Now on the outlook, 
on the outlook you've asked about why we are thinking at 75% keeping in mind that in the last quarter, four quarters 
it's really been around 40 to 50%. 
So in the presentation, and again, with what Chris said, 
there were some challenges that we had, 
but we've addressed quite a bit of it in particular, not worthy to mention the signing of our gas supply agreement, 
which has gone the long way in improving our gas supply, taking out on a best effort basis to a contracted capacity basis. 
And we are exploring more discussions of getting additional gas supply. 
Chris, we talked more about that. 
So for Afam, we are exploring a combination of, of, uh, um, optimal funding structure. 
Like you already noted debts, debts that we carry in the group, but we're looking at the combination of equity and debt to fund it. 
So at this point, I will invite Chris to talk a bit more about the power business as it relates to the reason where we can bank on 75% performance 
and to touch on the embed. 
When Chris is done, when Chris is done with you, you can just talk very briefly on the Afam acquisition, the funding thereof. 
Thank you again, Abdulrauf. Chris over to you. 
So thank Owen. Um, thank you for those insights just to provide additional insight also. Abdulraman, thank you for your questions. 
Um, with regards to capacity utilization, yes. gas, gas, gas, um. 
It's all about gas for us as a gas fire plant. And so we have had major challenge with gas, 
but, um, um, you know, like I said, when I presented, when I made the presentation, 
we have been able to, you know, wrap our heads around some of those challenges 
and, um, resolved some of them with partnered, in partnership with some key stakeholders like the Nigerian gas company. 
Um, so 
it's the benefit and impact of that that has left led to the capacity utilization that, um, we're talking about, and that's why we're updated. 
Beyond gas, also technical, technical, um, in the sense that, 
um, we also had some of our turbines, right, that were out on maintenance. 
And so for instance, um, we have a GT19, GT19, it's 105 megawat's capacity, 
uh, turbine that was out 
of maintenance, well its back. It came in. Um, and so that increased our available capacity by, um, hundred megawats. 
And we are also expecting another, um, gas turbine to be back, um, by June and that's, uh, GT18. That's another 105 megawats. 
And in the last quarter of the year, we're expecting the last, uh, big machine that we have that is out GT16 
on road to repair in Saudi Arabia, we're expecting it back also, um, that's towards the end of November 
and that's another 105 megawats that will be coming in. 
So, um, with gas and you can see that in fact, the capacity utilization we're talking about now would, um, 
improve if, uh, you know, by the time this comes back. And, um, like I said before, hoping and, um, believing that the efforts being made in terms of infrastructure improvement 
would also materialize to result in additional load of take by inaudible. 
With regards to the embed payment. The embed payment is projected to last, um, 18 months, but again, it's about utilization, 
right? So, um, you like the 701 billion, 
you know, we found out that even- 701 inaudible 11, we found that even it lasted beyond, um, the initial period of two years that 
it was planned to last because of utilization again. 
So, that's that. We expect that inaudible and, um, 
we also expect that the outcome of the power walking group that the federal government sect to actually recommend realistic and sustainable, 
um, um, solutions that inaudible issue. 
We come up with solutions that would, um, you know, initiate the move toward sustainability… A source of sustaining electricity market in Nigeria 
which is where ultimately we're supposed to be to minimize government, uh, intervention. 
I think Owen has that inaudible issue and, um, that's it. Thank you. Okay. 
Thank you very much, Chris. Thank you. 
And Daniel, just laying it out inaudible just very briefly inaudible attend to the inaudible question, please. 
Okay, thanks, inaudible. 
Just to mention quickly actually inaudible the acquisition cost for inaudible right around 10 billion. 
inaudible around $200 million. 
So, um, by regulation 30% of that… A minimum of 30% must be by way of equity. 
So, uh, working on our financial model as well as the documentation. 
So, what amount of equity is going to be inaudible, to communicate that to Analise as well as the inaudible industry. 
But at least for a guide, a minimum of which will be 30% equity and the total acquisition cost about $200 million. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. Um, please kindly moderator on Daniel inaudible you had, uh, your hand was up before. Have your questions been addressed 
or do you have further comments? Moderator please don't move Daniel. Let's see if he has further comments or if he's… If it's already been addressed by Ralph's 
question. Ralph? Okay, um, thank you very much, Owen. Uh, my question has been addressed by, um, the answer given to Ralph already. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. I appreciate it. 
inaudible 
over to you. Yes, hello, inaudible. Hello? inaudible Sorry, is someone trying to speak? 
Yeah… inaudible Hello? Hello? It's inaudible Biden from the nation's capitol. Do you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. 
Hello. Oh, okay, great. Uh, so I have, uh, the question again about farm acquisition. I look at your presentation and see that a 
fad, uh, that 25%, uh, of the cost for that acquisition was planned to… to be paid in first quarter to 720 
and, um, looking at the financials and the cash flow I actually don't see that happening. 
Now, the rest of the cost is, uh, you- you planned to pay in third quarter… in- in second quarter of 2020. 
Uh, could you clarify what's happening with those payments 
and then, 
um, there… I- I from my point of view, you- you don't pay for that, uh, in the first quarter yet, 
uh, but you're talking about only take over a farm, uh, so that- that related to that, uh, you've been, 
um, inaudible 
down. Uh, right now, uh, in those payments related to that negotiation with early take over or is something happening apart from that? Thank you. 
Thank you very much. So, just to mention a bit about slide 14. This is the slide that had been shown before. The timelines are not adjusted because we want you to have it here. 
You'll notice my earlier comment that the timeline we had here was effected by COVID 
so in Nigeria there's been no flights into in… We have interstate restrictions of movement 
so in terms of the inaudible. Yes, it was not paid in Q1 because we're still having negotiations now 
but the timeline in terms of how things would progress, right? 
In terms of the actual division of time, not the actual date itself. 
So, from where we signed the SPA, we signed the SPA we have a specific time in which to pay the 25%. 
After we pay the 25%, then the time starts counting for the 75% as well. 
Now, in terms of the cash flow and making the payment, I think inaudible the group CFO, he addressed it earlier in his, uh, initial response. 
inaudible, maybe you want to just speak a little bit more. Maybe there was some issues with the line. 
Just quickly on this. Thank you. 
Okay, just to- just to inaudible. So, the initial 25% is not to be paid immediately when we sign the agreement, which we are looking at Q2 based on what has been going on. 
So, inaudible by the- by the process, we are supposed to pay the same 5% after six months. 
So, and take over… But what we are seeing is that we are inaudible any takeover that once we pay the 25%, which is about 27 billion, 
then we should be able to take over, which we are estimating is going to happen in Q2. Thanks. 
Thank you very much- Okay, thank you. So, if… Thank you so much. Also, I didn't get your name before inaudible the capitol but the line was shaky. Do you mind just repeating your name? 
Oh, it's Sergei Biden. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. It's almost 1:00, inaudible can we talk one more question 
if we have any? I think it looks like we don't have any further questions. Um, we actually have a question from, um, inaudible. 
I'm just going to unmute him now. Okay. inaudible from where, please? 
inaudible unmuted, please. Can you ask your question? 
Hello, there. Yeah, thanks. I hope you can hear me. Yeah, this is Meka from inaudible capitol. 
Uh, just a quick one on the inaudible date of inaudible. 
I'm just curious as to your current situation on working capital, where you have projections for Q2 2020 at 11%, uh, capacity rate. 
The ADR doesn't show when you compare it to Q1, uh, inaudible movement 
which means that, uh, inaudible in terms of the- the, uh, the top side, the revenue. 
Uh, and the question around 
the working capital is the cost being spent to be able to take on gas during the COVID period. 
Uh, 
and chasing 11% of the inaudible rate, is that, uh, in your opinion, uh, a fair allocation, right, of working capital? 
Thank you very much, Meka, that's a very good question for hospitality. So, you're right in terms of discussion of working capital 
that's at 
11% occupancy, but of course as you know, what's going on with COVID 
is 
like a temporary slow down of business across. If you're following the sto- if you're 
following the news worldwide, everyone is reopening the economy cautiously. 
From the U.S. you are having different states reopening for business. In Europe, UK, Canada… I think Toronto was in the news recently because we saw a lot of people out there. 
So, we have continued to maintain and sustain the hotel 
but we've done it very, very carefully. If you recall, when the inaudible spoke she talked about the cost of management measures that have been- that have been, um… 
That the hotel had gotten into the managements of the hotel. 
We've been very, very prudent about how we are managing the hotel and with or without inaudible speaking… I would invite her to speak to tell you just a little bit more on what we've been doing. 
But just also talk about the strength of the company. 
We've had periods of boom. We've had periods of- of, uh, a lot of inaudible. 
So, during this period of drought we have reserves we can also draw upon to take us through this time as well 
and that is a strength of our group, of our group where we can draw on our, on our resources to be able to sustain through difficult times like these. 
So, inaudible just spend like 30 seconds or one minute to take through just the measures that we've taken to make sure that we are managing the hotel at optimal cost, 
noting the revenue is constricted right now. Thank you. 
Thank you very much, Owen. I think you've actually covered it quite significantly. 
Like Owen rightly said, our focus right now is to ensure at all levels, and thankfully we started very early enough. 
At the onset of the pandemic, we took immediate action to actually reduce our cost 
and we've been very, very successful in doing that. Going forward, as the economy begins to open up, we're going to still continue to focus on driving down our cost. 
But in addition, some of the initiatives that we've introduced and continue to introduce, 
will also help us in terms of driving revenue, increasing revenue outside of just our room and conference revenue as well. 
So, what we're doing is we're actively diversifying all the key segments of the market that we normally would have addressed. 
We're targeting the leisure market and looking for different ways to make sure we bring business and inaudible into the hotel. 
So, we'll continue to do- to focus on that 
and like Owen said, you know, we are an institution that is built to last, at the end of the day, 
and so we will ride this cycle and continue to deliver more for all of our stakeholders. Thank you. 
Thank you very much, uh, Meka I hope that has answered your question. crosstalk Yes, thank you so much. 
Thank you. I really appreciate you. 
So, inaudible I think we can now conclude, conscious of time so that I respect everyone that has joined the call. 
Absolutely. Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, um, we've come to the end of the call. Um, at this point, I would like to invite, 
um, inaudible to 
give closing remarks. 
Thank you, again. Uh, just to really appreciate everyone that has taken time to come on this call. Typically we do, uh, conference call. We have a phone number that we dial into 
and this is our new normal. 
We're new normal, we're able to see ourselves. I hope 
that in next call that you would also turn on your videos so that we can see you as well as begin to put faces to the names as well. 
But just to reiterate that TransCore is on a, is on a path of success. 
As we see this year, we had significant changes that cost the group on the management side. For my appointment as the President group CU and I thank our outgoing the inaudible who 
was in the group and who has now become, uh, a known executive director on our companies. 
So, the appointments of inaudible who was eventually director and TransCore PLC before and is now managing director of TransCore power. 
inaudible who is our MVC now at TransCore hotels. 
The appointment of the executive directors and chief of inaudible officers as well in the company's inaudible for TransCore power, inaudible for TransCore hotels. 
Working with a team and others as well, we have further continued to drive our broad strategy. 
In 
power, we target to complete the acquisition of inaudible for this year, which will be, which will take us closer to that our strat- our vision 
of generating 25% of Nigeria's power. 
And our median inaudible strategy of having 2,500 megawatts in stored capacity. 
For the hospitality sector, inaudible has spent a total inaudible. We're considered to be innovative. We've already invested in our fixed assets. 
We are the clear leaders of hospitality when it comes to the brick and mortar. 
What we are now thinking about taking to the next step of what are you looking at? So, what's inaudible for the innovation that we come through in the hospitality sector. 
And we're just looking at the drive-through innovation. 
That is just amazing. 
Drive-through, drive-through concert, drive-through cinemas… and it continues to go inaudible, critical 
companies and organizations that we 
partner with us to continue to drive our innovation. On inaudible gas is critical to our business. Gas is critical to the country, just as oil inaudible. 
We'll continue to work and ensure that we are guided by very strong investment principles, especially efficiency will remain a inaudible. 
And we will continue to drive our diversification strategy but as we have seen during COVID, diversification was critical. 
Uh, inaudible sector is an essential business and has proven to be very strong. 
So, on that note, I want to say thank you to everyone 
inaudible delivering value to our shareholders and inaudible ourselves to the highest level of corporate governors. 
And on that note, I'd also like to thank the board of TransCore, chaired by Mr. Tony inaudible, the 
board of, uh, inaudible companies. We thank all of them and to say thank you very much and have a good afternoon. 
So, if you have more concern please there is a contact sheet that is on the screen right now. Please contact inaudible. 
Thank you and have a good afternoon.
