Good afternoon. This is the inaudible conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Nexi's Third Quarter 2021 financial results conference call. 
As a reminder, all participants are in listen only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. 
Should anyone need assistance during the conference call, they may signal an operator, by pressing star and zero on their telephone. 
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr Paolo Bertoluzzo, CEO of Nexi. Please go ahead, sir. 
Good morning. Good morning to everybody on this call and thank you for joining us in our third quarter results, uh, session. 
As usual I'm here with Bernardo Mingrone of CFO, inaudible is leading investor relations, but we have also a few other colleagues connected 
in here with us in case it's needed. 
Uh, as usual. 
Um, I will start giving you a little bit of an update on where 
we see, uh, the volumes going and evolving on the back of, uh, the evolution of COVID and it 
also give you a short business update with focus on merchant services. 
Then I will hand over to Bernardo, who will cover financial results and 
I will come back to give you a quick update on where we are in creating the European Paytech leader and bringing the new group, uh, together. 
And obviously I will conclude commenting on, uh, guidance that as you know, has been confirmed for, uh, the full year already. 
Um, before I go in, let me, uh… reminder to everybody, this is the first time for us, 
uh, in presenting the aggregated numbers of Nexi and Nets. 
Uh, last time you may remember Bernardo gave you, uh, an overview of what proforma, the profile 
of, uh, the new group, uh, would've looked like to kind of introduce the topic. This time we are reporting integrated Nexi-Nets. Uh, 
uh, we will, uh, cover the performances by, uh, region, which will give you an indication of how things are going. 
Uh, I will probably make a few more comments on, uh, uh, the standalone performances, but, as I said, we are reporting for the first time in an integrated way. 
Uh, and then at the end of the presentation, we leave time as always for your questions. 
Now, let me start as usual with key messages at page three. 
Uh, the three messages basically are enforcing the same three messages we had over the last couple of, uh, uh, quarters. 
Number one, uh, it served a continued volume recovery in acceleration across, uh, the various geographies 
in Italy. We continue to see a strong volume performance with Italian cards growing anywhere in between 20 to 25%, 
uh, versus 2019. That again, I remember to everybody is always our benchmark here because it was the 
pre- COVID year. Uh, next to Italy, we've seen also a good recovery in the Nordics that, uh, came back to positive over the last few weeks as a total 
with some stronger performances across, uh, many sectors. 
That region, uh, is still recovering, it's not back to the previous level at full, 
but actually seeing a stronger, basic conception growth, 
uh, and also more recently, uh, we've seen the discretionary sector coming back to positive here. The travel sector impacted 
that for, 
uh, uh, our business there still, uh, relevant in volumes, is the one that is still behind, although recovering. 
Uh, third point we see an acceleration stronger in SMEs than in LAKA. 
This has to do also with the different, uh, uh, profiles of, uh, uh, the different sectors in terms of inaudible 
and LAKA, but we believe this is really positive, uh, for our, uh, positioning and for the outlook as well. 
And last but not least, we continue to see 
clear signals of acceleration of cash to digital payments transitions across all sectors and visible in all geographies, also the ones that are already more penetrated. 
Message number one. Message number two, also in the third quarter, we've seen strong and growing financial performance 
revenues for the group. Uh, we're at 10.1% in the quarter in acceleration versus the previous two quarters, for a total of 9.6% 
in the nine months. 
We've seen in particular, strong revenue growth performance, in national services and solutions with… for both Nexi and Nets, 
very similar levels plus 12.2% for the total in the third water, 
10.6 here to date. And again, here, you see an acceleration. 
E-commerce revenues were particularly strong at plus 32%, despite the fact that the travel related sectors are still affected by COVID. Uh, 
EBITDA in the quarter was up 14.6%, up to 
12.3% from the beginning of the year with continued margin expansion that in the third quarter was at 53%, 
up two percentage points versus last year. 
Third message. We continue to progress in the creation of the European Paytech leader. 
Here, as reported again, stronger standalone performance and will comment on a dedicated page. 
As you know, we have received the Antitrust approval on October 14th, on the combination of an Nexi and Sia, and the closing is now expected by year end. 
In the meantime, we have closed the deal, uh, with Intesa on the UBI merchant book. 
Uh, yesterday we've also signed the 
dealer with Alpha Bank to create a joint venture in merchant services deal in Greece, closing the spec that at some point, 
in the second half, 
probably the second quarter, uh, of, uh, sorry, in the second half, probably the second quarter of, uh, uh, next year. 
Last but not least, uh, we made them… have done a small, but actually strategic investment 
for our future in a company, it's called Ordebad and is leading DACH inaudible software solution for the hospitality sector inaudible. 
In other geographies, 
it's a small investment talking of only about 16 million euros. We've increased our, uh, ownership from 20%, we were already there, to 40% 
with a clear path to control. 
And we are very happy for this because it is the first real SML 
test for us in entering, in a deeper way, the software space especially for SMEs, 
starting from Germany. This is a very strategic market for us in expanding in other places as well. 
On the back of all of this, we've confirmed our ambition for 2021 on a Nexi-Nets combined 
level revenues. We expect them to grow at about 10% year over year. And EBITDA, expect EBITDA to grow at 11 to 13% year over year. 
Now, before I go into volumes, let me jump to page five. As a quick reminder, this is the new profile of the group. 
Uh, we have a group that sees about 60% of the revenues in national services and solutions with a strong exposure to E-commerce. 
29% is what we call cars and digital payments, and the remaining 10% in what we call digital banking and corporate solutions. 
Second, the group, uh, is highly, highly exposed to market with super strong and very, very long term and secular growth opportunity in digital payments. 71% 
is, uh… of our revenues are in low penetration markets, such as Italy, such as German, such as the 
Central, uh, uh, European ones and Southern European ones. 
Uh, number three, 64% of our revenues are coming from, uh, volume and, uh, the 36% from installed or installed, 
uh, uh, like, uh, uh, type of, 
uh inaudible, last but not least, we have a very strong operating leverage. 
Now let me jump into volumes and recovery pretty fast and then I will also give you an highlight on what we see happening in the other key geographies. Page number six 
is the usual page. The dark blue line is the total here. We're focusing on merchant services where we have more insights 
and therefore the dynamics are more interesting. 
The dark blue line is the total. 
The, uh, uh, the, the lighter blue line is actually on Italian card, the gray one is on international card and for visitors to Italy. 
Here, you see that, uh, after the summer, we continue to basically grow revenues compared to 2019, 
anywhere in between 10 to 20%, sometimes also above 20%. 
And here there is a clear, strong contribution from Italian cards that been growing anywhere in between 20 to 30% over the last few months. 
I would say particularly interesting is also, uh, uh, the dynamic in, uh, in the international visitors card. 
Here, you see that you had a very, very fast recovery, uh, in the summer leading to August, where now we went back to the levels of pre- 
COVID, uh, mainly driven by European visitors with, uh, Americans and, uh, and the 
Asians being still, uh, not present or present in a very limited way. 
Uh, then with the slowdown again, but then a strong recovery over the last few weeks. Uh, uh, the, the… 
This dynamic is probably explained by the fact that, uh, the touristic side of international travel, 
is recovering fast. People are really keen to travel as soon as they can do it. 
Well, actually the business traveler, uh, dynamic is still, uh, uh, is still behind and therefore, depending on the moment of the 
season, probably we will continue to see these dynamics happening. 
Hopefully the recovery of October is, uh, also due the, to the fact that, 
uh, we have, uh, we had, uh, less restrictions also for business travel so it's a combination of business travelers 
coming a bit back and actually holidays in some countries in Europe, uh, in the latter part of October as well. 
Jumping to page seven, we have the usual split by macro sectors. 
Uh, this is the total, so this is not separating Italian cards versus international cards 
and therefore the sectors are also affected by the dynamic that I was explaining before. Here, we see, uh, very strong, continued growth 
in the basic consumption 
sectors like groceries, utility, 
uh, uh, medical, um, and so and so forth growing anywhere around the 30%, 30, 34%, 37 in the last, 
uh, uh, week. And we see the other two sectors now moving, uh, uh, kind of similarly anywhere in between, I would say five to 10%, uh, year over year, 
uh, with a super strong recovery, I would say, definitely faster than expected in particular in, uh, uh, uh, in, uh, in the impact sectors and I would say in particular in restaurants, 
uh, and, uh, bars. 
Uh, so this is the dynamic we are observing, uh, in Italy. We'll come back in a moment, uh, to give you a bit more insight on specific sub sectors, because I think it's interesting. 
On page eight, we see instead the dynamics… We've observed the dynamics, uh, uh, in the Nordics area and in the DACH region. 
Uh, if you just take the total before going into the sub sectors 
space, uh, we have observed a plus 12% growth in October across, both 
across the Nets, if you like, uh, uh, geographies, uh, 
12% growth of our SMEs, 
uh, versus 2019 LAKA instead, we're still behind, 
but actually if you strip out the effect of their impact consumption sectors growing as well, uh, uh, plus 8%. 
Uh, last but not least, we also see good recovery in issuing, now growing 5% in Nets' geographies and basically this one is 
mainly, uh, uh, relating to the Nordics. 
Um, as we're talking about the Nordics here you see in the top graph, the dynamic. Nordics have been back to positive from September 
and actually growing further in October as a total. They've been growing 7% versus 2019 in terms of volumes. 
Actually the last week is… was actually double digit with 12%, 
very strong and continued performance on the basic consumption sectors, about 30%, actually 45 in the last, uh, week. 
Uh, the discretionary consumption sector, uh, uh, trending a bit slower, but now close to zero 
and a good recovery over the last few months also for the high impact sectors, uh, over the last month at minus 1%. 
Uh, last but not least in the DACH region and here, most of the volumes are actually associated to Germany. 
Here you see a continued strong performance of growth in the basic consumption sectors. 
Uh, you see actually, uh, discussionary services going back to, uh, uh, a positive, uh, 
8% last week, 2% in October versus 2019. 
Here, the sector is still behind. It is actually the one that is related to travel, 
uh, and here, uh, in Germany, there's an important impact on the total mix and this is one of the reasons why, the key reason why 
actually Germany is still behind, compared to 2019 
volumes. 
So this is the total feature, page nine, a bit more into the specific sectors to reinforce the point that I think we made over the last many calls. 
I would say that, uh, we have been observing 
underneath these COVID related dynamics, uh, a very strong acceleration of the transition from, 
uh, cash to digital payments, not only in under penetrated markets like Italy, but also in more penetrated markets like the Nordics. And 
here you 
see at page nine, a few examples here with the pick from top to bottom, the top, uh, eight, uh, um, sectors per market. 
Uh, uh, some of them maybe are less relevant in size, but here you see actually also very relevant sectors. 
uh, think of the restaurants and bars in Italy, 34% growth of groceries, 25% growth, 
nicely growing, uh, uh, old double digit next to some very special ones like doctors, 82%, for example. 
Nordic similarly groceries, 23%, 25% versus 2019. 
Again for a market that, uh, we tend to believe that is already highly penetrated, a big… is a big positive in our opinion. And then you see 
some more specialized, smaller sectors such as for example, cosmetic or hardware growing at 40%, 59%, 
and so on. Last but not least also in the DACH region, groceries, 49%. 
Also restaurants, despite that some limitations been instilled in place, 
13% and many other sectors growing double digit 
with actually department stores, uh, uh, growing triple digit but, uh, I would look at it, uh, with a lot of sympathy that is swelling up, 
uh, the, the benchmark for the other sectors of inaudible for now. 
So this is basically the picture, uh, uh, in terms of volumes. 
Um, before I hand over Bernardo to cover financial results, 
I would love to dive with you for a few minutes on, the dynamics and the key initiative that we are observing in particular in merchant services 
that as you know, is, uh, more than half of our revenues and is always, uh, up inaudible focused not just for us, but also for, uh, uh, for, uh, for you and for, uh, investors, uh, more broadly. 
And here we try to give a little bit of a feeling of what we are doing in the different, uh, 
uh, uh, segments. inaudible this by SMEs that represent almost 60% of our revenues, uh, in national services, E-con that represent about 25% 
and also LAKA 
that is a bit less than 10% of total revenues. 
If you're asking yourself why they don't sum up to 100, the reason is that there is a 7% 
that has to do with acquiring ATMs as we call it cash 
and it is not allocatable to any segment. For simplicity reasons that are allocated inaudible 
as revenues to SMEs, because most of it is really SMEs. 
Now, uh, uh, going, uh, uh, uh, one by one. 
In essence, we see a strong acceleration on our, on our digital proposition, um, uh, in Germany, 
positive results in Germany, on the back of, uh, uh, the very positive result we had in the Nordics, as well as in Italy. We are promoting more and more, uh, the, uh, uh, mobile post proposition for new… to, 
uh, 
merchant, uh, sub sector. Uh, at the same time, no, we are very successfully, uh, pushing on vertical propositions in the, 
in, in, uh, in, in the specific, uh, sectors. We've started in Italy, 
uh, uh, we've dedicated a go-to market for, uh, very nano verticals, for example, restaurant, cafes, hotels, 
uh, uh, retail, and so and so forth 
where we package, 
uh, very often from the distribution go-to market point to view, but sometimes also pricing end 
product itself. And this is really, uh, uh, uh, eating the ground well with customers. 
At the same time, we are increasing our focus on IVs and more in general, the software space. 
Uh, and here, uh, uh, basically there are two things we are doing. On the one side we're expanding our partnerships across all geographies, I would say, with ISVs. 
Uh, and if you count them across the board, we can't count them actually for this call, 
it's actually more than 500 partnerships in the ISV space. 
And there are mix of partnerships with local leaders, uh, on, uh, uh, merchants, uh, uh, CRM and ERP softwares. 
For example, Team System, just to mention one. 
Uh, and many, many, many smaller, uh, much smaller vertical specialists that very often are local 
companies as well. And we normally partner, we do technical integration and some of them, we do also go-to market together. 
As we anticipated, uh, now with Oderbad we're one level deeper 
as, uh, no, we will, uh, integrate more on the proposition side as well, and we'll test it in one segment in one market that expanded further as 
we go along. 
In the SME segment, um, uh, uh, basically we, we have not seen any major news in terms of competitive dynamics. 
Uh, we know, I mean, we discussed it in the past that we have, uh, uh, important competition in the new to… uh, new two digital payments 
segment, the smaller merchants that are started to use digital payments for the first time in particular, in Italy, in particular, also in 
Germany from basically one player, uh, that is inaudible 
that actually successful in the market in winning a number of customers, but actually the value associated with these customers, given the size of them is, uh, normally very small. 
Uh, we have also increased in Italy, our focus, uh, in, uh, uh, that segment and we are actually quite successful. We have doubled 
our acquisition bonds, but we're also focusing, uh, in, in, uh, winning back these customers as they grow, 
uh, and when they need the proposition, it is more structural and more complete. 
This is in terms of SMEs, the volumes across our inaudible were up about 14% in the quarter compared to the same quarter, 
2019. Um, eCommerce which represent about 25%, 
uh, of our, uh, revenues in merchant services, see- seeing a lot of dynamics, a lot of new players coming, some of them going as well, 
uh, to be honest with you. And by the way, this is a sector where we have a new segment, a new propositions emerging as well. 
We need to talk more about it in our inaudible sessions, but let me give you a flavor of what we are doing here. 
Uh, first of all, when it comes to the more PSP, like, uh, type of position for the acceptance 
propositions, uh, uh, we are launching easy in Germany after, uh, uh, a pretty good success in the Nordics, 
as a collecting PSP proposition at the same time, uh, we are extending our PSP proposition, uh, uh, in terms of capability 
in Italy, it's called Xpay. 
And we are extending this proposition also in the back of the experience and the capabilities that we have in Nets, for example, in one, three checkouts, uh, and cards 
pre-onboarding. 
Uh, in, uh, the nine month, our E-commerce activations in Italy had been up 70% compared to the same period, uh, two years ago, just to give you a flavor. 
At the same time years, uh, uh, we are seeing a lot of activity in the alternative payment method space here. 
Uh, our angle is twofold. We know… We own alternative payment methods, and at the same time, we partner 
with inaudible at the, uh, payment method to make them available for our gateways to our merchant customers. 
If you focus for a moment on, uh, account to account propositions, 
we actually have a very strong position, a successful position, both in Poland and Finland 
and they're growing very, very strongly. 
At the same time we are onboarding more and more, uh, account to account solutions to our gateway, for example, inaudible pay, uh, 
in, uh, uh, Italy. 
Uh, similarly, similarly in Buy Now, Pay Later, we have a very strong proposition called inaudible in Germany. We own the proposition, that proposition is growing, 
uh, very, very strongly. 
Uh, but again, that is the proposition that is made available not only through our gateway solutions, 
uh, in Germany, but also to basically every other, uh, national international PSP active, uh, in the country. At the same time in the other geographies, 
uh, we are partnering more and more with party, 
uh, by now politic providers, because at the end of the day as a PSP, we must be able to offer, uh, uh, all possible payment methods, uh, to, uh, 
our, uh, merchant customers, uh, in inaudible to allow them to basically maximize their conversion rates, uh, checkout. 
Um, last but not least, we continue to, uh, strike partnerships with, uh, uh, with, uh, E-commerce enabler platforms, 
uh, across all markets. Uh, we have about, uh, we actually have more than 10 partnerships across the group. Many of them, 
uh, uh, are with players that are present in more than one market. 
Today, we cover about 66- 76% of the relevant market. Today E-commerce enables cover, uh, across our geography, about 10% 
of the volumes that basically serve the tiniest inaudible in the micro-merchants, uh, 
the micro-SMEs, 
uh, in E-commerce we cover through technology integration, um, and, uh, in certain cases we also go to market partnership percent of 
that. 
Uh, again here volumes are growing 13% despite no, uh, uh, the travel related sector still being, uh, uh, uh, suffering. 
The reason why the growth rate of revenues, uh, is actually well above 30% 
is because, uh, when it comes to account to account and Buy Now, Pay Later solutions that we own, the growth rate is very, very strong, and it's contributing to the 
total growth. 
Last but not least, uh, uh, the LAKA of segment represents about 9% of our total revenues in, uh, merchant services. 
Here, 
Uh, uh, we don't see any major news, 
uh, in terms of, uh, uh, uh, uh, competition. Obviously we continue to see active, very active players, like, uh, 
inaudible in very specific segments that are basically segments of the global brands 
in particular, I would say in luxury, uh, and, uh, in, uh, fashion. 
Uh, to be very clear, 
uh, uh, we continue to, uh, uh, compete successfully and win in the sectors that instead are more local, uh, in nature, 
uh, such as for example, food, retail, household, goods mobility, insurance, public administration, and so on and so forth. 
Basically, no, we win and continue to win where the physical components of the omnichannel solutions is actually relevant for these companies where they need the complex needs in terms of terminals and terminals, acquiring acceptance 
of integration, where the local integration with local payment method is important, where the vertical sector integration is important, where customization is important, you know. 
At the end of the day, uh, no, uh, that's the core of what we do thanks to our, uh, local entrenchment. 
And here we continue to serve successfully, no, uh, uh, not only at the local, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, large merchants, but also global brands that are present, uh, in market with the characteristic that just describes 
so across our geographies, we cover and serve merchants such as, for example, Ikea Sky 
inaudible I mean, names that appear in international names, but require 
very specific local support, integration, and, uh, delivery. 
Now, before I move on, let me use one example of something that we had announced yesterday. It is actually today's mold but I think it's also a good example of, uh, what, uh, we see as, uh, as, as the core of, uh, the nature of, uh, the new Nexi group. 
I think we said in the past that, and in many… inaudible I think we said in the past, inaudible but at the end of the day, our strategy is quite simple. 
We want to combine the scale that is necessary to drive hard innovation, based on innovation in particular 
and when we send, confidence is important, investments are important for scale. 
So we want to remain competitive with the global players, specialized players. We want to cancel product proposition 
innovation, but at the same time we also want to be very very locally entrenched, thanks to all the people, thanks to all the ecosystem integration that we have in the different geographies. 
And one simple example of this on top of the many I've given to you over the last few minutes, 
it's a new product we launched recently, it's called foreign language as a pay by account. 
This is a very nice product because it is an account to account payment product 
that we are making available to begin with in commerce that will be available also on management solutions for end SME as well. 
We're actually integrating many capabilities that we have, not all the merchant services but it also depends, banking space… 
Now to deliver a solution that we're making available to our PSP merchant customers 
in that, I believe they're progressing also to other PSPs also that want to operate in Italy. 
And this solution is basically a leveraging open banking enabler that we provide because we are a provider of different banking systems for Italy. 
Our capability in this space 
plus our local accesses plus our local integration plus our low profitabilities on eCommerce side, and 
basically a merchant can offer the opportunity to some customers to pay by the bank account 
without registering on anything 
because inaudible banking, the customers find a click button on the checkout page, 
you click on the button, then basically 
the um… the page of the bank will open, the customer will identify themselves with the standard 
identification method of the bank 
and the transaction will happen 
because it's pre, already filled on the different components inaudible and the transaction will happen automatically. 
Again, there's no thing inaudible global scale but also being locally 
entrenched and integrated. Clearly it is targeting not necessarily the small production but actually a large production because inaudible can take for the moment, up to 
15,000 Euros pre-production, and going forward, 
even more. 
inaudible I really wanted to try and give you a flavor of what is happening in this space. Bernardo. 
Thanks Paolo. So just, we'll try and be quick here so we as much space as possible for Q&A. 
Starting on slide 12, we've seen how revenues have grown approximately 10% in the quarter and 10$ in the nine months. As Paolo said earlier, 
this is how what we discussed in terms of volumes and in terms of the business updates translates into the financials. 
I think it's important to underline how growth in revenues is very similar growth, and I guess that's the message I would like to leave you with. 
In terms of foreign language we can see there's been a two percentage point increase year on year and the quarter, and the same applies if we look at the nine months. 
And most of this accretion actually comes from nets, we 
have less of an accretion this year on nets as we've discussed in the past due to the fact that we're unwinding or 
let's say there is… 
coming out of last year, we have the fact of certain costs, of the cost cutting exercise we had last year, which impacts our growth and costs next, this 
year as expected. 
So two percentage points accretion which is in line with our expectations. 
On slide number 13, we see how the various travel fees performed. Italy, 
Italy is strong, a strong performance in the quarter with 12% growth, accelerating compared to, compared 
12% versus 2019. Accelerating 38% we had in the first nine months, so again, good signs of recovery from COVID. Back in 
Poland had even stronger growth, we have close to 18% growth in nine months, 19% if you're including the quarter. 
Actually Germany growing more than Poland thanks to the strong exposure we have in Germany to eCommerce and BMP, I'm sure Paolo referred to earlier. 
And then Nordics and southeastern Europe, slightly different dynamic. 
Again, there is less exposure say to eCommerce to compensate in Germany and Poland for the slow recovery in terms of coming out of the lockdown in some of the former, or in some of the geographies. And that's just a present process 
as we'll see later the effect in 
the Nordics of the… as we mentioned in the past, the fact that we have renegotiated the last 
major contract and that has hit us in 2021. 
Moving on to the various divisions, we have merchant services 
and solutions where we've had a very strong quarter with double digit revenue growth 
across the group, and this is true as I said, both at the next level. 
Nets has proven to be extremely resilient to those geographies, you 
can see that transactions have recovered very nicely throughout the group and we have 15% year to year growth for the nine months 
and this was only partially offset by slightly slower growth in some of the other geographies due to their different phasing of lockdown. 
I think it's important to underscore how eCommerce has continued to grow nicely, 
we have 37 percentage growth in the third quarter this year, 32% if you look at the nine months. 
And this is also sustained as I said earlier through a strong performance in Germany and Poland. 
Just a word of 
explanation with regards to a trend which in the past has been different in terms of the growth and volumes of international schemes which is lower than the overall volume growth, 
this is due to a factor in Italy of domestic debit cards now being able to transact contactless, transacting on the domestic scheme rather than 
the international schemes, and this causes some version of the trend. 
On slide 15 we can see the data for cards and digital payments. 
Even in this division we have good revenue growth with good volume recovery, here the volume recovery as you can see is what we're more used to, 
where the trend that highlights the shift to domestic debit and contactless transactions is more than offset by the fact that we are 
moving some of our, 
we're progressively moving our domestic debit cards into international debit cards which fuel the growth in international schemes. 
But overall, we have strong growth in the quarter so… In cards and individual payments. 
Slide 16, we can see how DBS, or digital bank and corporate solutions it's now called, performed in the nine months. 
This, we have discussed this in the past is a division in which project related revenue, which is recurring by nature, even though it's not contractualized, 
but every year we have project work for 
our partner banks mainly 
in the various geographies has been from a seasonality perspective present more in the first half of the year, 
hence the deceleration you can see from 11% to 5%. So 11% through the first nine months and 5% for the last quarter. 
Overall I would say that performance 
has been in line with our overall expectations. Maybe in Italy we have had a bit of a slow 
down which will also impact us, it has impacted us this year on monthly inaudible as they were discussing potential transactions, credit. That is no longer the case so hopefully we'll recover some of the 
lost revenues there in 2022. 
Slide 17 shows us the cost dynamic. I think it's important to look at the commentary we've put into the side of 
this slide where we try and give you a picture of what the cost dynamics really look like if we normalized for last year. I mentioned earlier that in next, 
I reminded you that next year we had a cost containment program which was 100 million Euros of cash cost 
last year to protect our inaudible and our cash flow. 
This unwinds this year and hence we have a bounce back of pools on variable compensation and a bounce back of travel expenses and the likes. 
If we normalize for those, I'd say two items in HR costs for instance, the overall HR costs would actually be flat year on year. 
There is some slight, say increase due to the annualization of people who were hired last year, 
but overall basically flat HR costs if we normalize for a variable comp. 
With regards to other non HR 
costs, these would be up 1.4% 
if we normalize for the growth in volume, so effectively obviously, revenues are growing, we've seen double digit, our cost base grows by 1.4% so 
if we take out the growth in volume driven processing costs, patch them into the fixed nature of most of our cost base. 
With regards to debt position of the group, 
we should look at it with… or at least I look at it with included we have received anti trust approval, and Paolo will speak to this 
in a second, but basically now we have the certainty 
if we look at the combined numbers, both inaudible 
adding onto the last 12 months, you'll also see is 327, you review for the last 12 months 
and we include 828 million Euros of net debt, 
our overall ratio is 3.6 times leverage, which is also three times if we include run with synergies, which we announced as part of this transaction. 
And this we expect to unwind pretty quickly any leverage profile, which we highlighted in announcement. 
Just a reminder that three quarters of our debt is fixed rate, so moving into 
a say, potentially higher rate environment, I think we feel pretty comfortable with regards to out capital structure. 
So with that said, I will pass the floor back onto Paolo so he can take us through the MNA optic including March. Thank 
you Bernardo, page 20, pick up that on CS reports of the last few days there for the quarter. 
The revenues were up 9.3% 
and inaudible was up 12.9% so very close to the rest of the group 
performance. 
Year to date results are even higher than this, I think as we anticipated that at the beginning of the conversation around Sia, 
the first half of the year is a bit richer than the second half, 
basically due to phasing and very specific events, nothing to do with underlying. 
As far as the inaudible is concerned, as you know, the Italian trust approved the lien on October 14th, 
the foreign language specifically in 
the areas that are connected to Michelin products 
and the signing conditions were what our expectations were. It is very much correct. 
In terms of revenue there is only one of them that is 
structural and this remedy is to do with what I would call the national clearing non set clearing. 
The size of that business is about 6 million Euro 
of revenues for the year. About two or three 
of foreign language declining because we are talking about products, such as for example, checks. 
It would inaudible to implement these remedies as we speak, 
and we expect to close by the end of the year, we still have two or three 
positions missing, but they tend to be a bit more technical or in any case, they're due at the end of the process, such as for example, Italian structures change regulator 
for the approval of the prospects. 
And everything else is in line in terms of preparing for the execution of the closing within this timeframe. 
On page 21 we have a bit broader update on what is happening on the various fronts. 
You may remember inaudible and so forth. 
Quick update on the technology side, basically 
we already have one new group technology plan and we already started to execute around some areas. For example, CAPEX 
inaudible are pulling 
together group delivery and their one hub, 
optimizing for pressure, ready to execute processing platform consolidation 
as soon as we close Sia and many other areas of initiatives. 
As far as inaudible is concerned, 
we have already started to optimize to other management in the foreign language and we are ready to execute 
the fuller integration next year in Italy while there are many other operational initiatives already ongoing. 
As far as procurement is concerned, we're still working on this inaudible and 
we have a very good plan 
defined and we already closed 12 strategic propositions. And as far as revenues are concerned, we touched 
on a few of them before but they're already working together, starting with the lower end employees. 
And even on the CSI that we use a 
team approach to prepare, we've already obtained a commercial plan to deliver them out as soon as we close, end up selling more products and services to 
our customers 
in Italy to begin 
with. Oh and, we expect to have synergies for about 100 million Euros of cash 
for next year. 
Part of business CAPEX as you can imagine, one of things is it's easier to optimize and faster to optimize but we're progressing on all initiatives. 
Here I'm talking about one of them being inaudible through the year, and therefore our opposite exit rate would be much higher than that. 
We will now move to page 23. 
This is short, we are basically simply confirming the guidance 
that we gave you last time when we talked for the first time about the new aggregated group. 
This is obviously for net and… net, just remember that we will update our guidance at quarter one, 
and that one we'll talk about next week. We're 
now confirming all of this, 
10%, from about 10% revenue growth in the year. About 11 to 13% growth with margin expansion, 
both versus 2020 and even more 2019 which was normally about 3% shrunk back into 17, 18. inaudible 
that one Bernardo will show you, continue the inaudible 

generation and progressing the leveraging over longer and starting from a new level that is exactly in line with what the plan was with what we had announced with Sia and Connect. 
So page 24, 
I will not go through all of it again. Key messages for today, 
continue the record acceleration of volumes across all geographies with clear signals of acceleration of cash to each payment across again, all geographies. 
Match performance with double digit revenue growth in the quarter and further margin expansion as well and a very strong performance 
in merchant services and solutions, and last but not least, progressing according to our plan and matching ahead and putting the new group together 
as a combination of the next step 
in Sia. And last but not last, as we said, a concern for the condition for the fiscal year. 
I'll stop there and open up for your questions. 
Excuse, this is the group conference operator, we will now begin the question and answer session. 
Anyone who wants to ask a question may press * and 1 on their inaudible telephone. 
To remove yourself from the question queue please press * and 2. 
Please pick up the receiver when asking questions. Anyone who has a question may press * and 1 at this time. 
The first question is from Sebastian foreign language please go ahead. 
Yeah hello everyone and thanks for taking the question. 
So I know it's a bit early to provide any pre size indication for 2022 but, 
just wondering if you could address a little bit of the stem, the dynamic beyond yourself and your margins going into 2022. 
We are seeing Dutch or Nordic credit recovering, 
is it reasonable to assume the kind of acceleration of the trend moving into next year? 
And a second question would be more on the competitive landscape to understand a little bit 
what is happening in your main market Italy. We've discussed a couple of times, competitive landscape, but on your new markets like Nordics or 
Dutch, who do you see in 
those markets and 
do you see any fast growing inaudible 
in those markets moving from online to in stores and trying to compete on the S&P or it is not already the case? Thank you. 
Hi Sebastian and thank you for the questions. So listen, 2022 we'll talk about guidance for 2022 in February, 
that's when I will try to give you our view for the year. 
I think when we did that announcement we said that 
our ambition was to obviously increase the speed of growth for the company and a larger and more resilient parameter. 
Our previous take on it if you wish inaudible 5 to 10% of revenues as 
well as another 14 to 16% and with that our plan is to obviously do better than that on the back of 
the new complex and the new group profile. 
Then, every single region has its own dynamics, clearly we see it as we're preparing the budget. As you can imagine, we're actually having, 
in terms of volume, there's good expectations from the Nordics, 
but then there are many other specific dynamics that have to do with our 
specific contracts, our specific areas of investment so I really prefer to wait and give you a more detailed commentary when we come 
to February and a global picture. But 
I believe that what we're serving as we speak and the data that we show you in terms of specific individual sectors are confirming that we see growth potential in the Nordics as well on top of all this, 
Italy or Germany, all these places like Poland 
or central eastern Europe. 
When it comes to the dynamics in other markets, I think that in other markets we are seeing other dynamics that I mentioned before, 
I mean, in inaudible 
you see these… but to be honest with you, 
there's really some more we don't see, for the moment, geographies, other players becoming more visible or more aggressive so there's a competition that we know and it's very much focused on 
neutral carbon segments. 
In the commerce space you tend to see a little bit of the same players around, inaudible we'll measure a 
new dynamic there, 
creating… making a more inaudible 
in Shopify or in the markets where Shopify is strong. 
But as I said before, all of this is strengthening our partnerships with the other contingent 
systems in eCommerce. 
And when it comes to foreign language 
I would say a bit more the same of what I said before. Actually being more present, and in general intentional, 
our clients being more present, but nothing really major. 
As you know by now, buy now, pay later is becoming a bigger 
phenomenon and we're actually benefiting from that inaudible 
Klarna is becoming more active in the Nordics and also in Germany as well. 
inaudible honestly we're not very exposed as we have been in the past. 
When it comes to D2 or line players moving more in store, inaudible for the moment we don't see 
a lot of movement. 
We don't have yet any particularly successful of other PSPs or account to account providers 
or now inaudible 
is the majority of our revenue 
in merchant services. It remains a very specific space, it is very local, 
it is very still very much connected with banks, 
requires a lot of specific attention and the more segmented the more we arrive at 
it because even more locals are now… 
So I would say nothing's really new from that angle. 
Thank you Paolo. The next question is from James Goodman with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Yeah good afternoon, thank you very much. Just looking into the fourth quarter firstly, I mean you've reiterated, clearly the guidance, the 10% grade, 
you previously specified an H2 grade to get there, I think it would be 11 to 13% and obviously 
we can sort of do the calculation around Q4. But I guess my question is, is it fair to expect an acceleration, perhaps across all your geographies 
into Q4? I mean, we've got a weaker comparative space I think in the Italian business, including the progressive reopening across 
the Nordics, but particularly DAC I mean, given the travel exposure that you have there. 
That's the first question. And then maybe to sort of follow up on the inaudible for the quarter and for the outlook, 
can you make a comment just on… 
I mean we can see the revenue I suppose more or less structured next year net to the quarter, but can you just make a comment on the debit 
uh, performance between next, to the quarter, as 
we look out to the full year there, 
they're sort of in the middle 
of your 11 to 13% range at the moment, 
but depending on what you say about revenues for Q4, is there any reason to expect debit not to sort of grow similar to revenues in the fourth quarter? Thank you. 
crosstalk Bernardo you'll take- Yeah 
sure. So the question on the fourth quarter, it's a difference between our guidance and where we are in the third quarter. As you said, the math is pretty easy. 
What we can say is that we expect the fourth quarter revenue to accelerate compared to the third quarter, and this is primarily driven by merchant services performances that we expect to be strong in the fourth quarter and stronger 
than you want in the third quarter. 
Overall for the year though, I would say that… I would take what Paolo said with regards to our rule guidance, which is to grow revenues double digit. 
The second question you asked was on, what was it? On inaudible for next year nets, is that right? Yeah just in the quarter, EBITDA between the two businesses 
and, yeah crosstalk in the fourth quarter between revenue and EBITDA. Yeah so 
in the third quarter, the EBITDA is decided when we discuss the margin accretion primarily from the growth nets right? Where 
we had a significant step up from second quarter to third quarter, 19% growth in EBITDA. 
I think that's what we would like to stick to for now in the comments 
for the fourth quarter funds. I'm excited that we've confirmed guidance where you have a guidance pro inaudible Okay, thank you. 
The next question is from Stefan foreign language with Odo. Please go ahead. 
Yes, good afternoon. First of all, I'd like to ask an update maybe on the Sia process 
if you have any view on when you will start to consolidate the CIV into the group. 
And the second question is also uh, regarding Italy, where you said that there was a 20 to-… steady, uh, where you said that, uh, there was, uh, 20 to 25%, uh, growth. 
Uh, do you see this, uh, trend continuing into 2020? 
Uh, 
and uh, if you expect, uh, kind of, uh, help plan from the, from the Italian government to, 
uh, to push further this, uh, this inaudible? Thank you. 
Hi, Stephan. Thank you for, uh, the question. 
Let me take the second one, and then I- I- I will, uh, a- a- ask Bernardo to, uh, cover the first one, uh, and give you more the taste what a- a- a- I've already done. 
Listen, I- I- I think, um, we are very happy, what we are seeing, uh, in Italy in terms of, uh, growth, uh, uh, uh, of, uh, of, uh, of volumes, 
uh, in particular inaudible. We expect this actually, to continue into, uh, uh, into next year, even if the competitors become more and more difficult. 
Uh, the reality is that, um, uh, today you still have a little bit of limitations, uh, uh, here, and uh, there. 
But honestly, even with project, uh, the fourth quarter, this year 
we expect to continue to see a bit, uh, further, recovery and potentially therefore, uh, 
volume, uh, acceleration. Uh, but, uh, we remain quite, uh, uh, quite, uh, quite optimistic on, uh, on, uh, on the outlook. 
Um, taking into consideration the fact that, uh, that even if, uh, no, uh, most of 
the activity, uh, all the activity 
are still open, are already, uh, are now open. Uh, you still have some, uh, some, uh, uh, some kind of, uh, uh, complexity there, for some of these, uh, uh, some of these activities. Um, grant initiatives, uh, 
I think, uh, as we commented in the past, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, we, uh, believe every government will continue to support inaudible, because, uh, of the many, many positive, uh, contribution that it gives, uh, to society, the economy, the 
position, uh, transparency, and, and so on and so forth. 
The, 
um, um, this government, uh, has decided not to, uh, uh, uh, to basically stop, uh, the cashback. It was the most visible, uh, initiative. 
And, 
uh, uh, and, uh, uh, because basically it was not convinced on some of the mechanics. 
Uh, and it's obviously finance. We said in the past, uh, our plans, our 
expectations are not, uh, uh, driven by that. What we said the cash pool is a very good initiative, a nice initiative, but, uh, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, basically changing the shape of our, 
uh, 
profile. Uh, the good thing is that this government is actually, is actually decided, and, and, and implemented two more, 
uh, uh, two, two newer initiatives that are more on the merchant side. 
And therefore, they're incentivizing the merchants to basically upgrade their, their shop equipment and inaudible basically. 
Uh, um, uh, and at the same time, basically, for one year, they're also supporting inaudible merchants, um, uh, in terms of giving them the possibility that from the taxes 
the, the commissions that they pay. 
So, uh, uh, ch- changing the nation on, uh, on, uh, uh, on cashback, 
uh, uh, but actually a confirmed belief of importance of, uh, uh, supporting, uh, uh, digital payments through, uh, 
I would say, the merchants. And they're happily cooperating with, uh, 
uh, as much as we can with, uh, uh, with the governmental institutions, probably implementing all of this 
and continuously provide, uh, uh, further ideas, uh, uh, and, uh, and, uh, opportunities. Uh, 
Bernardo, you want to cover crosstalk. Sorry, on-… the process one? On CRN, in terms of the process, there's a bullet point on Slide 20, Where Are We? 
We're expecting, uh, BaFin approval anytime soon. 
It's, uh, pretty, I would say, uh, administrative process here. There's actually a typo in the presentation, The Danish Investment Authorities have approved the transaction. And then, 
we will need to have the prospectus, 
uh, um, 
the prospectus, uh, with the pro forma numbers approved by inaudible Stock Exchange regulators, similarly for what we did with, uh, with NET. And that should happen again somewhere in mid-December. 
So, we now have, I'd say, deal certainty give that, uh, anti-trust approval which, uh, was, uh, the, the one where most of the work needed to be done. 
And has been obtained and we're looking to close at midnight of the 31st of December. 
Uh, that means, going back to your question, we will be consolidating from the first of January next year. 
So, we will have a full year, uh, uh, of, of consolidated, uh, numbers for SIA. And we will obviously, as part of this provide you with, uh, comparison numbers for 2021, 
which include SIA and Nets as if we had bought it from the first of January 
of, uh, of this year. So, you will have a, a, a same perimeter, um, and the same will go with, uh, with the database that the client puts on the website. 
This, by the way, is also true for the UBI book acquisition, which closed on the 26th of October. But has retroactive ef- uh, effects from the 1st of January. 
Um, and the same will happen when we close, uh, the Alpha Bank, uh, uh, deal, which will be in the second quarter of next year. 
So, we will always strive to make sure you have a meaningful like-for-like comparison of the same perimeter. But the closing of SIA is midnight this year. 
So, from first of January next year, you have the consolidated numbers 
in the actual accounts. Okay, thank you. I, I, 
I have quick follow-up on Germany. Uh, did you see any weakness, uh, in Q3 compared to what you were expecting? 
And are you concerned about the rise in number of COVID case that could 
probably or potentially have some impact on your, on your fourth quarter? Thank you. 
Uh, well, I, I think in Germany, we see super strong, as you understood ecommerce in particular inaudible and, and, and that area as well. 
Uh, in terms of COVID, yes. 
I mean, y- y- you're right that on the fact that, um, eh, in the third quarter, there was still frustration in Germany more than in the other geographies. 
There is an index crosstalk Stringency-… the Stringency Index that is quite telling 
from this point of view. And Germany was across Europe, uh, as a country, we 
still, uh, uh, uh, still, uh, uh, restrictions and, uh, I was there two weeks ago. And you could really feel it. 
I was there with Bernardo. You could really feel it, uh, from the smaller things. Hotels, uh, to the more visible ones. 
And, this is actually, as we said before, affecting, in particular, I would say, the LAKA sector. The larger merchants where we have, uh, uh, as I said, still an 
important portfolio straddling the industry. 
Uh, and, uh, I would say there are two angles that are particularly relevant that are, are, are kind of intersecting between, uh, uh, international travelers coming in and business travel more, more broadly. 
And, 
uh, uh, and, uh, as you can imagine, while in places like Italy, you have a huge amount of, uh, uh, inbound from tourists. 
Uh, so, international has tourism. In the summer, 
don't have that many people are going to Germany, uh, to enjoy the summer. It's actually, the other way around. So, the traffic there is much more business, uh, related. And this is still, uh, uh, uh, suffering. 
But again, I said that we see, we have seen good recovery also there. 
Um, listen on w- what is happening these days, difficult to comment honestly. Uh, 
I think we need to understand exactly what will happen in terms of measures. Was reading before coming, the new news before coming into this, into this call 
about cases growing, uh, 
uh, again. But at the same time, the measures that we're thinking about 
implementing were not really comparable to real inaudible and stuff like that. I think it was talking about asking the green pass 
to, to enter in certain places like, uh, restaurants or clubs and stuff like that, which is something in Italy is already happening. 
So, let's, let's see. I think, uh, it's really, uh, uh, probably, uh, too early to see, to say. 
I think the good news is that, uh, 
uh, we're more or less the percentage of people with vaccine are, uh, uh, are now more 
high and, and therefore, that 
with cases increasing the impact on the health of the people is, uh, is more limited than before, hopefully, the need for registrations. 
Thank you very much. The next question is from Hanneson Lightner with UBS. Please go ahead. 
Uh, yes, thanks for letting me on. A couple of questions also from my side. 
Um, maybe on, on the partnership strategy, uh, with ISB, maybe you can talk a little bit about the economics there. And then also is there geographic, uh, kind of, uh, 
statistics around what is currently 
served by, by those partners, 
um, especially then maybe also breaking it down between in-store and online. 
And, and then maybe you can give, uh, more color on ecommerce growth for the group. 
Um, you have stated here, E-commerce revenue growth. But it would be helpful to understand also the, 
the transaction volume growth. 
And then, just in general, did you see throughout the quarter, as it developed, um, some shifts between in-store and ecommerce? 
That's it. 
Hi, Hanneson. Thank you for, uh, your, uh, uh, questions. 
Uh, um, so, uh, l- let me start from the first one in here. Uh, uh, uh, maybe you can follow up more, uh, 
more, uh, precisely. In general, as I said that, the, these partnerships, uh… I mean they're happening, I would say, in inaudible geographies. And probably they're actually a bit more new 
to Italy even if we are very active, uh, uh, are happening with two type of, uh, uh, players. 
Uh, the ones that are… and obviously, it really depends on geography. And, and let me give you inaudible in case it is probably, uh, more, uh, uh, closer one. 
If, uh, you take, uh… in Italy, you have two type of, uh, players. You have the ones that are coming from the inaudible systems. 
They are keen not to, uh, 
integrate, uh, uh, payment inaudible across merchants from all possible industries. Something that probably more specialized for certain industries. 
And we are partnering with inaudible partnerships with, uh, the two super, uh, 
uh, super key ones. 
Uh, the, uh, the, at the same time, you have a bit more on, uh, uh, development with the ones that I would call, vertical ones. Uh, uh, 
I don't know. I give you an example, pharma inaudible that is serving pharmacies, just to mention, uh, just to, just to mention, uh, uh, one of them. 
But, uh, we're really talking about… I mean, in Italy, you're talking about statistics. We have 48 of these partnerships today. Uh, 
Denmark more than 100. Sweden more than 100. Norway almost 100. Finland more than 100. Germany more than 100. 
And, and, so on and so forth. So, there are many, many of those. And economics vary a lot depending on, uh, what is the relationships, something that, uh, uh, the Spanishes are more technical integration. So, there is not 
a very specific, uh, uh, uh, economic partnership. In some other cases, 
like the one I was mentioning before. Instead, you have a go-to-market initiatives. You invest together. You go to market together. 
And you share the benefit, uh, uh, uh, together. 
So, very, very different situation. But also, involving, uh, uh, in an important, uh, uh, in an important, uh, uh, way. 
Um, as far as inaudible maybe on ecommerce volume learning and growth, you can comment, Bernardo, on the, on the shift, uh… these are more a 
political question. But it's a very important question. 
The thing is inaudible over the last, uh, uh, uh, I would say, few quarters, uh, we have not seen any further 
acceleration of ecommerce 
in terms of, uh, people moving even more from, uh, uh, from, uh, uh, physical to ecommerce. 
If anything, you have that some sectors, uh, uh, the direction, uh, uh, the opposite direction. 
And therefore, people are keen to go out and shop again in the physical world. Uh, uh, 
I guess, uh, 
uh, uh, obviously because now stores are, are open again. But more in general people being keen to go out and socialize and, uh, and, and, and buy in, uh, uh, in real places. 
I think that the, I mean the trend 
to more ecommerce remains, uh, remains there. But, uh, it's interesting because some of the acceleration that we've seen when COVID started, this 
period of COVID 
now is, is going down a, a, a bit in certain cases, 
uh, uh, inaudible a little bit. And in general, the trend is continue. 
Bernardo, you want to comment on- Ecommerce? Yeah. Yeah, sure. We saw that revenues grow, uh, you know, in the third quarter, grew 36, 37%, if I remember correctly from the slide we had in the, in the document. 
Volume growth was actually approximately 13%. You see it on Slide 10 of the, of the document. 
Within this clearly, SME, uh, uh, are growing. LAKA suffers from the fact that LAKA has an ecommerce component, including travel high impact, which, uh, you know, has caused it actually to, 
uh, to, um, shrink in the quarter. 
So, if you look at, uh, LAKA without, uh, without, um, without the, the high impact, it's actually grown 9%. 
Overall, ecommerce volumes, as I said, are growing 13%. And it's, uh, a mix of, uh, both. 
Okay, so, it's about 25 billion, uh, ecommerce revenue, uh, volumes in, in Q3? Uh, approximately crosstalk yeah, for the group. Okay. Okay. Thank you. 
The next question is from Sandeep, uh, Deshpanda with, uh, JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Thanks for letting me on. I didn't hear all the questions. So, please excuse me if some of this was asked before. 
Uh, uh, in your, uh, uh, Nordics or in your overall business, you're saying that, uh, the LAKA accounts are lagging behind the recovery compared to the SME accounts. 
We have seen, uh, quite a different effect that players like Adyen. Maybe you can explain why, uh, Nexi is different in this regard, especially. 
And then, secondly, is, is there an explanation why you think that, uh, the, the, the inaudible are lagging so much behind in terms of 
the account, the, the recovery in terms of the volumes and thus the revenues as such? 
Thank you. Hi, Sandeep. Thank you for, for the questions. Listen, on LAKA, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the dynamic that we're observing is very much driven by the industry needs. 
Uh, and it's very, very clear. 
I mean, in, uh, i- if you inaudible from, uh, from, uh, the high impact sectors like, uh, uh, airlines, to use 
a typical example or, or travel agencies and so on and so forth, the overall volumes are growing 9% compared to pre- COVID levels. 
Actually, even more so, uh, in, uh, places like, uh, uh, like, uh, like Italy. 
And you have growth coming back despite the fact that, uh, there is still some, uh, uh, similar situations around. 
And I think the different dynamic that you observe, uh, with Adyen is probably driven by two elements. Number one is that they're less exposed to traveler sectors. I think more broadly. 
Uh, and number two, you should also consider the fact that they're actually entering new markets and expanding further. 
Uh, 
the, the, if, if, uh, uh, if you are pointing precisely on the, on the relative dynamics with a player like them, I, 
I go back to what I said before. Clearly, you know, Adyen is a very strong player that we, uh, immensely respect to be very, very clear. 
Uh, uh, the company continue to see them successful when they play on global merchants with global CRM systems integrated with a lot of alignment more limited in store. 
And we continue to be successful also against them. 
Instead, you have more local regional merchants, more local integrated, 
uh, that require local assistance and require more specialized solutions and more customized solutions and so on and so forth. 
Uh, when it comes to DAKA, DAKA, uh, is, uh, is two, ha- ha- has two elements 
that, that explain the dynamic there. And I think it's very visible when you go to page, uh, uh, 
uh, page 8 of the presentation where you have, uh, the volumes for DAKA by, by macro sector. 
And, as you can see there, on the one side, 
uh, uh, there is a mixed effect. And, and, the mixed factor 
has to do with the fact that Nexi, no not, not, uh, not, not Germany per se, but Nexi, 
uh, uh, was more exposed and it's been more exposed in terms of mix of sectors to the high-impact sectors, 
in terms of volumes. And inaudible in terms of volumes, uh, uh, to travel and airlines in particular. 
Uh, these exposures been diminished over time. But still, is a 
relatively high exposure and it's a mixed effect, uh, in Germany when you look 
at, uh, uh, the other sectors instead, 
now you see a very strong performance in, uh, in, in the building/construction, growing anywhere around 30, 30% -plus versus 2019. 
And also, the, uh, the more discretionary, 
uh, products and services sectors. Uh, uh, uh, coming back to growth. On page 9, on the right, you see some very visible examples of sectors growing double digit, uh, in that space as well. So, I, 
I would say, it, it's more driven by the exposure to travel in the mix. 
I'd say also, Paulo, the Italian SMEs were under-penetrated. I think there's, uh, structural under-penetration there which is, we're now closing the gap. Yeah. 
Thank you. The next question is from Mohammed Muawala with, uh, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Yes, uh, good afternoon. Hi, Paolo. Hi, Bernardo. I had a couple as well. 
Uh, so firstly, just, you know, coming back to sort of the progression in, in the back end of the year, 
uh, given the easy comparisons and I think you kind of broadly, broad-based core Nexi 
and core 
Nets. Um, is a kind of essentially your guidance being perhaps a bit more prudent and conservative. And if so, what was the kind of thinking behind that prudence. 
Um, and then secondly, a question around, um, again, on, on sort of competition. 
And, and here, I just want to nuance it a bit, bit more in that, um, there's clearly an appetite for larger merchants to take kind of more traditional omni-channel. 
But we also see the likes of sort of Adyen, um, moving in with a kind of platform approach to address the longer tail of the mid-market. 
Now what's your sort of strategy to sort of compete against that? And I kind of nuance that further, you know, the Nordics is a fairly well-penetrated market. 
Um, and you know, we have a, you know, a number of kind of digital first players there. 
So, what's your sort of strategy to, to perhaps defend your position or even kind of grow your, your business there? 
And then the last one for Bernardo, when we look at the kind of EBITDA performance, this was quite strong. 
Um, in terms of sort of the synergy realization at Net, it seemed like there was mid-teens type, uh, cost-savings. 
Could you give us a bit more color around where those savings came from? And as we, as we go forward, 
um, what's kind of the path and, and what are the kind of levers in terms of the synergies, 
uh, that you expect to extract to sort of hit, uh, uh, the, the milestones for the, um, uh, the next kind of payout, uh, to, uh, to be achieved? Thank you. 
Hi, Mohammed. Thank you for, uh, different questions. I will cover the second. And then I will endeavor to, uh, inaudible very good question. 
Eh, let me try to 
inaudible. Uh, uh, first of all, LAKA as you understood for the Group is, uh, is about 5% of it. That's more than 
10% of total, uh, uh, revenues. Uh, it's about 9 
in total uh, uh, transfer is about, uh, uh, 64%. So, we're talking about more or less 5% of total the begin with. 
Nevertheless, inaudible opportunity, uh, for the new Nexi, in particular. 
Uh, and to be clear, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, the competition, uh, uh, from, uh, players like Adyen is there. 
Uh, uh, as I said before, they are very good. They're more focused on certain markets than others. And I'm sure, 
uh, they, uh, will try to move a bit more into, uh, into markets, uh, uh, on, uh, uh, smaller, uh, players. 
At the same time, 
no, I think the good news is that, uh, in those markets, uh, the markets we're represented, we're very inaudible and we're actually investing to build stronger, 
uh, uh, in, in, uh, uh, in the camp of omni-channel, uh, uh, products and services, omni-channel integration and analytics capabilities. 
Uh, uh, and, and, and, and that will continue. So, you will see a nice competitive dynamic where they will probably try 
to do it. And we will defend our turf on the back of being local but also sca- scaled up and for being able to invest, 
uh, in, uh, uh, new products and services. 
At the end of the day, if you wish each one of the two of us, uh, 
is, uh, uh, uh, strong and weak at the same time based on our strategies. 
In the sense that the key strength of places like Adyen is the one platform, uh, uh, theme, uh, uh, that has many positives 
but also a lot of limitations when you have to start playing with the smaller players, more complex players, more integrated players, 
uh, uh, merchants that don't have integrated CRNs that are less sophisticated, that require a lot of inaudible care and so on and so forth. 
Our position is the other way around. Uh, it's true, no, we are more complex 
in terms of, uh, uh, our technology set up inaudible and so on and so forth. But at the end of the day, 
uh, uh, makes us quite effective in serving, uh, the local needs in being closer to the customers, being able to integrate effectively 
with their needs. And, 
for example, segmenting by industry more effectively for what is relevant locally. So, 
I think we continue to see this dynamic in each one of the two us will do, uh, uh, it's best. I think the good news is that in many cases it's a market that is growing. 
I'm sure that there will be space for Adyen. There will be space for places like us and customers will choose depending on what is the prevailing need, uh, that they, that they have. 
Bernardo, inaudible? Yeah, so, 
it's I think, uh, going back also, um, I think James asked a similar question earlier on. So, I can only go back to what we said earlier. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter in terms of top-line growth. And that, you know, 
I think, 
um, with regards to the, 
the, the degree of prudence in this, we won't comment on that. Our guidance is our guidance. We're committed to deliver it. Hopefully, we'll do better. But that's, um, what I'm prepared to say on, on, on that front. 
Um, with regards to, uh, Nets, as, as, as I mentioned earlier, the EBITDA growth in the, in the third quarter for Nets 
was, um, was, um, 19%. 18.8%, if I remember, if I remember correctly, uh, 19%, 
uh, compared to 2020. Uh, 
I expect that to improve in the fourth quarter, uh, of this year. 
I think that's also implicit in what we had said, uh, some time ago. How we were aiming to, uh, to hit an EBITDA for Nets, which, uh, lies within the, 
the, um, within the, the earn-out range for, uh, uh, for Nets was agreed with sellers back, uh, at the end of last year. 
Um, so, this growth in EBIDTA, which is obviously, uh, you know, fueled by, by top-line growth is also aided by the realization of, uh, of synergies, 
uh, within 
Nets. Um, and I think that was your question. Well, because synergies coming from Nexi-Nets integration… well, 
those this year are, I would say, in total approximately €10 million, uh, mostly capex. 
Uh, a small portion of that will be in, uh, our fourth quarter numbers. 
Um, and with inaudible, as I already said, we're targeting €100 million of cash synergies. Uh, from the three 
entities approximately, I'd say 60% of that will be P&L synergies. And the rest will be, uh, capex synergies. 
Okay, great. Thank you. The next question is from Alberto Mila with Intermontecina. Please go ahead. 
Uh, hi. Good afternoon. Thank you, thank you for the presentation. I've just one question is on the, uh, 'Buy now. Pay later, ' uh, business. 
Can you give us some, uh, color on the, 
uh, revenues you are generating in this unit. The, uh, growth you're, you're expecting and if you have any thoughts, eh, on the strategy on this segment going forward. 
If you want to expand it or the exit or, um, what's your thoughts on, uh, on, on the opportunity there. Thank you very much. 
Ciao, Alberto. 
So, um, uh, our strategy in the space, uh, uh, is, uh, at the end of the day, uh, uh, two-fold. Now we are happy to have these assets inaudible. Uh, just to be, 
uh, uh, explicit, this is operating at the moment in Germany. In Germany only with potential to stand, 
uh, uh, as well at some point. And it is 
by now inaudible focused on the merchant side. 
And so, we don't have a consumer-facing strategy like inaudible. The 
inaudible with the merchants that they normally white label and afford really the best possible partner for merchants as well. 
They are, uh, uh, successful. 
Um, the business is growing, uh, very rapidly, depending on the quarter, it's anywhere between 50 and 100%. So, I think last quarter was about 70, 75. 
And it's become a sizeable business. 
We don't provide details of, uh, of, of this. But, 
uh, it's, it's, uh, uh, getting bigger and bigger. So, we're talking about, uh, uh, 10s and 10s of million of Euros, uh, uh, per quarter now. 
The, 
um, the, uh… So, this is one side of the strategy. At the same time, uh, uh, we also recognize the fact that, uh, uh, if you want to, uh, inaudible your core, uh, ecommerce strategy, one of providing great acceptance to merchants, 
uh, uh, you, you 
have to be able to provide uh, uh, the, uh, relevant, the locally relevant inaudible together with other alternative payment methods. 
And, therefore, in our geographies were also offering more and more the possibility to use other no-… so, offering, uh, more and more the possibility to use other, uh, buy now, pay later methods, uh, that, uh, we partner with. 
Um, and ideally, these will continue to be, uh, the way forward. 
Uh, now, uh, um, clearly, uh, uh, uh, as the other way around works as well. 
And therefore, uh, a company like, uh, Ratepay, uh, because it's technically our company, uh, is also partnering with other 
PSPs. So, uh, in, uh, uh, uh, in, uh, uh, in, uh, Germany, they're used by, 
uh, the, the, the audience that will pays, uh, the, the, the DSP ones, uh, uh, and, and the Computops, 
uh, and, and you 
name them. So, uh, uh, at the moment, we have these two parallel strategies. It is very, very, very clear that, 
uh, uh, going forward, we'll continue to partner with more and more, uh, of them, uh, and, uh, uh, uh, we're IP owners of, uh, uh, of these fast growing and sizable, uh, 
buy now, pay later assets. 
Uh, Bernardo, uh, anything else? crosstalk No. Okay. You said it. So, same growth. All right. Yeah. Okay. 
Thank you. Thank you, Alberto. The next question is from Paul Kratz with, uh, Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi. 
Thank you for taking the questions. 
Um, just three questions from my end. Um, 
I think firstly when I look at your Nets figures, um, on the presentation, that excludes, um, volumes from Dankort. 
So, it'd be helpful to maybe give us some color over how kind of the volumes looked including these figures, and if they differ materially, I guess, from what you presented. 
The other thing that I'd also be interested in hearing as well is, on the Giro card side, you know, appreciate the minority of your volumes in Germany, but, 
you know, how have the volumes of the Giro card side trended, 
uh, where, historically, I think you guys have been actually a share gainer in that market, admittedly, off of a re- relatively low base? 
And then, I, I guess the final question is a little bit bigger picture. But when we start thinking about capital allocation of the combined entity, I mean, you guys will be able to de-lever the business relatively rapidly at the current pace. 
I mean, is there any kind of updated thoughts you have around potential M&A, whether that switches maybe more towards e-com? 
Um, maybe looking at assets, for example, like a Computop in, in Germany to maybe strengthen your presence in e-com? Thanks. 
Hi, Paul. Uh, a good mix of, uh, uh, detailed, uh, questions and, uh, and super strategic ones as well. That's just great. 
Um, uh, listen, uh, on, uh, on the first two, uh, I think we'll come back to you with, uh, uh, a bit more detail if it's important to you. 
I think, in general, um, uh, and during the second line, on Giro card, we are, uh, uh, uh, are clearly challenges in that space. Uh, and as far as we want to grow in that space, 
uh, don't forget that, uh, Concardis is coming from, uh, uh, uh, a position where they were mainly acquirers for international schemes, 
a little bit like, uh, what CartaSi was in Italy back, uh, five years ago, six years ago. 
And from there, there, they moved, uh, uh, uh, over the last, uh, year or two into offering the full package. 
So, uh, uh, the terminal and basically acquiring across all schemes including Giro card. So, 
I don't have the kinds of the numbers, but, uh, uh, but clearly, there's a, a space, uh, for, 
uh, developments. Uh, uh, on Dankort, I think we'll come back to you because, honestly, uh, we don't have, uh, a precise, uh, answer. 
Uh, but broadly, instead of capital allocation, coming to the very strategic question, listen, 
uh, uh, our focus re- today is, is really, really, really, 
uh, uh, on, uh, uh, kinda getting, uh, the three companies together, 
delivering the synergies and, most importantly, building a stronger and stronger and stronger company for our customers, our people and our shareholders. 
Um, uh, uh, along the way, as we always said that, you 
know, we'll, uh, continue to consider opportunities. But, uh, uh, uh, uh, it's our duty somehow, 
but we really, really focus on the ones that makes absolute sense, uh, for us. I think what, uh, uh, uh, we've done, uh, uh, with UBI or Alpha Bank is very clear. 
We'll be looking at other stuff where we didn't do for, uh, uh, for, uh, very good reasons. 
Uh, uh, but it was our duty, uh, uh, uh, uh, to look at it. Uh, and 
I think we continue to do so, going, uh, uh, going forward. As you can imagine, we cannot talk about specific, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, cases. 
Uh, um, taking to account the fact that, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, as with the leverage and the, uh, uh, diverse, uh, with the, potentially the rest also assets, uh, that are not core, and so on and so forth, uh, 
I will also consider putting more investments, uh, more organic investments, you know, because, uh, there is always this feeling that, uh, that M&A is easier than massive, uh, organic investments. 
Actually, now, given, uh, where we are as a, as a company given that no 
amateur, uh, we are keen, uh, to invest in geographies, such as Germany or in spaces such as e-commerce. 
Uh, and that is also another important area of investment. So, 
I believe you will see, uh, uh, our portfolio of, of, of those. But really, our focus today is, uh, you know, uh, to deliver in, 
uh, what, uh, we have already committed, uh, uh, to you. 
Um- Sorry. 
Just, um, on, on the- Bernardo is trying to give you a preci- a precise answer on what's- Just for you guys, if we come back to you on those- crosstalk Okay. Let us come back to you before, uh, we give you an answer that, uh- I don't want to give you the wrong answer in there. is not, uh, uh, is not reliable. No, that, that's really fair. 
Thank you very much. Just maybe just one quick followup. 
Thank you, Paul. Yeah. Thank you. Um, is, is on the divestment of non-core assets. 
I mean, how should we start thinking of that? Is that, you know, part of a 
regular portfolio review that you would do on an annual basis, or are we just talking more about, you know, concessions that would come as a result of antitrust? 
No, no, no, no, no. I want to be very clear. I think, thank, actually, thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this. 
On the antitrust thing we, we less to do, 
uh, because it's a, uh, uh, uh, it's a request by the antitrust. But again, it's about the business that is 6 million euro of, 
uh, uh, revenues, probably two or three EBITDA, declining, uh, revenues, because it's 
a legacy business. It's checks and the likes. 
Uh, uh, and so, uh, uh, that has nothing to do with, uh, the business strategy. Uh, uh, I don't even know how much, uh, uh, that is worth. Uh, we are doing our normal work, but we'll be talking about a very, very small thing. 
Uh, uh, instead, what is very much right is the first of what, uh, of the two things you said 
that is an ongoing 
and regular strategic view of our portfolio of, uh, of, of assets 
to make sure that we put, uh, our, uh, uh, resources and focus and energy, uh, work on what is strategic for our future. 
And instead, we let, uh, the other assets, uh, uh, uh, uh, to be owned by better owners, uh, the assets for whom, uh, uh, they are strategic. 
Never forget as a benchmark data, before, uh, uh, doing, uh, uh, uh, even way, before the company was listed, actually, 
we did do, uh, a five or six M&A deal, where we bought stuff. We did do 12 where we sold stuff. 
So, we like to clean, uh, as much as possible, the portfolio and focus, uh, uh, uh, and, uh, and we'll continue to do it. 
And some of the business that we love them, we would love to continue to have them, 
but actually it doesn't make sense for, for them. And, uh, uh, uh, uh, for our service, I think it's very rational. I think it's, we always need to be very rigorous. 
Um, we, we are very, uh, uh, continue to be very, 
very excel. And look at what, uh, for example, uh, also Nexi's, um, when they sold, 
uh, their corporate services, uh, uh, and instant key and services, uh, to MasterCard. By the way, it's a very interesting and attractive, uh, 
uh, valuation. And we will continue to do so. I think it's good discipline. 
Uh, we'll try to give you, uh, uh, an update on these, uh, ideally, in February, together with, uh, the outcomes for the New Year. That's really fair. 
Thank you very much. The next question is from Alexandre Faure with, uh, Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for, um, squeezing me in. Um, I had a couple of questions. 
Um, one is going back on your, um, sort of own, um, alternative payment method, you know, the account to account in Poland or, or Ratepay in Germany. Um, 
I was wondering if you could, um, go back on the economics of its payment method, and whether they're accretive to your, to your tax rate, for instance. 
Um, and as a side question to that, I was wondering, 
uh, if you view them as differentiating factors to win 
wallet shares with, with a given account. You know, have you found yourself in a position where you went to immersion to sell on the Ratepay and you ended up selling, 
you know, uh, a much wider range of services? 
So, that would be my first, uh, two-part question. 
Uh, second question is on Italy, this time. I think where, uh, you mentioned in the past, I guess, quite a bit of appetite, uh, to the digital payments in Italy, uh, at least on the consumer side. 
I was wondering if, if you have your own initiative, um, 
to perhaps lower, uh, acceptance cost, uh, for merchant and, 
and the company has transitioned to digital, the new pricing plans, low cost terminals. 
Uh, any, any specific initiatives you're, you're pushing as we go into 2020? 
Thank you. 
Uh, hi, Alexandre. Uh, so, uh, understand APN is both economics and strategy and, uh, Italy who are doing anything, uh, uh, uh- To lower the cost for merchants. 
in, uh, to lower cost, uh, cost for merchants. Well, listen, uh, uh, let me start from the second one, uh, uh, around Italy. 
I think, uh, uh, uh, the good news for merchants, actually, is that, uh, prices are structurally going down in our sector. 
It, it, it's absolutely normal because, uh, uh, when volumes go up, uh, unitary prices go down. 
Uh, it, it, it's almost, uh, uh, uh, uh, a law of economics, 
see, uh, unless, uh, you have monopolies, uh, or, or duopolies, which is not the case in our industry that is very competitive. 
Uh, the good news is that the combination of, uh, volume growth, uh, uh, uh, and, and unitary prices going down, uh, is positive. Uh, and on top of it, you also have value added service. 
So, prices tend to go down, uh, um, as is, as has always happened. 
Uh, uh, I, the, if you like, uh, the one thing that you're doing more proactively and this is driven by company dynamics, 
uh, is also to, to, to, to design propositions, 
uh, for the merchants which are newer to these, uh, uh, uh, uh, to these, to these products and services, not the typical new 
to 
card, uh, uh, segment. And we are offering a nice, uh, uh, ent- entry levels, uh, almost try, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and that type of situation we believe is important. 
Uh, although, it is not necessarily on the rate 
because, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a customer who is new to card, uh, doesn't know how much do we use. So, for them, the barrier to entry is more the terminal. 
That's where, you know, uh, we, uh, have launched as well, the mobile, uh, POS 
terminal, uh, that, uh, doesn't have a fixed rate per month, but is basically, uh, a small one-off that's depending on the campaign, and so on and so forth, is, 
uh, uh, uh, normally 
below, uh, uh, 50 euros, 49 euro. Uh, uh, but again, with a higher, 
you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, merchant fee, that then, uh, we upgrade the merchant to, uh, uh, uh, uh, to, to, to, uh, uh, a proposition is more suited for higher, uh, 
uh, 
volumes. Uh, when it comes, um, uh, instead, uh, uh, uh, on, uh, the, uh, A- APM methods and so and so forth, 
uh, let me try to give you the overview, and then, uh, Bernardo can, um, can, uh, can help you in comment, uh, uh, uh, uh, a bit better. 
First of all, um, uh, uh, economics, uh, clearly the economics are very different, if you're talking about, uh, APM, that you own, 
you know, or APMs that you distribute and your partner with. 
Huh? Uh, uh, we should distinguish in between, uh, account to account, uh, and the buy now, pay later, uh, uh, for the ones that you own. 
Buy now, pay later has an amazing growth. Uh, uh, profitability-wise, it's actually lower 
because obviously it comes with a certain cost. But here it is very much under control. But it's actually, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, material and, by the way, in this specific case, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Ratepay is also investing, uh, in growth, 
you know, um, as well as every other player in the industry, I'm sure you've seen, uh, the numbers from some of these players, 
uh, uh, and they are quite explicit about it. Actually, Ratepay is profitable, this is good news. But, 
uh, we'll keep on investing, uh, in, uh, growth. 
Uh, account to account is normally more profitable. 
Uh, there is a cost to develop the ecosystem, because it's a two-sided business model. You have to sell it to the consumer and sell it to the merchant. 
Once this ecosystem is developed, normally, it comes with, uh, a nice, uh, uh, variable, uh, variable margin. 
Instead, when you distribute, you can really have any type of deal, to be honest with you. 
Uh, the more you are the one facing the customer and distributing to the customer, 
uh, the better the economic side. If it is just a technical integration, uh, uh, uh, uh, then, uh, uh, uh, uh, your economics as such, uh, are, are, are much lighter. 
But actually, for some of them, uh, the economics are quite compatible with the ones that we have on cards, to be clear, 
you know. Uh, uh, and, uh, I, I, I cannot give you a specific example, because I c- I, I, 
I <laugh> I could, but I cannot, uh, uh, in terms of disclosure. 
But I have in mind at least a couple of examples where economics are, uh, exactly one in Italy, uh, and one in another place where economics are basically the same that we have, uh, on, uh, card. Uh, but on strategy, I think, I think I, 
I'm not sure I understand exactly your question because the communication was not very clean. 
But if, if your question is, uh, how do you guys balance on the strategy, uh, uh, whenever strong APM, uh, do I give it to everybody, 
uh, uh, or, uh, uh, uh, uh, to, to expand it or do I monetize it, uh, uh, by, uh, uh, differentiating myself as, uh, on, on the acceptance side, I think that's a very, very, very relevant strategic question 
that does not have a one answer. Uh, uh, uh, that is always the same by product and by market, 
because it really depends on the specific market, uh, uh, dynamics. 
Uh, uh, but, uh, uh, but, again, uh, if I use the example I said before on, uh, uh, on, uh, on buy now, 
pay later, it's a, it's quite clear, 
you know. And our Ratepay is a buy now, pay later acceptance method, uh, on basically every, 
uh, merchant, uh, uh, uh, merchant, uh, uh, e-commerce merchant, uh, uh, uh, sorry, e-commerce acquirer, e-commerce PSP in Germany. Why? Because we have a lower market share, you know. 
And therefore, uh, uh, if we were leaving it only to us, it will be s- too much a restrictions for the full potential of, 
uh, of the product. Maybe, uh, in another market with a different, uh, starting competitive position and market share, we go in a different direction. 
So, on the margin, 
yeah. Now, so, um, I think we need to distinguish, as Paolo did, the three in account to account and, and BNPL. Starting with BNPL, we should really think of it is a different, uh, a different product, different, different business. 
So, in terms of the margin accretion or the take rate accretion, uh, it really depends where you cut the P&L, because it's, 
uh, there is a, a, a cost of risk element there that you have in, in BNPL, but not in account to account. 
Um, so, take rates would be higher. But then, if you go to the very bottom line right now, obviously, as you've seen in, uh, some of the other larger listed also players in the, 
in the BNPL space, uh, you have, uh, uh, you have the cost of risk element that you need to take into account. 
Uh, whereas, the account to account, I think in terms of top line, you should think of it as being priced in the various geographies in which it's present, more similar to domestic, uh, rails. 
But, uh, depending on how lean or efficient they are with the margin being similar to what a, uh, a card acquirer could be, uh, in that same 
market. So, uh, in terms of margins, it shouldn't be diluted. Got it. 
Thank you. Thanks very much for the, for the color here. 
The next question is Simonetta Chiriotti with, uh, Mediobanca. Please, go ahead. 
Uh, hi. Good afternoon. Uh, just a quick question on, uh, synergies. Uh, um, during the presentation of the first half 
results, you mentioned the possibility of increasing synergies by 10% in the long term. 
Uh, is it something that you are, uh, still considering, uh, possible? 
Thank you. So, Simonetta, the, the, the, this is our, uh, is our short answer. Yes. 
<laugh> Good. <laugh> Uh, it might make you upset. Uh, yes, absolutely. I mean, uh, we, uh, uh, uh, as we're, we're, we're finding better and better plans. Uh, that's the reason why last time we gave you 
these highlights. Uh, this time, we're giving you, uh, our outlook for next year. 
Uh, we will continue to do it. We will continue to update, uh, uh, the more, uh, we have, uh, visibility. To be honest with you, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, it goes, it goes in phases, in the sense that we have, uh, ob- obviously, when we get close to deals, uh, we had our own view 
that was, uh, outside-in, uh, on the opportunities. Then as we're closing the deals, uh, we do our first round of inside-out, uh, view of the opportunities, 
uh, in the long term. And then, we go into the more year-by-year detailed plans. 
So, this is a little bit what is happening. We'll continue to keep you updated. But the short answer is, yes. 
Thank you. The next question is from Antonin Baudry with HSBC. 
Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon, uh, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Uh, two, if, if 
I may. Um, I, I would li- um, I, I would like to, to, I, I would want to, to have your view on the current macroeconomic environment, and especially inflation. 
Um, we see inflation coming in the US and certainly in Europe soon. So, how do you see inflation impacting your re- revenue growth? Uh, 
I mean, your revenue is directly related to value of transaction, at the same time inflation could decrease the number of transactions. So, how do you, how do you see inflation 
on your, your revenue growth? 
My second question is about, uh, 
uh, uh, M& A. Uh, I, I, I, uh, understand that your focus will be to, to integrate the, the two acquisitions we did, but 
how you consider evolutions of your model, uh, to address adjustment segments like, uh, business-to-business payment, for example? Thank you. 
Hi, Anthony. Uh, let, let me take, uh, the second one in a minute. And then, uh, I, I'll pass over to Bernardo because I, I'm a poor engineer and economist, so I cannot probably give you <laugh> 
much more, uh- That's right. insightful, uh, for what we're looking at. So, 
uh, the, uh, on a, on a, uh, uh, on M&A, I think here, 
uh, uh, 
we will ever to remain focused not only on what we do, but also what we consider, because also re- 
uh, and screening, uh, opportunities, we're engaging in processes that, that might sell from organizational costs. 
And, uh, we are trying to stay as much focused as we can. Uh, I, I, uh, I, 
I reiterate probably what we sa- I said that, 
uh, uh, in, uh, in, uh, in, in, the past, the two, uh, key areas of focus, uh, for us, uh, where we engage and remain, uh, uh, uh, 
uh, uh, our priorities remain at the end of the day in merchant. 
Uh, I mean, first of all, it's mainly merchant services, you 
know. Uh, first one being, uh, merchant books, especially, you know, in the markets, where we're already in, on relationships that we already have because 
for us, it's important to follow our banks and other strategies and partner with them. Uh, and this is what we've done, for example, on, 
uh, on, uh, on, uh, on Ruby on Alpha Bank as well, 
uh, and, and so on. And secondary is more broadly e-commerce, 
both in terms of geographies and also, uh, our capabilities. 
Uh, uh, uh, and, and if you wish, as an extensions of these, you could also consider this wo- world of, uh, uh, uh, software, uh, that can be effectively integrated with payments. 
Uh, and these are small example of all the broader, is a, uh, is a, is a nice one. That does not mean that we go after, 
uh, uh, many of those, necessarily. Uh, uh, uh, we will, uh, 
base it very, very carefully, uh, and we really want to understand it before. 
Uh, we did also, because like you're in a position wherein market 
partnerships are, are also very good. Uh, and, uh, and, and therefore we want to learn more about, uh, about our business. But 
clearly e-commerce and, uh, uh, uh, e-commerce merchant channel and the merchant books, uh, for us are the key areas. Bernardo? 
On occasion as well, uh, thanks, Paolo, for the economist, <laugh> but I give you my 10 cents worth. But I don't believe Europe will, 
uh, will, uh, will, uh, will, will definitely lag the US and probably not have such, such a steep increase in inflation, even though it's lingering. 
Um, I, our view, or my view, uh, is that our business is actually geared to benefit from, from inflation, as you were saying. 
Two-thirds of our revenues are volume driven. And most of that comes from the value of the transaction. Conversely, our cost base is predominantly fixed. And obviously, there may be some wage price inflation. Europe tends to be secure or more resilient than, than the US on that front. 
Uh, but that should give us some protection. But more importantly, we pay, 
uh, our processing cost on a per transaction basis. So, we'd have a nice spread between, uh, revenues growing because of volume growth, thanks to inflation, and as you were suggesting, 
lower transaction numbers, 
um, uh, with lower core processing costs. 
Um, in addition, on the, 
on the, um, on the capital structure front, I mentioned it earlier, I think two, three quarters of our capital base is, or, or, our fi- you know, our, our, our fixed income capital base is, 
uh, uh, effects to be, effectively fixed rate. So, uh, you know, an inflationary pressure should deflate the value of this debt, so beneficial to us. 
Uh, and in the very short term, um, uh, I think it's 1.5 billion of our liabilities are indexed to your LIBOR, but, uh, your LIBOR is scored at, at zero. 
And therefore, we have some absorption capacity, and that's, uh, built into our debt structures, overall. And net-net, my take is that, 
um, you know, we're net beneficiaries of any inflationary pressures. Thank you.

Mr. Bertoluzzo, there are no more questions registered at this time. Do you, do you perhaps have any closing comments? 
Well, uh, thank you. I think, uh, that's a, that's a simple, uh, comment. Thank you for, uh, uh, for being with us. Thank you for the many 
important questions, uh, uh, uh, across, um, uh, uh, across, uh, numbers, uh, outlook, uh, and strategies as well. I think it's important, 
uh, to have always set that at the core, uh, as well. 
Again, simple messages for us, uh, continuing the volume recovery across all geographies. I think this is really important, 
strategically, not just, uh, uh, uh, financially for us. A good, strong, uh, in financial performance, um, uh, uh, uh, across the board, uh, in ratings and, uh, and, uh, um, margin as well. And last but not least, we continue to progress, 
uh, in, uh, the group coming together to have a stronger company for the future across the board. 
So, thank you very much. And, uh, looking forward to see many of you, uh, over the next, uh, few days and week, and hopefully, 
uh, uh, uh, in person. And, uh, uh, and, and it's great to see that some of the meetings, I understand, will be in person, uh, uh, again. 
Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of the day.
