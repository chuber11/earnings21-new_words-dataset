foreign language Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give you a warm welcome at the 
conference, uh, on the financial results of both, uh, group and the company, uh, Polska Miedz inaudible. 
It's, uh, uh, for the first half of 2021. 
We, uh, meet together mainly, uh, through video, uh, 
broadcast, uh, but I would also like to, uh, welcome all of those who came in person to the Warsaw Stock Exchange. 
We'll start traditionally with, uh, Management Board's comments on the results for the first half of the year. And then we will move on to the Q and A session. 
Now, we will answer questions asked both here in the room and, uh, the one's that you send, uh, by 
chat IR, um, @kghm, 
dot, uh, com. If, uh, there are any questions that, uh, we, uh, won't be able to answer today or questions that will require more detailed answers, 
we will, uh, answer them in a more detailed manner on our website and you will be able to, uh, find all the answers, uh, there. 
The results of, uh, KGHM in the first half of the year will be presented by the Management Board, uh, in its almost full composition, Marcin Chludzinski, President of the Management Board, and 
Adam Bugajczuk, Vice President for Development, 
Paweł Gruza, Vice President for assets, Foreign Assets, 
and Andrzej Kensbok, uh, Vice President for Financial Matters. 
We do not have here Dariusz Swiderski, um, but we will also address production matters, uh, and too, the ones related to our national domestic operations. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give the floor to President, uh, Marcin Chludzinski. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you on this still summertime afternoon. We have over… We already passed 12:00. 
We have a few, uh, pieces of good news about the operations of the company in the first half of 2021. 
I think that the figures, um, of, of today's meeting are 132 and 433. Why these numbers, 
100%, uh, higher, um, year on year a- adjusted EBITDA, 30% higher revenues, 
433% higher net profit, 
if we, um, make reference to the first, uh, half of, uh, 2020. 
Plus, uh, what we experience in macroeconomic space. 
And, uh, the recurring comment is that, uh, corporate prices were favorable to us. 
I cannot deny that. For the first time in quite a while… Actually, this is the first year when, 
uh, we have tailwind around the, 
of an, uh, have to struggle against the wind. 
The prices in the first half of the year were very difficult, 
even, uh, the prices, uh, below 5,000 per ton. 
Twenty, uh, ' 18, and 2019 were not, uh, uh, very favorable to us either, 
but, uh, corporate prices is not the only, or not the main reason why we can share those good numbers with you today. 
We implemented a number of, um, optimization initiatives, and we can see the results. In the context of Sierra Gorda, 
uh, comes another good number. 
And I think that's very relevant here. This is the first year where money is flowing not from Poland to Chile, but from Chile to Poland. 
So we are facing a situation where about 500 million, uh, came back from Sierra Gorda to Poland, 
and that's not the end of it. 
The next amounts, uh, are planned for this year, 
so will not end with, uh, this number if good production parameters continue, good financial parameters continue, 
but, uh, should become reality. 
Of course, this happened much later than we had planned it would, 
uh, when we started this investment. But three years of very intense work of the Management Board and, uh, people who are responsible for Sierra Gorda, 
both Polish people and Chileans, 
uh, that are, and in the headquarters of the company, uh, inaudible… 
In spite of, uh, lower prices, we were able to show you much better financial results, uh, improvement on EBITDA, improvement of production volumes. 
And, uh, the battle for this project in terms of cost, in terms of full organization of production capacity, all that is, uh, bringing results. The price, uh, 
does support us, but even without this favorable price, we could see, 
uh, the positive impact on our financial results. 
Maybe that will sound like an anecdote, 
uh, but, uh, there were quite a few examples like this, where several dozen costs, uh, 
uh, more, uh, m- m- inaudible that, uh, uh, um, carry out, but, uh, to the mill, 
and give us, uh, uh, specific, uh, measurable results. Because that, uh, at the end of the day, means more copper. 
That was just one of the, the many optimization initiatives. 
Uh, and again, uh, this is not the end of our initiatives, uh, in this regard. 
Most importantly, this is happening without any new, major new, capital expenditures. 
Uh, we, uh, basically only optimize what we had previously. And we try to, 
uh, create value based on what we have already invested. 
Uh, we trying to increase the value of our assets to improve the financial result. 
By the way, we are trying to do exactly the same thing in Poland, uh, in terms of cost, in terms of maintenance of our production. 
We all know perfectly well that grade 
is, uh, not, 
uh, favorable as time, uh, goes on. Uh, the content of copper is decreasing. 
And Sierra, n- uh, operates in a cyc- in cycles, uh, occasionally we encounter greater contents. 
And in mining industry worldwide, uh, that's, uh, m- one of the, uh, the, um, deposits, uh, with lower content, uh, um, m- uh, the ore. 
So that's not a, a project, uh, 
that, uh, um, brings, uh, those results on its own. We have to combat to get them. 
So we are happy when we are getting those results. We also happy that for the first time in, uh, a long time, macroeconomic conditions, uh, support us. 
They are uncertain, and we also have to admit openly that, uh, there is an ongoing battle in the market, uh, um, in terms of price. 
Sometimes, uh, we can see, uh, um, declining prices and then there are intense efforts to push it up. 
This is something we are monitoring closely. We are prepared for a number of various options. 
Also, as, uh, past year, uh, 
uh, showed, uh, we are ready for crisis scenarios. And, uh, in spite of those crisis conditions, we are able to show good financial results. 
As regards, uh, specific, uh, financials, these will be presented by m- uh, individual members of the Management Board. Now, I would like to, uh, give the floor to Andrzej Kensbok, 
who will tell us about production, uh, figures, but also, uh, financial data. <silence> 
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would also like to give a warm welcome to everyone h- present here, uh, by our broadcast. 
Ladies and gentlemen, as we got production results, 
metals, uh, show an increase, uh, eight copper, 8.6% up, uh, six months to six months. 
Uh, we can, uh, say that this growth is recorded in all segments in Poland. 
Uh, KGHM International, that is mainly Robinson, and, um, Sierra Gorda. 
As, regards, uh, the production of our two other products, that is silver, 
it is slight lower than last year. 
And that, uh, results from the fact that we, 
particularly in Poland, we process more, um, m- uh, foreign concentrates w- with a slightly different type from the one that we processed last year. 
Therefore, with a higher content of copper, but not necessarily with higher content of silver. 
So availability of silver and, uh, um, uh, u- third party concentrate, uh, is, uh, slightly lower. 
And we got, uh, North American mines, 
we are getting through areas that contain slightly less, uh, um, uh, precious metal inaudible. 
We should also say a few words about the results of, uh, Polska Miedz as, uh, as the, uh, main holding company in the group. 
Here, I would like to, uh, um, bring your attention to the maintenance of, uh, the level of mining output. 
Uh, this is important because we know that the mining conditions are deteriorating. 
We operate in increasingly difficult geological conditions, uh, getting deeper and deeper, on a more extensive area of the mine. 
But the, uh, the output level was maintained, and even slightly exceeded from, uh, the first half of 2020. 
So, the initiative that w- link to 
making, uh, that deposit available, um, extraction, uh, where the functioning of the entire mining complex, transportation, processing, and so on and so forth, 
all that functions smoothly. And, uh, um, we are able to cope with the situation. Production of electrolytic, uh, uh, copper increased. 
And, uh, that increase, uh, stemmed from, uh, greater processing third-party input, scrap, uh, 
and third-party input. 
We are also expanding the range of third-party input, uh, 
trying to adjust the capacity of inaudible to greater 
opportunities of choosing and optimizing the purchases of third-party input. 
On the other hand, uh, inaudible also adjust that technology to be able to process, uh, those increased quantities. 
We are preparing for that by building, uh, storage centers, warehousing centers, and all the supporting logistics to transport 
third-party input. 
That is becoming a significant element of our production. 
And it helps us because it gives us an opportunity to fully utilize, uh, the, uh, capacity for, uh, inaudible w- uh, 
push up our volumes. 
Decrease in, uh, the electrolytic copper production from our own input, uh, results only from a year on year comparison. 
Uh, in the middle of last year, we were still processing the remains, 
uh, of the surplus, uh, that we had accumulated before. 
And at the beginning of 2020, we still processed that previous surplus. And we have slightly higher, 
uh, processing of our own input. Now, we are running on an ongoing basis, uh, just whatever is extracted, 
uh, is, um, subsequently processed. 
As for production results in Sierra Gorda, we'll, uh, give the floor to my colleague. 
Thank you, Andrzej. Ladies and gentlemen, the results on our foreign asset, in particular, Sierra Gorda and Robinson are very good. 
You can see, uh, hear those numbers that we are very proud of. 
Th- this is, uh, the effect of both good management of the mine and 
of, uh, um, processing plants in Sierra Gorda. 
But also, it, uh, results from our good relations with trade unions. We managed to sign, um, the agreement at the very early stage. 
Uh, and that allowed us to work, uh, in, uh, calm conditions in spite of the turbulent moment that, uh, Chile is going through right now, 
Chile and the mining companies operating under their jurisdiction. 
I would also like to mention 
the financial results and, uh, and, uh, if you would, to what, uh, the president said regarding, uh, repatriation of cash from Chile to Poland. 
Uh, last year, we managed to, uh, maintain, uh, uh, financial supplies, uh, um, uh, from Poland. 
And this year, thanks to good production, thanks to the fact that the first time are being supported… 
Uh, we at the time, of, of this, of this Management Board, we are being supported by the macroeconomic situation. 
We can see the possibility of reversing this financial 
vector, um, uh, which now points back, uh, towards Poland. And we are very happy about it. Thanks to cost savings, 
which, 
uh, uh, we, uh, were able to implement, the price went, uh, down to very low levels, below 5, 000 per ton. 
Uh, we were able, uh, in Sierra Gorda, in our foreign assets, uh, implement those, uh, savings. 
Uh, and, uh, thanks to our discipline, uh, the savings continue also this year. As a result, this year we generate a financial surplus, which is then, uh, brought back to Poland. 
With regard to KGHM International, we can boast 
excellent production results 
of Robinson, which is also working on the extension of its, 
uh, uh, LOM, uh, plan of, planned life of the mine. 
And that, uh, generates a value of assets on our books. 
Thank you. foreign language 
So speaking of, um, our financial performance, 
uh, let me start with the revenue. 
The revenue of the capital group, we're up, 
um, 42% on a year to year basis. 
And it is important to say that we have seen that, um, growth across all the segments of our business. 
The main driving factor was, um, um, u- price increase for all the metals that we sell. 
W- the exchange rate, uh, of złoty against US dollar was working against us. And u- u- złoty depreciated against the US dollar. That has a negative impact on our financial performance, 
so we have, uh, actually experienced some adverse, um, effect of exchange rate. 
Uh, the volume was down by 388 million, 
and this is due to the logistics of sales. 
So first, we have to accumulate, uh, goods before we sell different batches. That happens in the US and in Poland, 
um, for, um, silver. 
So this is, um, a temporary arrangement. 
We simply have to stock up… We had to stock up some products, uh, before the 13th of June when we were closing the books for the quarter. 
U- u- it's a negative result on our derivatives, 
is, 
um, is 
the u- u- uc- it is, uh, the outcome of our hedging transactions. We adjusted the hedgings, uh, during the first six months of the year 
as much as we could on the market, but, uh, our historical hedging transactions that were depending our position during the, 
um, all-time lows for the copper continue to affect us. 
But this negative, uh, effect is, 
um, uh, w- generously offset by the revenue increase and also another factor that I'm going to address in a second. 
Now, let me turn to the costs, C1 unit cost, which is the cash cost, um, of the production of payable copper. 
O- we can tell that, um, it went up from 1.6 to $1.89 per, um, pound, 
but there's a number of, um, factors that, uh, contributed to that. 
M- first of all, C1 cost was actually going down in Poland, so unit cost in Poland, 
uh, in Polish production, was going down. 
At Sierra Gorda, we also had C1 unit costs, uh falling. 
In Poland, uh, the main thing is the increase of price of silver. In Sierra Gorda, the main driving force was the increased in the production value. 
However, the negative, uh, effect is, um, 
the, um, u- increased, uh, inaudible tax, um, so-called copper tax. 
It is included in C1 cost, and it is calculated based on the price of the copper and the volume that was produced. 
Since the volume is, uh, stable, tha- but the price was up substantially, 
the tax was also much higher. And that affected, uh, our C1, um, cost position. 
Now, the operating result. 
So as the CEO said, um… 
We've seen the increase and adjusted EBITDA- We've seen the increase in adjusted EBITDA by 100% on a year to year basis. 
And again, let me emphasize that we've seen that growth across all the segments in Poland in um, North America and in Sierra Gorda. 
We've also had EBITDA going up in the smaller companies of the group like inaudible etc, they 
are doing quite well, they are not growing at such a 
dynamic rate, but nevertheless, because of that growth, they were able to keep their 
balances in check. And they were able to keep the financial arrangements to their benefit. 
Obviously, this is all driven by increased revenue. 
But I may say that uh, contributors to the EBITDA growth 
to some extent uh, are also related to the fact that we are able to keep the production stable in terms of the cost wherever it's possible, 
I will address the cost of the greater length later. But as a result of this measures, our operating margin was up um, two fold nearly. 
Now, 
the net 
uh, income, the net result of the Capital Group was up to 4,723,000,000 the 

main driving factor was um, again, increased revenue. 
The change in the cost by type uh, is related to the fact that we need to buy more third party or because we have to increase our volume. 
Therefore, the production and progress and products uh, contributed positively to that, and therefore we have seen uh, the growth. 
But an important factor that I mentioned earlier is the very fact that we were part of the Joint Venture Products, 
namely, 
the stable, predictable production. 
And um, the growing prices of copper 
enabled us to um, come up with the revaluation of the loans that were granted to Sierra Gorda. 
And uh, that revaluation showed that the value of loans were up by 1,866,000,000. 

So this is our consolidated profit. 
When you look at the standalone results, uh, we show even higher number there. 
And uh, in that result, we had to include the reversal 
of uh, the previous writers of loans that were granted to other entities that were involved to Sierra Gorda. 
They were not included in Sierra Gorda, in- in the consolidated statements. 
But overall, this is the same outcome so we have better operational 
results of Sierra Gorda we have more predictable revenue and profit and overall the macroeconomic environment is 
much more conducive to our business. 
Now, speaking of costs, the main um, driver for costs is um, much greater 
acquisition of third party or 
but when it comes to the cost by type we are tracking them very closely and um, there are third party services and the raw materials, consumption 
and electricity and other energy consumption. 
This is under control. But there are some other 
price factors that are beyond our control, like the much higher prices of diesel fuel and natural gas. 
And in addition to that, higher prices of ETS allowances. 
We are hedging this positions by this- hedging uh, is not long term- long term, we are not able to hedge ourselves long term. 
Um, our hedging policy works short term and we can see the results and- and on top of it the price of the steel 
was up substantially 
in the general market and we are actually using quite a lot of steel 
in the mining operations and therefore we were impacted adversely by the growing prices of steel. 
But again, let me emphasize that we are tracking the consumption of materials uh, very strictly, and we are tracking the cost of energy. 
Uh, there are no negative deviations, we do have savings and we've provided for savings in our budget. And we are right on target here in line with the budget. 
Now, the next slide shows our cash flow. 
At this point, 
I uh, would like to highlight the negative number that you see there, the negative cash flow, which is related to the change in the working capital. And I've already explained that we had increased inventory, which was a temporary thing. 
It was a technical arrangement. 
And uh, it was mostly inaudible copper, but we had to stock up, we have to stock it up before we um, 
actually prepare ourselves for the smelter um, 
repair, we also had higher stock up of concentrate copper in the port. 
And that was to prepare for the next year. And as a result, we had more ships coming to the port at the same time, all in June. 
So the- it's all coincided in time. 
In addition to that we also had the reduction in our debt factoring. 
The factoring was paid off, since there was no need to- to use it. And we didn't want to incur unnecessary financial expenses. 
Another thing was the acquisition of intangible um, intangible assets. 
So CapEx, it was CapEx for Polish operations. And for international operations, specifically Robinson Mine, 
it was all in line with the plan. 
And the third thing that contributed to that negative number was the pay back of our loan to one of the banks, $450 million, 
we took advantage of the fact that we had uh, free cash 
um, flow, and we didn't want to pay the cost of the debt. And therefore we decided to reduce our debt position. 
So moving on to the debt. 
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
currently, or actually at the end of Q2 was at point 0.7. 
So this is a much better situation than last year. And this is all in line with the policy that we follow 
the net that has been fairly stable. 
But as we indicated here, 
we took advantage of the fact that we had some positive cash flow, 
and uh, we decided to pay back our um, one of our loans and everything else is pretty stable. 
We don't want to keep too much cash because the cash that sits idle 
um, does not generate any income. And we don't want to maintain the excessive debt because this is costly. 
We have an open credit line for 8.2 billion zlotys, and this is um, a very flexible credit line, we have very um, good terms. 
Therefore, whenever needed, we can actually take advantage of that open credit line. 
Our um, financial structure, and our structure of financing is currently um, very optimum. 
We continue to optimize that. And our goal is to avoid financial expenses that are not needed. 
I think that we have pretty much covered our financial performance. So let me turn the floor to Mr inaudible. 
Good afternoon, everyone. And let me walk you through our investment projects and development projects. 
Um, the first six- the first six months, we're close with that CapEx at 1,036,000,000 zlotys on 
the pie charts, you can see the breakdown on the CapEx for the first six months of 2021. 
Perhaps the number is not very impressive, but let me say that our projects uh, are very complex. 
And many times these are our multi annual 
projects. Therefore, we um, like historically the Q4 always shows um, more weight. 
Um, and uh, I just want to assure you, that all the investment projects um, are delivered, according to the plan. 
And this is the 
more and more important role of the deep Glowgov. 
Um, the numbers are quite impressive for the annual growth is over 40% at each stage of operation, 
so, looking at this ratios and looking at this growth, we may mention two things. 
Um, first of all, we have more preparatory work 
completed and we are also actually getting to the mining in that particular area. Therefore, you may expect to see a growing production. 
Now, key um, 
projects, hmm… first of all, the uh, 
tailing um, processing facility at the South is pretty much completed, and uh, all different installations that have been planned 
uh, will be delivered as scheduled. 
Now, that was at acc- that was an access program, we continue to sync GG1 shaft, 
we hit 
1231 meters and for the shaft GG2, we do have a spatial plan- spatial development plan 
already published and now we are actually 
um, moving on with their drill holes. 
And we have also completed our uh, central air 
um, cooling system. This is an important project, it will actually help us 
produce um, at the sections of the deposit where we're not accessible since the conditions of mining where not adequate. 
Now, all the projects related to BAT conclusions are moving on as scheduled both in Glowgov 
and uh, like needs 
aside… we are um, working on the Glowgov One um, 
smelter. Um, and again, the work goes as scheduled. 
Now our energy development program, we move um, two fold. 
We are working on the renewable energy sources but at the same time, we continue to optimize uh, our energy consumption. 
And we have already seen the first outcomes, 
we were able to reduce energy consumption uh, with the same production parameters um, as we used to have. 
And the next slide uh, 
shows how we want to 
reach uh, 50 / 50 split, 50% of energy will be from our own um, generation including renewable sources by 2030. 
As of today, the plan is such that we will uh, switch to this 50 / 50 system. 
And we will save on CO2 um, emission by 900,000 tons 
give or take. 
And by 2030, Sierra Gorda Mine will have 100% of uh, electricity from renewable sources. 
So we have the right data to show. 
Now the next slide shows the photovoltaic farm. And uh, we were able to build that at Legnica Smelter. 
And we also have two other projects at inaudible and Glowgov. 
Uh, the- all the numbers for these investments are shown next to the pictures. 
So all these projects um, have been delivered um, as scheduled. 
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that we are getting to the end of our presentation. 
And maybe as a wrap up, 
I would like to say that it is worth mentioning. 
But obviously we will not uh, rest on our laurels uh, having communicated that there's good news to you. 
Uh, as I mentioned before, we are working on updating our strategy. 
Uh, and hopefully by September we will be ready to share with you the results of our studies. 
But in general, we can say that unless something fundamental changes worldwide, 
we assume that the following years will be the years of copper and silver. 
If that is indeed the case, then we need to produce as much as possible 
with the optimum um, cost level and with uh, the highest sales while taking care of the costs. 
But in order to do that the company needs to transform. 
It needs to transform both in the context of… increasingly restrictive regulations for the energy sector 
and in the context of uh, environment, energy use, 
also in the context of the optimization of processes, uh, the use of new technologies, automation, 
and in the context of securing new deposits 
for further exploration uh, and operation of our business. 
So what we are looking into uh, very closely right now, 
that's actually something you are well familiar with, we have been working on green energy on new energy sources, 
namely, small uh, nuclear reactors as a source of energy, 
hydrogen, which is potentially a very interesting 
uh, source of energy uh, in our sector, also, offshore uh, projects uh, are being considered. 
A big project for us inaudible license that is uh, basically new mind and new technology, a new regulatory environment, 
that is a priority uh, topic for us 
under the license and ports, and potassium salts, but also very promising future oriented subject to the context of the current business cycle. 
All that is the subject of our analysis, we do not fundamentally change our assumptions. 
In um, December uh, 2017, when we uh, develop our original strategy, we have this uh, motto, 
Uncertainty is the only thing that is certain. You have to be ready for all options, but at the same time the company needs to transform in the context of opportunities that open up to it. 
And that is why we are updating our strategy. And that is what we will bring to you in detail in September. 
Thank you. Thank you very much uh, to the management board members for their comments. Now I open the uh, Q&A session. 
This uh, time we have questions both from the room here and from the chat. 
Ir@ kjgem.com, please 
also ask uh, questions uh, here. 
The Q&A session will be chaired by Janusz Krystosiak, head of our Investor Relations uh, Department. 
I can see the first question. 
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, 
inaudible said there, 
I have six questions all together, should I uh, split up by sector? Okay, one by one. 
There will be a few short ones. 
The first, does the company intend to change, adjust its volume guidance for any of the products 
uh, of any- of the metals for the whole 2021? 
Are you talking about production? Yes production. 
inaudible Okay, that was my first question. 
The second, you have mentioned this lower uh, content on international 
uh, so I would like to find out whether and when we can expect any changes in the metal content. 
Uh, if I- my recollection is correct, maybe you're talking about… What do you mean? Content? Grade. Oh, grade, okay. Grade. 
Uh, and another simple question. We have made one offs. 
Uh, does the company intend to maintain its dividend payout uh, at the same level as it paid this year? 
That is, will one off change uh, in next year's dividend or not? 
Then there is um, uh, a beautiful project three megawatt in photovoltaics, 
but my general question is about uh, your strategy. A few years when you showed this strategy, my understanding. Strategy. 
My understanding was, uh, very little has changed to with regard to renewable energy sources. 
So now please do not give us a plan for 2030, that's easy to come up with, 
but a plan for the next two, three years. How exactly Megawatts and Photovoltaics I'm sure you are going to, uh, put up. 
There is one more question 
about progress in the sale of assets. Has there been any progress in your selling of the assets? 
And the last thing which also 
contribute to the results, I would appreciate 
very much a short, but, uh, um, informative, uh, uh, discussion of this component of costs, uh, stock. 
You had it minus 700 and the first and adjustment of costs 
by, uh, stock minus 700 in the first quarter, minus 300 in the second quarter. 
So I would be happy to find out, uh, what is the management thoughts, 
uh, view of what the value might be in the third quarter on the second, uh, half of the year. That's it from me. 
Okay. We'll try to address those questions, uh, quickly now. 
As, uh, for the changes in our production plans, 
excluding, uh, unpredictable events of those related to nature and random events, we do not plan any changes here, 
uh, or in terms of our production. 
As for the grade, uh, lower, uh, uh, rate on international, although maybe you can take it. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the subject you have brought up concerns one of the assets which is, uh, now in the process of, uh, sale. 
So it is, uh, inconvenient for us to discuss it at the moment, 
uh, that, uh, results from the existing geology. 
We are transparent on this point towards the participants of, uh, the, uh, the disposal process. 
Uh, this is being assessed by our 
potential bias, uh, of, uh, those assets. 
And with regard to your second question, I would like to, uh, inform you that the process of, uh, sales of our assets is, uh, moving on as planned in accordance with the procedure that we developed. A transparent procedure that was, uh, communicated, uh, in side our organization. 
We are now at a very sensitive, uh, stage of this process. 
That's why, uh, my constraint in informing you more broadly about this subject. And, uh, 
I think at the end of the year we will be able to present you much more information on the point. 
As regards our approach to dividend next year, it's not going to change. Uh, the dividend policy, uh, remains in place, 
uh, you know that for a couple of years the company did not pay out the dividend. 2020 was the first year for which the dividend was paid after a long break. 
Um, maintaining of the trend, maintaining of the results 
on the current trends allows, uh, us to be optimistic about, uh, dividends. 
Our dividend policy does not change. That's what I can, uh, tell you right now. 
And as for photovoltaic projects, 
it's not just photovoltaics, it is a broadly understood energy optimization. Uh, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, we, um, do not have, uh, already projects, uh, in this field 
so we had to build them from scratch. 
You know the, uh, uh, spacing development, uh, plans, uh, environmental impact, uh, assessment. 
Uh, those procedures are very time consuming. It doesn't take, uh, several months. It, it may take as long as years. 
So the process of placing investments on our land takes time, uh, because the formalities takes, uh, take time. 
We will start one, uh, eight megawatt investment then we will start another of six megawatt and two smaller ones. 
Uh, so, uh, that will be the beginning of the investment process. Once we have gone through the administrative preparation, 
we also have some, uh, vapor and gas, uh, plants, uh, which, uh, helps us improve our energy, uh, management. 
The production process is more intense, uh, and we use eh- less energy. We have lower energy consumption. 
Very soon we will go out to, to the market with an acquisition process, 
uh, um, apart from what we are, uh, working on, we want to acquire processes, uh, projects that are already prepared 
for development. 
So we, uh, we will also have PPA and apart from our own investments, we will have, 
uh, it's, it's, uh, weeks or months rather than years, uh, that we will be an- in the market. 
These are in fact strategic project, if you, uh, make a rough calculation, uh, you will know that, uh, if we relied only on photovoltaics, 
we would have to cover, uh, the area of the three inaudible with our panels. 
So it is not the only source, uh, that we can utilize in the context of 
delivering on the promise of being green in energy. 
So this machine is, uh, going ahead full steam as much as the reality allows us to. 
And, uh, Pavo commented on sales. There was also a question about, uh, 
stock in 
the future. Foreign language- In terms of inventory, a, as I explained the inventory was up for technical reasons. 
We actually, uh, have to stock up, um, more inventory 
since we know that, uh, the modernization program will con- be continued for the next year and, uh, probably two years. 
And that, uh, is mostly the global smelter, therefore this inventory, uh, will be maintained perhaps in a different form. 
And at the same time we also, um, process more third party ore 
and, um, since we work on the third party material, we have to, uh, stock it up first so that it's, it, it is ready for the smelters. 
So this is all technical, and therefore it doesn't affect our performance because this is a repeated cycle. 
And, uh, we've already said that this is, um, also an additional element, uh, like, uh, sales logistics and this is a temporary increase in inventory but, 
uh, tends to go down, uh, during the next, uh, quarter. 
I don't want to predict, uh, when we are going to have it up and down, because it's more related to the shipments cycles for them, 
um, or, or silver concentrate or, uh, rolled, um, material. 
For instance, for Sardinia we had a higher inventory of, uh, rolled sheets because we are getting ready for several weeks of, uh, downtime of, uh, Sardinia smelter. 
Any other questions from the room? 
Well, thank you for all the answers, but if I may, my first question was about the volume guidance for the year. 
As far as I remember, you are way above the, um, plan for mardinium Sierra Garda, 
and you, you said that you are not going to change your, um, assumptions. 
So does it mean that you're going to reduce your production of mardinium dramatically 
or you are just being cautious and, uh, you rather keep a surplus in place instead of, 
uh, facing a different scenario? 
So how should we, um, look at it? 
Um, you think that you will deliver the volume as, uh, actually identified in the guidance or are you actually playing it safe? 
Well, the Sierra Garda budget, uh, is subject to different rules that, uh, our, uh, KGHM in Poland or, um, 
international at, um, Sierra Garda we have to actually come to the arrangements with our partners at the joint ventures every time we work on the budget. 
At this moment we have not had any discussions about any adjustment of the Sierra Garda budget, including the production volume, 
therefore, um, at this point we are not going to come up with any formal position, 
uh, regarding the future production of Sierra Garda during the second half of the year. 
And just to make everything clear, 
it's not going to be less than the, than the Budget, 
unless something unexpected happens, but we always play it safe because as you know, we, um, we are in a business where there are many factors that are beyond our control. 
So, um, we, sometimes we are at the mercy of nature 
and, um, whatever possible we try to, 
um, over deliver if a situation is, uh, conducive and, uh, production situation allows that. 
And to speak about mardinium and Sierra Garda, 
um, production during the first six months of this year was actually, uh, lower than production for the same time last year. 
However, the revenue, sales revenue is higher because the price was up, 
in terms a volume we were down slightly, but, but the revenue was up because of the higher price. 
Any other questions from the room, from the audience? Yes. inaudible could be business alert, um, 
I just want to make sure whether you meant on shore of offshore? This is the question to the 
seal. Whether you're speaking about the strategy update or 
no, you, you said that you are looking at various, um, uh, electricity options. Yes. We are also looking at offshore options. 
Yes. And I also wanted to ask you about the impact of electricity prices on your financial performance. 
And Mr. Kenspok said that the natural gas prices is also, a major factor because the price of natural gas is going up. 
So are you still looking at the, um, gas units 
because we know that, uh, natural gas has a tough in EU, in the EU. And I also have a question about the new deposits. 
Uh, are we going to expect it any time during the comings conference seasons? 
I think that, uh, I addressed the first question already in terms of electricity prices and the prices of the natural gas and the impact of, uh, that on our business. 
I think Andre will provide more detail in a minute, but overall, well, 
the only reasonable response that we can take is long term and this is all about the transfo- um, transformation and transition, 
and there is no other long 
term option 
to actually, um, avoid the increase in the ETS allowances prices that determine at the end of the day the price of, uh, energy. 
So we are trying to, 
um, regroup and we are transforming our electricity consumption and we are trying to optimize consumption wherever possible. We want to come up with the technologies that will allow us to reduce, uh, energy consumption. 
And in terms of, uh, the current developments over to Andre. 
So I'm not sure if I have all the numbers at hand, if not we will, uh, prepare, uh, the answer and send it off to you, 
but speaking of the Polish copper essay, I, I, I because I think that that was your question. 
So the cost of electricity was up by 100, 2 million laries, 70s because of the higher power price, 
77 million up because of the ETS prices 
and, uh, and 90 million up because of the increase in, uh, natural gas and diesel fuel prices. 
So, so this is the, um, breakdown of energy prices. 
And in terms of the gas fired units? 
Well, to be honest, the price, uh, dynamics is not very encouraging, 
um, therefore we are not taking any decisions but we are watching the trend because it may 
change. 
Um, it would be much better if we had more cert- regulatory certainty within the European Union in terms of the natural gas supply from Russia. 
I have to actually add to what I said that we are expecting the, 
um, our capacity fee to go down. 
We know that, um, the increase that we've seen in this, uh, component is not, uh, sustainable. 
Thank you. I think that our CEO has already answered the question of Mr. Verginsky because the cost was also, the question was also about the cost of energy, um, so, um, 
I believe that we have covered this one. 
Uh, any other questions from the audience? Yes. Yeah. Copkaha and bank, uh, brokerage house. 
I have a question about your renewable, uh, energy target at Sierra Garda, 
and I would like to find out what is the current situation and how do you go about it? 
Uh, do you actually have photovoltaics farms or you have a different approach? How are you going to actually develop that? 
Is CapEx going to be, uh, shouldered Sierra Garda or by external partners? And I also have a question about the surplus that you show at Sierra Garda, 
um, are you going to actually continue to transfer that to Poland 
or you really think about, uh, future development like Sierra Garda two, the project that was considered at some time or Sierra Garda oxide 
that was in the plan at some point in time? 
Um, actually as of today, Sierra Garda has some electricity, uh, generated by renewable sources and the ultimate a hundred 
percent target has been adopted because very, um, advantages, uh, contracts that we have signed. 
They are future are, um, forward looking. 
So we are actually looking, we are waiting for this, um, supplier of electricity to complete their product. 
So this is all actually secured, and we are really happy with this, 
um, electricity transition, um, at Sierra Garda. 
And to answer your question about the cash flow from Sierra Garda, 
well at this point Sierra Garda is not planning the second phase, there is no discussion about Sierra Garda two at this point, 
so there is no, um, investment planning towards that. 
We continue the same investment methodology 
that we adopted for Sierra Garda at the very beginning of our engagement there 
when we actually stepped into this, um, function of the management board. So we want to 
optimize the operations, uh, 
while, um, 
containing our, um, financial exposure. 
So this is, um, what we continue to do. 
We do have, uh, CapEx, um, for improvements, um, that are needed. 
Uh, it is not, uh, that we are going to double the CapEx for Sierra Garda or that we want to double the capacity of Sierra Garda, 
no, but we do take a lot of small steps to move forward. 
And, 
uh, despite the CapEx that is dedicated to improvements, we continue to have substantial cashflow to Poland. Final question. 
Um, there is a very, um, new trend of, 
um, electro mobility in the deep minds. Um, suppliers of this equipment are actually talking about it everywhere. 
Have you ever considered that and would it be an option to reduce your energy consumption because you would, 
uh, be able to contain your cost related to ventilation and temperature deduction? I know that one of your companies has such a vehicle in their portfolio. 
So let me, uh, answer that question and Adam Bugita who's responsible for development might provide more details. 
Well, the, 
it is true that there is a trend in place. Uh, I believe that we need time for technology to develop. 
And, uh, many times suppliers are actually, um, speaking, um, much more before for they are able to deliver. 
Because, um, the loader has to lift 12 tons per hour, and it needs a lot of electricity from the battery. 
And it means that it would have to be charged several times during the six hour 
cycle to be able to replace, uh, the currently, uh, operated diesel fuel machine. 
So we are looking for options for, uh, options that would help us keep our production cycle in tag so that we do not need to make it longer. 
So we can actually think the transportation of people with the use of electricity, 
we are testing that. Uh, the drilling machines is also a good option, but, uh, 
loaders, um, well, or, uh, trucks that are heavy duty, um- Our, uh, trucks that are heavy-duty, not yet probably. If the battery is developed substantially 
then, it could be feasible. 
And at Sierra Gorda, we actually have, um, uh, huge machines, uh, that are also, um, 
electrical, 
but, um, they, um, have to load vehicles that, um, have capacity of 250 tons. 
So theses are electrical machines, but they need to be, uh, supplied from the, uh, grid. 
It's not possible to upgrade these machines from the battery 
because the battery would be up very soon. 
But your question about Sierra Gorda electricity is very interesting. 
Chileans have it much easier because we spoke about the area that you have to dedicate to them, uh, photovoltaic, they have the entire Atacama, uh, 
Desert. 
And this is one of the sunniest places in the world and on top of it, it is completely empty. 
And the mine such as ours takes just a tiny fraction of this desert. 
Therefore, it's much easier to deploy photovoltaic farms there. 
And, um, for photovoltaics, you need to have appropriate acreage. 
And they have much more, um, ambitious plans. They want to use, uh, um, electrolysis to generate, uh, 
hydrogen, and they want to be, become a leading 
producer of, um, hydrogen in the world. 
And, and they will co- achieve that through the, um, by the sea 
with ships. Obviously, first they have to, 
um, uh, concentrate that into ammonia. 
And now over to my colleague. foreign language- 
I do confirm what Marcin has said. In two cases, we checked, 
uh, what are the companies have previously, uh, promised, and they were unable to deliver to us the machinery that would correspond to our profile. 
We are in talks with all major manufacturers worldwide, uh, so, uh, that's, that's the situation right now. 
As we got lower into the temperature, it is unfortunately just one, uh, degree. 
Uh, we will have, uh, temperature lower on the ground by one degree that will not solve our problem of cooling, uh, that formation. 
And we are thinking about that, we are open to, uh, this direction, uh, of developments, but apart from that, we need to optimize, uh, 
and cope with the difficult conditions. 
Thank you very much. I would like to come back for a second to the, uh, theme of operations and results on Sierra Gorda. 
I would like Paweł Gruza to answer the question from Tomasz Piwowarczyk. 
Thanks. To what activities, uh, did you, uh, achieve greater, uh, amount of, uh, copper, uh, in Sierra Gorda? 
Will you be able to maintain the 30% growth and production of a Chilean company? 
In principle, 
I mean, 
output as a function of metal content in the ore, but also, uh, that depends on optimization of the process itself and on parametrization of this process. 
Let me remind you that in the last quarters, 
we also concluded a certain investments, 
that were those tiny steps, 
low cost, uh, low, uh, capital intensity, baby steps that allowed us to improve the parameters of installation. 
We could enumerate here a number of elements, 
uh, for example, hydrocyclones, 
uh, and other, uh, technological elements. So all those activities are taken together, translated into greater capacity for processing 
and greater, uh, 
recovery 
on what geology offers to us. 
If you ask about the second half of the year, 
as I said, we do not expect any major collapse in the production, anything that would threaten our good results. 
But also at present, we are not getting any clear guidance, uh, quant- any quantified plan. 
Thank you very much. I think, uh, the, uh, president's commented previous, uh, um, answers, 
uh, exhaust the question that I'm going to read out right now. But 
there was a question addressed to Marcin Chludzinski from Jacob Kinovich. 
What to the greatest extent contributed to the improvement of the situation in Sierra Gorda? Which factors were of key importance in this process? 
Well, I tried to, uh, explain this at the beginning, uh, of, uh, my presentation, but maybe I'll address it in more detail. 
Ladies and gentlemen, when we, uh, joined this company, oh, we had 
our entries full, uh, of some big CAPEX projects which, 
uh, mean that by investing, uh, more billions, our production could grow. 
We took a risky decision. 
We invested in the form of purchase price plus loans for all the development of this project that were billions of, uh, złotys. 
Maybe it's high time now to use ordinary, uh, optimization of, uh, 
maintenance and, uh, management of, uh, industrial asset to subdue, uh, 
manage of industrial assets and try to squeeze as much of it as possible, 
so that in the following, uh, stages, we get even better financial results. 
So in a nutshell, uh, through a series of organizational initiatives, I can give you an example of vehicles. 
If, uh, one, uh, uh, vehicle is loaded to a greater extent, uh, thanks to better, 
uh, capacity, better motivation system, uh, incentive system for the driver, 
for, or the loader, 
we have, uh, several dozen percent 
higher volume of those, uh, 
trucks. And, uh, if we have a better, uh, transportation to the mills. 
Uh, and then, when we have a better coordination with maintenance, we act proactively. 
We eliminate all those, uh, risks that can potentially threaten us 
because, uh, they might, uh, bring down our, uh, production capacity down to 60% rather than 85% which is a standard in the industry. 
So we took a number of those baby steps, 
uh, and, uh, there's a reason we are able to produce more, that is the work of, uh, us as a whole management board inaudible, managers, uh, here in Poland. 
We are working on this, uh, all the time. People know that this is Polish money of a Polish company, 
but we need to make sure that the investment is, uh, conducted in a way, uh, that pays off. 
And also, the cost, uh, level, we undertook another initiatives. Wherever possible, we, uh, try to do things, 
uh, um, in a less, uh, expensive way. 
Like in this photovoltaic project, uh, 
are yes, mm, or, um, non, uh, closing down of the company during COVID. 
It was not easy at all, 
uh, to continue production. Uh, COVID is still, uh, uh, at high risk of, uh, COVID. 
We have, uh, frequent inspections. We, uh, go through them with a positive outcome 
and that means that we are able to manage, uh, the, uh, companies that are quite well. 
Also, relations with trade unions, 
you know, this is a delicate matter in Chile, and we are, uh, nevertheless able to, uh, find common language, uh, with workers there. 
With the scale of production that is millions, um, of, um, złotys or dollars, 
we were able to ensure transportation for employees, continuity of operations. 
Uh, so, uh, that was a whole range of such factors. I would call them, uh, importance, uh, significance, good management 
and without an extra CAPEX, uh, we can see the results. 
CAPEX can be brought to any of these, uh, uh, trend, uh, becomes, uh, a lasting one 
than we can consider adding additional capital expenditures. 
Thank you very much. Uh, let me just briefly read out question to 
Andrzej Kensbok. 
inaudible and UBS ask this question. 
And it concerns doubts about, uh, the significant increase and remuneration at KGHM. 
Uh, the second, uh, quarter should not, uh, be treated this… uh, second quarter level be treated as a starting point for, uh, the following ones. 
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, remuneration cost, uh, is derivative of, uh, the collective bargaining agreement that we signed. 
This collective bargaining agreement, uh, identifies quite precisely the algorithm, uh, that, uh, determines salaries. 
And it is a derivative of, of this, uh, arrangement. 
In the collective bargaining agreement, we also included, um, award from, uh, the profit. 
If all the factors that we have mentioned today, uh, continue on the positive trend, we forecast a record high profit, 
and then we, uh, are obliged to establish a provision for an increased bonus, uh, for all the crew. 
So we pay out more, 
but on the other hand, we also have the feeling that this collective bargaining agreement and our activities 
allow us to share, uh, uh, the beneficial situation of the company, uh, 
with, um, broad range of stakeholders that is employees. 
Thank you very much. I have a financial question as well. I will quickly answer it right now. Reminding you, uh, of the impact of hedging on our result. 
Rafoviat asked, uh, about, uh, how much hedging, uh, came on sales and how was on the remaining activities 
in the first half of the year? 
On hedging, we had 
742 million, 
uh, adjustment on revenue. 733, uh, million reduction of, uh, the, uh, result on other operations, 
and the remaining 20 million, uh, was, uh, assigned to financial result. 
And you can find it in our presentation in its full version, but I just mentioned this as something that, uh, facilitates our modeling. 
Are there any questions from the room? 
It seems we have more questions coming in. Uh, some of them have already been answered, 
so I'm quickly going through, uh, what comes in here online. 
I would just like to refer to the question that was asked before about electrical energy. The 
CEO answered that you expected among other things, uh, reduction, uh, 
I think it was a reduction. 
Reduction in, uh, the, the power capacity fee. Why do you expect this fee, 
uh, to be reduced? 
Does it follow from any regulations? Yes, it does follow from, uh, regulations. 
We, 
uh, in the regulatory policy of the European Commission, we are in the list of, 
uh, uh, uh, industries that can be exempted from the fee. Mining, uh, copper mining, uh, can be exempted from the fee. 
Now, uh, uh, resolution is, mm, being considered, uh, where this exemption is envisaged. 
And what was this fee, uh, in the first, uh, half 2021? 
About 100 million PLN. And this fee will continue till the end of, uh, 2021? 
That depends on when, uh, the resolution, the CEO had just mentioned, will come into forms. 
Thank you very much. 
I have, uh, two quick questions regarding whether we can say something more, whether can, uh, dwell on the subject of our interest in MSCR, uh, reactors and hydrogen. 
Um, but we have already mentioned here that those, uh, things are being studied 
as part of, uh, a broader discussion, broader thinking. 
Oh wait, the results of which, uh, we will try to show you, 
uh, when we talk about update of our strategy, or certain element of the strategy. 
Um, on my part, we have exhausted the, the questions that was sent in by email, so thank you very much. 
Uh, let me just remind you that all questions and answers from today 
and the questions that, uh, you will still send to us by email will be published on our website. We will, uh, 
provide answers, and we will add any details if you, uh, have any more specific questions. We are at your disposal also right after this conference. 
Let's hope we will meet again, uh, next quarter, hopefully with a bigger number of participants. Thank you very much. 
I would like to thank the management board as well. Thank you.
