Good evening, hello. Welcome to the teleconference dedicated to Teleprime group results for the first quarter of 2021. 
My name is Adam Kichinsky and I'll run this call together with inaudible and inaudible. 
The webcast of the presentation along with the 
audio feed is also streamed on our corporate website at Teleprime.com and our YouTube channel. 
Let's get started. Please jump to slide 3. 
Improving Cyberpunk 2077 remains our top priority. Since the beginning of this year, we've released five updates 
and of course there is more to come. 
The next update is to be released in a few weeks. 
As we announced before, this year, you can also expect three inaudible providing small bonus content for gamers as well as 
an updated next-gen edition of the game, which is scheduled for the second half of the year. 
On slide number 4, you can see how our efforts improved cyber functionability. 
The crash rate is getting lower and lower with each update. 
Please bear in mind that it is somewhat natural for each update to cause some extra short-term boost in statistics which is strictly related to the process of downloading the update itself, 
that's why the chart shows local peaks around the time of releases, but overall we can definitely observe a downward trend here. 
Given the recent improvement and information we have, we strongly believe that the game will prove success in the long run. 
Moving on to the next two slides. 
On slide six, you can see our plans related to inaudible the Witcher Universe for this year. 
inaudible the youngest member of the inaudible family is about to launch inaudible monster's lair. 
A free to play mobile location-based inaudible that uses AR technology. This release is expected this summer. 
As for the second of the year, we plan to release the next gen of the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 
That's all from my side. Let's now move on to slide seven. inaudible the floor is yours. 
Thank you, Adam. Let's start with our P&L statement. 
This year's first quarter results are presented together with our 2020 Q1 which by then was the best first quarter we ever had. 
Last year, due to the pandemic the release of the Witcher series and that of the Witcher 3 in terms of the Switch Q1 2021 revenue inaudible was nearly 2.5 times better than the first quarter of 2019. 
This year, the growth drivers inaudible. 
In the first quarter of 2021, Cyberpunk was our leading IP that generated nearly 60% of sales of products to the prior inaudible. 
It's worth mentioning that due to the nonexistence of Cyberpunk on the Sony Digital store, which is potentially the second biggest marketplace for us. 
And settlements of inaudible provisions we said in Q4. Our Cyberpunk revenues inaudible have mainly been driven by PC inaudible channels. 
The second source of revenue comes from goods and materials fueled by inaudible segment where the segment itself enjoyed at 12% increase quarter to quarter. 
As always, our sales were accompanied by cost of sales. 
The main entry here is visible in the cost of products and services sold line where we included 70 million depreciation of Cyberpunk 2077. 
Our gross profit from sales reached 135 million inaudible, 10 millions inaudible less than a year ago despite the 70 million inaudible Cyberpunk depreciation. 
Our operating cost increased, driven by four main factors. 
First, a big part of the debt team was working on updating Cyberpunk and since this was a service to an already released game, 
costs were booked directly into P&L, into the selling cost line. 
Total servicing cost dedicated to Cyberpunk added to the much smaller inaudible live operation service costs and altogether amounted to 30 million inaudible in the first quarter of this year. 
Second, during first quarter we run research and prototyping work for our subsequent projects. 
Such expenses need to be grouped directly into P&L into the general and administrative costs. 
These expenses amounted to over 9 million inaudible and represent approximately half of the increase of the G&E position. 
Thirdly, the general and administrative costs include 9.4 million inaudible of known monetary cost related to our employee stock option plan. 
This is far from the half million more than the respective cost of the previous program booked in first quarter of 2020. 
And last but not least, the increase in all our operating costs also reflects the gross of the back office marketing communication and sales teams over the last year. 
Year on year, the head count for this part of the team, uh, grew approximately by one sixth. 
All in all, deducting financial expenses and income taxes, our net profit for the period amounted to 32.5 million inaudible which is proportionally less than usual. 
Mainly due to the time when inaudible research and servicing work booked directly into our costs of this quarter. 
Let's now move to the next stage, our consolidated balance sheet. 
Our fixed assets grew by 144 million inaudible, reaching over 900 million. 
This growth comes mostly from the increase in financial assets as a result of foreign inaudible acquisition which was made to diversify and allocate some of our financial reserves. 
The 64 million inaudible growth of other inaudible comes 
mostly from the re-calculation of our deferred income taxes by nearly 60 million inaudible. 
But the most notable changes occurred among the working assets. 
The inaudible increased by 1 billion, decreased by 1 billion and 91 millions inaudible, leading to an increase in cash and bank deposits by 823 millions 
inaudible and 140 millions inaudible increase in domestic included in the other financial assets line. 
All in all, over the first three months of 2021, the total value of our cash from deposits in three months increased by 1 billion and 40 millions inaudible reaching a total of 1 billion and 950 million inaudible. 
Moving to the equity and liability side. 
The first provisions we set, uh, long-term at the end of 2020 were classified to short-term provisions. 
Hence, the change from 145 millions inaudible to zero for this position as of the end of March 2021. 
At the same time, the total value of provisions among the short-term liabilities increased by 14 millions inaudible. 
Together with the decrease of long- term provisions, this made the total balance of provisions to decrease by 105 millions inaudible. 
Over the first quarter of 2021 we also reported an increase in our liabilities. 
This is mainly caused by the growth of our current income tax liabilities by 66 millions inaudible. 
This growth was offset in big part by the deferred income tax asset inaudible I mentioned a minute ago. 
Let's move to the next page. Each time I comment on the results, I typically present the charts with our expenditures on development projects. 
This time I decided to slightly modify it to visualize the allocation of our inaudible in recent quarters and explain how respective costs were booked and influenced our P&L and balance sheet. 
The blue part represents our expenditures and development projects. It's a good perspective. This is the quarterly increase in the capitalized volume. 
Why was it so high in 2020 Q4? 
Mainly due to the final phase of development of Cyberpunk related costs, including provisions for inaudible. 
This year, the capitalized amount was smaller as many of the developers were moved to other tasks. 
The yellow part represents costs of servicing already released games. Until the release of Cyberpunk on the 10th of December, these costs were mainly related to inaudible. 
After the release of Cyberpunk, a big part of the team was moved to updating the game, which translated into the increase for Q4 and especially Q1 2021. 
And the green part represents the so-called research costs. Initial costs for prototyping of new projects. 
As you can see we have initiated these costs last year but the increase clearly occurred this year. 
Both the yellow and the green parts which are servicing and researching expenses were booked directly into our profit and loss calculation. 
Please note that the inaudible company which works full force inaudible is not included in the presented consolidated results yet. 
Let's move to the next page. Simplified cash flow presentation. 
Putting aside the bookkeeping qualification of incomes, costs and expenses, this quarter we reported record high positive controls for the inaudible. 
Remaining revenues from the premier of Cyberpunk were paid into the company with resulted in the decrease of receivables. 
Only now our cash from deposits and inaudible value increased by 1 billion inaudible and reached an unprecedented total of 1 million 950 million inaudible. 
And this inaudible just to the next page. 
Based on the strong financial position, and taking into consideration the 455 millions inaudible excess of inaudible liabilities over receivables, as of the end of Q1, 
the board inaudible proposed to the general inaudible to pay out a dividend in the total amount of nearly 504 millions inaudible 
which translates into 5 latic per share. 
The dividend day is set for tomorrow and the dividend is to be paid out on the 8th of June. 
Thank you. That's all from my side. Now, we can move to the Q&A section. 
Thank you. So, if you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone or keypad. 
And we start with our first question from Nick Dempsey, Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Yeah, good evening, guys. Can you hear me okay? Yes, we can. 
Hello. Um, so two questions please. First of all, uh, would love to get, uh, an understanding of the Cyberpunk unit sales in the quarter. 
Um, and secondly, wondering if you could update us on your conversations with Sony about what it would take to get you back on the PlayStation store. 
inaudible, you've shown us some metrics have been improving there but does, 
do- do- does Sony have a particular set of metrics in their mind, uh, which would then allow you to go back on the store or how have those conversations progressed? Thank you. 
Okay. So, I'll start with the first question. 
Um, we usually communicate on, uh, unit sales for when we reach certain milestones, round numbers, uh, that we can announce. 
Eh, and this quarter as usual, 
we presented revenues divided into… usual, uh, we presented revenues, uh, divided into each segment and inaudible we also guided 
how much of the revenue was uh, was dedicated to Cyberpunk. So close to 60% of products say it's revenues came from Cyberpunk, 
and as I mentioned most of the sales came from PC digital distribution channels.inaudible crosstalk yep, go ahead. Uh, uh 
I was just going to follow up there, so. Uh, maybe if I could just follow up on- on that 
answer. In, 
if we take, 
uh, sort or the- the- the average sort of digital, uh, revenue per unit to be somewhere in the 135-140 kind of sloppy sort of range, 
when I look at what I used for Ubisoft et 
cetera, that would get me to 800,000 -ish kind of er, sort of range of Cyberpunk in itself. 
Am I at all in the right ball-park? 
I'm afraid this kind of calculation is not to be applied on uh inaudible and especially for a very special quarter, like the first quarter after the release. 
Please note that uh, the revenues we present are the revenues we achieve from our distributors. 
Uh, and in case of Ubisoft the situation is different. Ubisoft directly distributes many of their games and have direct access to retail channels which we do not. 
So our sales are, 
uh, based on wholesale co-operation with partners, that then supply the, uh, retails source, and therefore the characteristics and the pricing is different. 
And- and- and- and sorry to come back again but you did say it was mostly PC and digital, 
so, I was thinking that that, uh, wholesale partner relationship would be less relevant 
to the average unit, uh, average revenue per unit in this particular course. 
Um, to- to give you some more light on that. 
When a retail store sells a copy it probably purchased this copy back last year, so this number of copies was reported to us by distributors last year. 
And we, uh, reported the revenue for this last year. 
At the same time last year, we set certain provisions for potential returns and uh, refunds we- we will be having 
with our distributors. 
But all this time during Q1 the retail stores keep selling the game, so there are two totally different layers. 
Our co-operation with distributors and the retails stores which keep selling the game. 
Uh, therefore, direct comparison of the two cannot be made and especially in such a first quarter, first after the release, 
where, distributors still have the stock purchased on release. 
Where- or, retail stores still have the stock purchased on release. 
Okay, that's- that's helpful. Sorry I interrupted 
you. And we take our next question from Mathew Walker credit- crosstalk No I- I believe crosstalk there was a- sorry I believe there was a second question which we didn't get to because- because there was like a- a- a- you know, ongoing questioning about the units. 
Uh, the second one was about the Sony and the, uh, PlayStation in particular instead of Netflix, how the conversation progresses, so, I- I- 
I cannot go deep into the set of metrics so the how the conversation progresses, it has to remain at the 
discretion of- of- of PlayStation and of course ourselves, 
uh, um, but yes there is, there is some sort of metrics, lets, lets put it like that, at a high level but again we're not goi- we- we cannot go into the details of- of where we are with that. 
But there is a process we're in the middle of that process and uh, and uh, you know, this- this conversation's happy. 
That's that's as much as we can say, the decision will be announced when it's- when it's ready to be announced. 
Okay, thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question is from Mathew Walker, Credit Sense, please go ahead, your line is open. 
Thanks a lot, um, good evening, just a few questions please. The first is, could you give us the actually digital percentage of sales in the quarter? 
Uh, secondly, could you tell us what discounting happened in the quarter and what you're doing for discounting, if anything, 
uh, in, uh, Q2? 
And then, longer term, um, could you say, has, you know, you're doing the- the- um, simultaneous game development, um, 
could you tell us, you know, when is work likely or has work started already on two new games? Or could you tell us when work is likely to start, uh, on those games? Thanks. So 
I will take the first one. I assume you mean that digital percent of Cyberpunk sales? Or overall our sales? Um. crosstalk Um, overall. 
Overall. 
Yeah overall. Um, so it was very much digital, I do not have the February, 
uh, in front of myself that I could reliably give you. 
But uh, as I mentioned the retail stores in general still have the stock they purchased, uh, on release and they keep selling it. 
This means that uh, our distributors, uh, do not seek additional quantities to them so our revenues, 
uh, do not include any- any additional sales on that. 
Uh, what influences our- our revenues are the digital sales as uh, then, the- the sales are each time the reporting is instant without the sub-distributor in the middle of the process, 
uh, and most of the sales occurred uh, for PC on all of the available PC platforms, there's obviously the Xbox digital, uh, 
sales and since Cyberpunk inaudible is non-existent on the Sony store front we- we didn't report any revenues NSAs from- from this one. 
However obviously Witcher 3 was still selling but uh, for the overall picture, uh definitely digital, uh, digital was 
uh was- was doing most of the revenues for us. 
Hi, uh, inaudible I can take the second one. 
Um, so when it comes to discounting there's- there's basically two kinds of discount. Uh, Uh, one is, uh, what we call permanent mark-down, 
which is like a permanent slash of price, and the other one is promotional. 
So, within Q1 I am not aware of a permanent mark-down, there's been a bunch of uh, promotion- promotional, uh, uh mark-downs happening both in physical and in digital. 
You have to remember that we, we are not in direct control of- of- of the discounts, uh, that are happening in the retail 
because those, uh, uh, uh, that remains in the retailers' discretion. There is- there is of course, uh, special support funds, sort of like a marketing support fund for- for retail, you know, to do those, 
which is- which is normal for any game to be honest, 
uh, you know, quarter post launch, this is nothing unusual here. So that's been- that's been happening for uh, for CP, 
I've seen, I've seen discounts between, uh, 20, 30 and 40%, 
depending on the- on the occasion, or the country or the territory, you know. There's- there's as many stories as there are retailers around the world. 
In terms of digital, um, I've seen- I've seen discounts of, uh, 10 and 20% on the PC- PC store 
front. Uh, when it comes to planned discounting policy for Q2, we- we of course have, uh, certain assumptions, 
uh, and- and- and- and plans of what- what's gonna be happening there, but uh, we- we are definitely not in a position to reveal that inaudible actually seeing anybody, 
uh, uh, you know reveal 
ahead, uh, that kind of, uh, uh, uh plans. 
So. That's it. 
And I'll take the- the third one 
inaudible so as we announced doing the- the strategy update, uh, we are planning to start, 
uh, AAA, parallel AAA development from 2022. 
But of course, and this year is a year of- of transformation. 
There is much more work, uh, on Cyberpunk. Uh, of course a big part of the team still working on Cyberpunk. 
But, definitely there are teams, uh, preparing, uh, future unannounced projects. 
I would say that one third of the- of the Cyberpunk team or- or AAA content team, uh, is working on, uh, on unannounced things. But, it's not like we are in uh, parallel AAA development. 
It's, it's- 
other preparations for- for future works, not- not development per se. Okay, thanks a lot. Thank you. 
Our next question is from phonetic Keenram Jeffries. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
<unk> Uh, good morning everybody. Uh, good- good evening, sorry. 
Um, so, three questions if I may. 
Um, perhaps if you could just enlarge a little bit on that point about staff, your original plan had been that the Cyberpunk team would kind of divide into three, um, third moving onto a new project, 
um, a third working on DLCs and maybe a third on- on, uh, the 
mobile game, I think anyway, tell me perhaps how things divide up at the moment? 
Secondly, 
um, regarding Xbox, it's on sale but, you know, when you click through there is a warning saying there may be issues pending patches and so on, is there a similar 
kind of discussion going on with Xbox? 
Um, and finally, in terms of, um, next-gen versions of the game, 
um, and, hopefully therefore a relaunch of the whole game, is there a sort of any indication when in H2 you might plan to do that? 
I would imagine at least after July and August as those are holiday periods but, uh, please guide me if that's wrong. Thank you. 
I can, I will start with the first one, uh, Adam, uh, on- on this end. 
So, 
um, nearly half of- of uh, Cyberpunk is still, uh, continue working on Cyberpunk itself, and uh, Cyberpunk next-gen, uh, edition. 
Uh, then we have have teams working on unannounced- still, not- preparing works on, uh, to unannounced AAA lines I would say. 
I'm not very precise because we don't want to pre-announce anything which is not announced yet so I'm not referring directly to the question, 
but, but, there are teams uh, smaller teams, uh, in transformation, uh, preparing, uh, works on- on future content. 
But I can just, um, I can just repeat what- wha- wha- what I already said 
that, next year is- is the year when we want to- to- to- to speed things and- and- Whether you want to speed things and to work full scale. 
Of course, depending on the project and the different phases, I prefer to play content. Okay, understand. 
Regarding the second question, it's inaudible the 
question was about the Xbox and the warning language on the product page. 
On the storefront, yes, there's a similar conversation happening with the Xbox team as well 
as the PlayStation one. Okay. All right. 
And the third, Adam again, 
sorry we can't comment on it, I mean definitely after our promise to start and the communication closer through each, we don't want… to say anything more about 
mid term more than second half of the year. Deliberately of course, we have the date 
internally, but it's too early to say anything about it. Okay, 
I thought I'd ask. Thank you very much. 
Our next question is from Vladimir Espalof, inaudible your line is open, please go ahead. 
Hello, thank you for taking my question. My first question will be on the transferring in the second quarter. The first quarter was very successful 
so the major pledge was released only by the end of the quarter, do you see an improvement in the sales trend, at least on PCs for Cyberpunk in the second quarter? 
And on the inaudible with major fixing taking place in the first quarter, 
do you see any improvement in terms of flexibility or lower costs 
which incur in the second quarter? What should we expect from this perspective? 
I also have a question on the inaudible apart from dividends, how are you going to spend the cash pile that you have 
after you received a lot of cash in the first quarter? 
And maybe some date on the MMA pipeline. Thank you. 
I'll take the first and the second question. 
Um, we're not hiding future results so I cannot lead too much into pre sizing formation, 
but definitely each year, the most important part of the second quarter 
is the June and all the summer promos, and this is still in front of us. 
Uh, but looking broader, the situation, um, as I mentioned on the annual conference regarding the first quarter results, 
the general situation as long as we are not back on the Sony store has not changed. 
We… one of the leading marketplaces for us is not available 
and we generate most of the sales on the PC digital channels. 
Uh, until the moment it changes, we uh, will have more difficult situation than we would like to have. 
So that's the general comment on what may happen or what is happening over the second quarter. 
As far as the profitability is concerned, 
the size of the team involved in updating Cyberpunk is slowly decreasing, 
and also the research costs I mentioned in my part of the presentation should also be smaller in the second quarter. 
This is a natural process and that's what we expect. 
But the total profitability of the company will depend on the proportion of sales 
plus the depreciation of Cyberpunk and all of our operating expenses. 
And that's something we will definitely discuss on our H1 results. 
As far as the capital allocation, the significant part of the capital we earned over last year, 
will be paid via dividends, then as I mentioned we still have some of the liabilities 
in our balance sheet that there is a significant excess of liabilities over 
receivables and this is also to be included 
in our cash flow funds. Actually, part of that was already paid as part of the team bonuses 
which we covered in May in the 2nd quarter. 
And the rest is supposed to be capped to the company to finance our gross future projects, our marketing plans, 
and potentially some of the MNA 
transactions. Thank you. 
Which is actually the fourth 
question on the stand. In terms of MNA, if there will be anything to announce, we will announce it, I mean, that's the 
situation. 
Now we are 
finalizing the deal with our Vancouver studio and with inaudible 
And if any further plans like this or of this kind will appear, we'll inform the market. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Our next question is from Matthew Leteunan from Bernstein, your line is open, please go ahead. 
Hello, good afternoon. The first question, thank you for giving us the breakdown on the product research, development and service costs. 
Um, just based on this and your earlier comments, just to clarify, 
so there hasn't been any material development costs capitalized 
for any new project on anything resembling Cyberpunk's 
scale before Q1 this year? 
And the second question is on Spoko? So do you have any color to give on sort of the soft launch processes look like? 

What other countries have you done? There's been Russia, Australia for monetization. Any color to give in terms of what the feedback so far has been? 
So I'll take the first one. Yes, 
the direct development expenditures during Q1 were smaller, as part of the team worked on updates in Cyberpunk. 
And another part of the team was also involved in the research, so early works for subsequent projects that we have in the pipeline. 
One we finish the research phase, which should come shortly, this will be qualified as development expenditures and will be capitalized. 
I'll take the second one Adam. 
So what we are doing, we are soft launching, tweaking not only the game itself but some 
attention, monetization along 
with, with testing the game. 
And we are closer and closer to the final result, 
and we are happy with what we can see. But of course, before the game is launched in the full scale, we don't want to you know, 
announce 
any internal data regarding how soft launches were progressing. 
The extensive size of soft launches 
enables us to tweak many many things, and we learned a lot and this project is definitely 
driven by design of course… 
the first priority, by statistics and data as well. 
Thank you, very helpful. Thank you. Our next question is from Kent Rams Geoffries. 
Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Hello, I'm back again. Firstly, on the R&D that's being expensed on early stage work, 
is that a new thing? Or I simply don't remember this from kind of, back in the day when I guess you were working on Cyberpunk before Witcher 3 came out? 
So this is kind of a new approach or just something perhaps that wasn't significant or I don't remember from the past? 
Secondly, can I ask just about how expansion work is expensed or capitalized? 
So expansions to Cyberpunk, which you said obviously that you plan expansions in the future. 
Um, and finally, um, on the discussions with Sony and with Xbox, 
firstly, 
does it potentially involve the next gen version, or is it simply a discussion about the last gen? 
We call it current gen, but you know, the PS4 version. 
Or does it somehow involve also satisfying them about next gen? 
And that probably you can answer, the one I'm not inaudible, 
is it simply a technical discussion or does it involve financial and pricing issues for the game? Thank you. 
I will take the first questions. As far as I remember, 
we had the same approach. However, back in the day it was not significant. 
And regarding the expansions, I may say that currently they are, the expenditures on them are capitalized. Okay, thank you. 
Sorry, this is foreign language The question about Sony and Xbox again, 
um, the question was whether it involves the next gens or only current gens or is it just technical, or do they involve financial and pricing discussion? 
It's still… 
it's a very good and very difficult question but all that have to remain of course at discretion between the parties. 
If 20 years from now I'm going to be writing memoirs, I promise to answer that, but for now it really has to remain between PlayStation and us 
and we'll have announcements to share when they are ready. And of course, Xbox the same situation. Okay. 
Well, I understand that. Thank you. Thank you. Our last question is from Ali Naqui from HSBC. 
Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Hi, good evening. I just have a- Your line is open. Hi, uh, good evening. I just had a couple questions for 
you. Um, your expectations for Cyberpunk once it gets back to the PlayStation store, 
do they diminish from your previous expectations or do you think that you'll have to invest in marketing to get back to where you had initially on launch? 
Um, second question, and a bit of a, a reminder, 
how do you, um, paired on the Cyberpunk development or do you contribute it I guess once, uh, uh, you know, when you, when you, um, launch back on the PS store, or if that gets delayed? 
And, and finally, in terms of timing of the downloadable content that Cyberpunk, 
what's your strategy in terms of, you know, how much content there is and into the pricing? Is it all gonna be free or all paid for? Thank you. 
Hi, this is inaudible. 
Could you, could you actually repeat the, 
uh… I-I didn't fully understand, to be honest, the, uh, Sony part. The, the, the marketing and, and… Sorry. Could you repeat that? crosstalk Okay so. Sir. mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
So when the, when Cyberpunk launches back on the PlayStation store, 
um, what are your expectations… Right. For sales? mm-hmm <affirmative>. Do they return back to what you had previously or would you have to invest in marketing to get back to that level? 
Oh, okay, I mean, so I don't even think we're, we're looking at this way. I mean, uh, 
uh, of course, I mean, uh, it's gonna need improvement of sales when we're back on the PlayStation because the sales are currently none, 
uh, uh, because we're not in the store. So when we get back there, I mean, I'm assuming there will be some, some sales, of course. 
Uh, so that will be a positive, uh, information on its own. 
Uh, uh, however, in terms of bringing it back to the previous level, that is a pretty, uh, tough question, because, because the game left the store on the 18th 
of December and we're right now uh, or pretty much in June. Uh, its May 31st right now. 
So, so, honestly speaking, I mean it, it unheard of to, to go back to the level of sales from, from the launch. Uh, you know six, six months post. 
I mean, I think that's, as much as, as I go in, in the details here 
but, it would be unrealistic to assume that we're going to go back to uh, uh, to the December level of sales with, with any kind of uh, uh, 
marketing. Uh, we the, when it comes to marketing support of coming back to the PlayStation, I would not really expect. When, when when that happens, if that happens and its announced. 
We would probably run some sort of, you know information campaigns that again, is available but that's pretty much it. Nothing, nothing bombastic so to say. 
All right sorry, and the next question. There was a next question, tidying of the available content to CP uh, I, 
I'm assuming this is above the uh, the expansions, so the, so the bigger ones 
uh. Expansions uh, what we were talking expansions, the, what we meant was something similar to uh, inaudible uh, or hearts of stone. So, the bigger expansions for, 
for the inaudible leave expansions for inaudible would be, would be uh, 
definitely paid, paid, would not be for free. 
Hope that helps. Yep, thank you. 
Thank you. 
It appears there are no further questions at this time. 
Thank you, so now we have a section to also the questions asked uh, on chat. 
So, I'll read them and then we'll, we'll answer. 
The first two are from inaudible. 
The first, how big is the percentage of employees or programmers to working on the improvement ofinaudible? 
And the second, and what are you seeing with recently on employees chair? 
So, as I said, on inaudible, they're still around 300 people and in terms of inaudible, 
the year after we, is a natural year uh, of, of, of higher chance. 
So, so uh, we, we don't see anything uh, unexpected or surprising. 
Uh, that, that's the only thing I, I can say. 
All right the next question from inaudible, do you 
observe significantly increase and turn over after inaudible after the annual bonuses? 
I would just answer this, this uh, question. The next from inaudible, how many parch purchase do you plan to release in the next two to three months? 
Uh, that's tricky because actually, our purchase, some are parches, some are smaller. 
We got, we, we used to uh, call smaller one hot 
fixes, it wasn't very fortunate because the nature of hot fixes is different. The natural nature. 
Uh so, so, from now on, any update will be called parch as, and if there will be any hot 
fixes. So, so fixes after the parch is deployed, then we will call them hot fixes. 
And in terms of, of number, uh, I don't want to pre, uh, announce things which are not announced yet. 
We were prepared just to say that the next parch, not the biggest one, I mean. Rather, rather smaller 
will, will uh, be launched in the next of, of weeks. It's, it's almost ready. 
But of course, we are working on the, on the future purchase as well. And to add some color on it, 
the first few is of purchases were mostly focused on um, low level technical areas, not only of course. 
We were fixing uh, glitches and bugs as well but we're focused on, on stability uh, performance and so on. 
And uh, because those things were, were, to our opinion, the most important. 
Um, and then we'll be more and more into uh, improving things, 
uh without promising anything but the the the course of action will uh, will change a bit so we'll be more, more focused on pushing 
uh, the the the uh, persist quality uh, further. 
The next question from inaudible, what 
is the percentage of sales of CP2772GOG.com? Sorry, uh, 
we can't share with you actually. We, we never shared this kind of internal information so, so we, we can't add any color in it. 
The next from inaudible. 
Hello, could you comment on number of workers of C-drive and your targets for employment for the end of 2021 and 2022? 
Hmm, we have targets but uh, they are not revealed. 
So, we are of course, we are uh, in terms of hire 
processes but we don't share any numbers with our target. I can, I can just highlight this, 
one of the areas we want definitely to grow is, is from inaudible. 
As we have access to the uh, wide uh, pool of clients there. 
Uh, but of course we'll keep hiring in Poland. We need people in Poland uh, from around the globe uh, as well. 
And that was all on our chat. 
Thank you very much and see you on half, first half results in roughly three months. Bye-bye.
