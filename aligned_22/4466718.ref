Good morning and welcome to our conference call for the third quarter 2021. 
I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. 
The Colombian economy continues recovering at a pace better than expected. 
According to our latest estimates, GDP could grow close to 10% in 2021, 
and for 2022, 
we expect a soft landing to a moderate expansion of around 3.6%. 
The main drivers behind this forecast are the resilient performance of internal demand, 
particularly product consumption, which will remain dynamic as more households, 
especially those in the highest incomes return to pre- COVID spending levels. 
We also expect private investment to recover, 
exports to accelerate, and the sectors that were severely hit by the pandemic to go back to 2019 levels. 
All this is partly compensated by the moderating global growth and a gradual move forward of the fiscal and monetized streams. 
The main reasons to our view are the uncertainties surrounding the electoral cycle and eventual new waves of COVID-19 cases. 
The positive trend of the economy is reflected in the balance sheet 
results, which we consider positive for the third quarter. 
Given that the trend of the better-than-expected economic recovery 
not only applies for Colombia but in all the geographies where we have presence. 
Before getting to the details, I want to highlight some key topics. 
The loan book grew 3.3% compared with the previous quarter. 
Net fees grew 9% in the quarter. 
Collection fees Tier One under full Basel III was 11.8% 
and net income for the quarter was 943 billion 
pesos. Net provision charges for the quarter was 514 billion pesos, 
down 18% when you compare with the second quarter of 2021, 
mainly driven by better economic forecast and the end of inaudible program in Colombia 
and Panama. For our digital platforms, Nequi and Bancolombia a la Mano continue to grow at a steady pace, 
adding both 14 million clients and 1.4 trillion pesos in deposits. 
Digital transactions represents 85% of the total transactions, and the digital channels 44% of total sales. 
We continue to grow in our ecosystem strategy after the first year of successful operations. 
It is already positioned as one of the most relevant in the country, with more than 8 million visits. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the presentation to Juan Pablo Espinosa, who will further elaborate on the performance of the Colombian economy. Juan Pablo? 
Thank you, Juan Carlos. Now, I will ask you to go to slide number three in the presentation. 
Let me start by saying that traditional analysis has failed to predict and measure accurately the effects that the pandemic has had on the economy. 
Instead, the development of new ways of understanding the economic reality has gained momentum. 
Most of these advances are based on the use of data. 
At Bancolombia, we have been pioneers of this emerging trend in the local financial industry. 
Our proprietary and analytical tools and our large sample of banking transactions allows us to have a comprehensive, real-time picture of the state of the Columbian economy. 
In the first place, our inaudible tracker of overall activity which follows closely inaudible official figures, 
points to our year-on-year growth in the third quarter of 14.1%, 
higher than the latest consensus estimate of 9.2%. 
A significant contributor to this growth is domestic demand, 
which according to Bancolombia's card holder purchases has been accelerating in the past few months. 
For instance, in the first 20 days of October these transactions grew 20% compared to 2020 and 8% relative to 2019. 
Moreover, the graph at the bottom left shows that the volume of deposits 
to corporate banking accounts by sector and firm size, relative to pre-pandemic levels. 
These figures are good at anticipating sectoral performance, and they are signaling that important contributors to GDP, 
such as retail, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors, expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter. 
Furthermore, SME's revenues are recovering faster than those of large firms. 
Finally, the number of payrolls payments processed through- through Bancolombia's accounts, which 
is a proxy for formal labor demand, accelerated during the last quarter. 
This suggests that the labor market is already reacting to the rebounding economic activity. 
In turn, this would allow an employment rate to decline further towards the end of the year. 
All in all, our indicators point to a widespread and consistent improvement of the Columbian economy after the disruptions caused by the national strike and the reduction of COVID cases. 
This bodes well for two year 2021 growth expectations, which currently stand at 10%. 
Now, let me turn the presentation back to Juan Carlos. 
Thank you, Juan Pablo. 
Moving to slide four, I want to continue this presentation by explaining the loans and deposits performance. 
The recovery of the economy has resulted in significant progress in our business. 
We have experienced an important growth in the number of clients. 
Include our offer of products and services inaudible our digital strategy. 
All this is clearly reflected in the performance of loans and deposits. 
The loan book continued showing a steady growth across the three main sectors. 
In that dynamic, uh, partially supported by the economic recovery 
but continues to be evident in inaudible 
This trend confirms that the bank overcame the economic shock of the pandemic without relevant implications on its financial stability. 
Since the beginning of the year, the retail and mortgage segments have shown positive trends. Whereas the commercial segment started to improve since the second quarter. 
Because of the expansionary monetary policy with historically low interest rate makes the balance of bank deposits decrease over the last 12 months 
and this has been compensated with an increase in savings and checking accounts, 
which has allowed us to reduce the funding cost. 
However, as the Central Bank started last month a rate hiking cycle and the loan book is growing at a better pace, 
we expect the balance in term deposits to raise again in the same direction of the funding costs. 
Moving to slide five, I'm going to elaborate on the evolution of digital sales and distribution channel. 
During the first nine months of the year, digital sales have represented 44% of all sold products. 
Digital sales have maintained a steady evolution, despite the reactivation of traditional channels and of the reopening of the economy. 
This indicates that the customer experience evolution has accelerated during 2021 towards a permanent adoption of digital channels by many of our clients. 
I would like to point out one of the- our strengths, the share of processed transactions. 
On the lower right-side chart of the slide, 
you can notice that Bancolombia preserved 47% of all monetary transactions completed via web and 62% of those processed via mobile phones out of all financial institutions in Columbia. 
Moving to slide six, I am going to elaborate about Nequi. 
As you know, Nequi is our neobank, targeting primarily young people and focusing on the way they relate with banks. 
During this quarter we added 1.5 million new clients, reaching 8.6 million with a very low acquisition cost. 
Deposits are nearly 1 trillion pesos. Our net promoter score continued increasing with high levels of engagement. 
Remember, that we consider an active client the one interacting at least once a month towards a monetary transaction. 
And this is how we leverage the development of our profitability model, 
having clients with a low acquisition cost and with a high active user ratio. 
Nequi cards are growing fast. We have more than doubled the number reported 12 months ago. 
Notice that we are not only issuing more plastics, 
the number of transactions and the volume of payments are increasing at a very solid pace, 
reaching almost three times the figures observed one year ago. 
Moving to slide seven, you can see some relevant figures of Bancolombia a la Mano. 
Like other countries in the region, the population in Columbia lives throughout the country in several large, medium, and small cities. 
Bancolombia a la Mano targets low income individuals. 
We are actively responsible for financial inclusion and education. 
Through our financial inclusion initiatives, we provide mostly free financial services for people to access savings and credit tools to become financially empowered and improve their quality of life. 
Bancolombia a la Mano has reached almost 6 million clients. 
The income per client continues increasing. 
Transactions, especially payrolls and subsidies, remain high and loans inaudible have tripled over the last year. 
In slide eight represents our ESG framework. 
Our purpose is to promote sustainable economic development to achieve every- everyone's wellbeing. 
Therefore, we provide financial and non-financial solutions to strengthen the productivity network of our countries, 
create sustainable cities and communities, and promote financial inclusion. 
This commitment is aligned with a global agenda, 
which is to comply with the UN sustainable development goals, designed to achieve more prosperous societies and protect the planet. 
Under these three fronts of action in which we believe we can promote our purpose, 
we have already disbursed during this year 26 trillion pesos, which represents more than 20% of total disbursed. 
Now, I want to turn the presentation to Jose Humberto Acosta. 
Jose? Thank you, Juan Carlos. Now, turning to slide nine, I want to walk you through the evolution of the relief program. 
Credit reliefs continued decreasing. We are gradually returning to normal. 
This quarter, relief programs in Columbia and Panama finished. 
During the upcoming quarters, it will be key to follow the evolution of the federation, restructured loans, and charge-offs. 
Considering the geographies where the bank operates, our focus is Panama. 
The percentage of relief is decreasing gradually, but it is still 20% of the loan growth coming from 26% in the previous quarter. 
Unlike the other countries where we operate, Panama maintained a relief program until September 30. 
This situation required inaudible to allocate considerable resource to which specific agreements with clients that were under some relief is 
key during this quarter. 
As a result of this, at the end of September, only 5% of the loans under relief did not have a definitive arrangement. 
The other 15% of the loans under relief already had restructuring solutions, and if they need 
inaudible they will be transferred to the normal loan portfolio. 
On this slide you can notice not only the percentage of the loan book that is under relief, but also its compensation by segment and stages. 
On a consolidated basis, 6% of the loan book continues under relief. 
They are in turn subdivided into 50% for commercial, 21% for retail, and 29% for mortgages. 
Each composition by stages is as follows, 35% in stage one, 32% is stage two, and 12% is stage three. 
In slide 10, we explain the breakdown of operations during the quarter. 
Provision charges for the third quarter were 514 billion pesos. As we did in previous quarters, we won't explain the breakdown. 
This quarter has the lowest provision charges since the pandemic began, improving the trend we observed in the first half of the year. 
As you can notice, in the lower part of the slide, we may assume of COVID-19 and 
parameters obtained and are the main drivers behind these results. 
At the end of the relief programs in Columbia and Panama and expiration of the 94% of the relief been granted to our clients, 
we have been able to gather more and better information that allowed us to improve the methodology under which we built provisions. 
During this quarter, we have managed to reach final agreements with clients. Therefore, as they comply, we inaudible has been agreed 
and we release provisions. 
These, together with a better forecast of economic parameters have innovated a release of the balance of previous periods. 
Specific provisions inaudible in the quarter due to the recall of corporate clients of the construction sector in Columbia. 
Moving to slide 11, we give you a snapshot of provisions and asset quality. 
Cost of risk for the quarter was 1% and for the last 12 months was 2.2%, reflecting the good pace of recovery of our clients. 
If this trend continues- continues for the last quarter, it is possible that cost of risk for this year 
may be better than the guidance we gave in the second quarter of 2.3%. 
During this year, charge-offs have increased, exceeding the levels of 2020. This has two important impacts. 
First, it reduces the balance of the loan portfolio, and second, it helps reduce the level of party loans. 
We maintained solid coverage for 30 and 90 days that allow us to handle the following periods of possible deterioration. 
On slide 12, represent the consolidated and standalone capital adequacy. 
Consolidated total inaudible ratio stands at a level of 15.3%, 
while Tier 1 at a level of 11.8% under full Basel III for the third quarter. 
These ratios are well above the minimum regulatory requirements, not only in the consolidated basis but in the standalone operation. 
The growth of the shareholders' equity takes place because of the good results of this period. 
We considered that the leverage of the bank is an optimal level, given the current balance sheet risk and asset growth expectations. 
We have enough capital to support the loan book growth in the upcoming years. 
On slide 13, we present the liquidity position of the bank. 
In a consolidated basis we continue operating with a sufficient level of liquidity. 
Also, this corporate saving and checking accounts represents 56% of inaudible 
This increase has been compensated with a decrease in term deposits and credits with corresponding banks. 
As we have mentioned during the call, the economic activity in the loan book are showing better trends quarter by quarter, 
so we expect to gradually increase the balance in term deposits to support this growth. 
As a result, and with the expected hikes from the Central Bank, the cost of the deposits may increase. 
On to slide 14, we present. On slide 14, we present a snapshot of our stand-alone operations. 
In general terms, the trend through all of the different geographies operated by Bancolombia was similar, stable margins, steady growth of the loan book, increase of expenses, 
and decreasing provision charges. 
Over the last years the training the main metrics of the stand-alone operations is positive. 
The American operations were percent, 28% of profit, but 32% of net income. 
Now, I want to give you a quick overview of each of the Central American countries where we operate. 
Let's start with Banco Agricola El Salvador in Guatemala. 
This quarter, the growth of the portfolio was driven by the consumer portfolio. 
Each reflects the bank's strategy within the total portfolio mix. 
Commercial and mortgages also had a good performance in third quarter. 
The recent charges show the recovery thanks to the improvements in the reigning commercial giants, and in specific divisions. 
Banco Agricola El Salvador continued consolidated the portfolio growth that is boosting recovery. 
As an accumulated portfolio grows, both in retail and commercial segments, 
responding to the dynamics of economic recovery that the country is experiencing. And we ch- also reflect a solid recovery of free income. 
Finally, inaudible 
The positive dynamics of loan distribution begins during the second quarter continued and consolidated in the third quarter 
driven by weakened loans and the reactivation the demand for corporate lines. 
inaudible positive growth is strategy and a renewed physical assets, 
making it possible not only relevant increase, but also a change in the inaudible, where 
savings and checking accounts are being shared, improving the common cost. 
The bank continues over-performing in other tiers regarding loans and deposits growth. 
inaudible we see the evolution of margins and net interest income. 
Net interest inaudible in the 5% area as we were expecting. 
The rate hike inaudible started in September and we expect the reference rate to close 2022 in 4.25%. 
This is going to be positive for inaudible but will be reflecting the first couple of quarters of next year. 
inaudible will continue with the same pace of growth, gradually overcome 2019 fears. 
These inaudible may be treated like a reduction in the funding cost. We continue using the liquidity in a more efficient way as the dynamic of the establishment improves. 
Slide 17 shows the evolution of expenses efficiency. 
Personal expenses, excluding viable compensations, increased 1% in the cumulative figures, 
year to date. New areas of administrative expenses grew 5%. 
As a result, operating expenses as of September are 9% up, when compared to the same period of 2020. 
The main driver for expansion and expenses from 2021 inaudible related to digital transformation. 
Slide 17 shows evolution of peace. 
Net fees continue to be one of the most resilient lines inaudible, growing over 10% year to date. 
Payment and 
collections, as well as banking services, have added to the strong performance, although fees from inaudible and commercial establishments is the line with the largest contribution, thanks to increasing the volume of transactions 
the use of the Dutch Islandsinaudible. 
Slide 18 shows the profitability metrics. 
During the three first quarters of this year, we have delivered material year on year earnings growth maintaining the pace of investment in digital transformation. 
Net income for the quarter was 943 billion pesos, and return on equity is 12.7%. 
Even though provision charges were the main driver of these results, 
I want to highlight the good performance of the oldest lines of the inaudible such challenging situations, 
stable margins, steady growth of inaudible. And the fast recovery of the inaudible income. 
Finally, it is worth mentioning the impact of the tax we file in Colombia, 
which is inaudible calculation of deferred tax by generating an additional provisional inaudible. 
Now, I want to turn the presentation to Juan Carlo for the closing remarks. 
Juan? Thank-you, Jose. We are getting back to normal faster than expected. 
This quarter we were positively surprised by the bank's results. 
The country and the economy are doing better. Our clients, too. 
Bancolombia is ready to perform again with a strong balance sheet, liquidity, products, and services. 
We are looking forward to seeing you all in our Virtual Investor Day next week, 
where we will elaborate in a detailed way about our digital strategy. 
After elaborating on these key topics, we want to open the line for questions. 
Thank-you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press star then one on your touch-tone phone. 
If you wish to remove yourself from the question cue, please press star then two. If you're using a speaker phone, you may need to pick up the handset before pressing any keys. 
Once again, if you have a question, please star then one on your telephone. 
Our first question is from Yuri Fernandes with J.P Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hello. Good morning. Uh, congrats on the results and thank-you for, for the opportunity of asking questions. 
I have the first one regarding the, the asset quality to look for 2022. You already provide some color, un, in the call, but, I guess, 
the, the indicators, they were good for the quarter, 
right? And, we were concerned with Panama. Panama data was okay. 
So, so my question is, what should we expect for asset quality, uh. 
Is the worst behind? Like, what should be like the normalized level losses for, for the next year? And 
I have a second question regarding your digital initiatives. 
I guess Nequi is a very good platform, like when we look to the, to the KPIs, number us users, ratings, Google trends, you know you name it. 
But we are starting to see some peers, uh, entering, uh, the Colombian market, like some fintechs, some big ones. 
So, just like a high level view from you, uh, how do you see this competition evolving in Colombia with some players coming? 
Um, what are the, are the challenges in the market? What are you doing to prepare the company, uh, for those new guys? Thank-you. Thank-you 
for, Yuri, for your questions. Your first one regarding, uh, asset quality, and what to expect for 2022. 
Let me start by saying that we are in the process of normalizing the provision charge. 
So, the third quarter was not normal, 
was very low. We expect the fourth quarter to, eh, have some, eh, non- recurring, eh, charges. 
So, we will chip in, eh, eh, the cost of risk for 2021 around 2 
to one, 2.1%. Also, 2022, we expect, eh, to go towards, eh, a long-term cost of risk for Bancolombia, which 
should be around 1.8% or 1.9%. 
You mentioned, eh, Panama 
inaudible. But even though that we expect, eh, the cycle of normalization in Panama to be a little bit longer, 
the oher, eh, corporations should perform more in line with what we expect is going to be the cost of risk, long-term cost of risk which, as I said, 
should be around 1.8% to 1.9%. 
Eh, your second question, digital strategy and new, eh, competitors entering into the Colombian 
market, we have been preparing for this for a long time. You mentioned Nequi. Eh, we started Nequi 2015, 
eh, and now I think we hae the platform that is prepared to compete, 
eh, face-to-face with, eh, all new fintech entrants to the market. 
But, it's not just Nequi. What we have been doing is Bancolombia is preparing for this competition 
in terms of what our, eh, approach offerings, 
and how we can develop and, and evolve our products to compete, 
eh, in the market. 
Remember that, eh, Colombia, eh, has, um, regulated interest rates. We have a cap on interest rates, which 
is in, in other countries. 
So, competing in the Colombian market through interest rates is going, it's, it's difficult due to, to caps, and 
to risk. Eh, 
risk individuals is not that easy because the, the interest rate, uh, caps, eh, do not, do not allow that. 
On the other hand, we 
are also prepared to, eh, compete on the evolution of fees regarding particularly for the purpose of credit cards. 
As I, I mentioned, we have been preparing for a long time, 
diversifying our source of income. 
Eh, competition is, is going to be hard. We, we don't have, we have no doubts about it. 
But, I think we have been prepared for this for a long time. Thank-you. Thank-you, Yuri. 
Our next question is, sorry. Our next question is from Andres Soto with Santander. Please go ahead. 
Good morning. Thank-you. Thank-you for the presentation. 
My first question is a follow-up, uh, regarding, uh, cost of risk. I, I understand the guidance for the year is, um, 2, um 2.1%. That looks still, uh, pretty conservative considering that during the first, uh, 
nine months of the year, 
you, you had about 1.6%. So, that implies, uh, 2.5%, uh, cost of risk for the fourth quarter. 
And when I, um, when I look at, um, your numbers for, uh, this year, um, the quarter, sorry, 
and I normalize the, the cost of risk, uh, by the provision of releases that you had, uh, apparently what, you, you should have had is 
about, around 1.5%. So I'd like to 
understand why, why are you still conservative about, uh, the cost of, of risk, uh, expectation for, for the rest of this year? 
Thank-you, Andres. Let me, let me elaborate a little bit more on the, on the cost of risk and what we expect. If we annualize the cost of risk, eh, for the last 12 months, eh, it's 2.2%. 
And I know we have, eh, fourth quarter of 2020 in that calculation, which, eh, was, was very high. 
But, what we are expecting for the 20- I'm sorry, for the fourth quarter of 2021, 
eh, is there are some, eh, issues that are going to relieve some provision. 
For example, we need to assess if we need to recalculate the 
growth of the economy in order to introduce that number to the, to the models. 
But also, if, in a more normalized way, 
at some point it's going to reflect the, the real situation of the, of the economy, in a sense, of how the clients are, really are. 
We have also Panama. 
Eh, remember that the, eh, mark of independence September 30th in Panama, so 
fourth quarter, eh, is going to be, eh, probably higher provisions from Banistmo, which will, will reincorporate on, on, on that balance sheet. 
So the fourth quarter is going to be a mix of, eh, provisions releases, and also we need to add provisions. 
So that's why we have been conservative in the sense that provision charges for, or the cost of risk, I'm sorry, for the whole year should be around, eh, 2%. It could be less. 
It depends at the end of the performance of the clients during the, eh, fourth 
quarter in which, as I said, 
if it's more normalized and we start to see all those customers that we restructured, however, are going to pay. 
So, maybe we are a little bit conservative, but that's because there's still uncertainty in hos the fourth quarters is going to, is going to be in terms of, 
of, eh, of 
payments inaudible. Okay, Juan Carlos. My, 
my second question is regarding your loan growth expectations for, uh, 2022. 
You say that, uh, you're expecting a GDP growth for Colombia of 3.6%. 
So I would like to, to see what, what are your thoughts in terms of how this translates in terms of, uh, loan growth, uh, next year. 
And bases on this and our cur- current capital location, uh, ratios, how do you feel about your, uh, current, uh, dividend, uh, uh, distribution? 
Yeah, sure, Andres. Eh, as you, as you mentioned, 
eh, we expect the activities to grow, to grow around 2.6, 2.7% next, next year. 
Eh, so that will allow us to have loan growth around 10%, eh, eh, for the year. 
And regarding distribution, 
eh, we saw the second half of this year pick up with the growth of retail loans. 
Eh, and also, eh, in the third quarter, commercial loans started to, to pick up again, to grow. 
So, regarding distribution, we are very focused on FMEs, and, um, we expect that segment to grow faster. 
Those are commercial loans even though they control more of, uh, repayments 
in terms of, eh, eh, risk, but also in terms of, of the income that they generate. 
So we won't expect a, a dramatic change in distribution of the, eh, of the, eh, the 
loan book in terms of commercial and, and, 
and retail loans. Retail loans could grow a little bit higher, but, as I, as I said, it's not going to affect the market di- distribution of, eh, of the loan 
book. That, that's okay, Juan. What I, what I meant by distribution was dividend distribution. If you, do you expect, you know, your current- 
crosstalk Yeah. 
Thank-you. I am so sorry, Andres. Of course. So you were talking about the distribution of, of, of the, of how the- Oh, 
I'm sorry. I'm going to talk about dividends. Sorry. 
Dividends, let me, let me say this. Eh, we have a clear policy of, of dividend distribution. 
Dividend distribution has been, eh, around 30% to 50% during many years, 
and we are expecting, eh, that, uh, policy to continue. 
We will need to present a proposal to the, first to the Board of Directors, then to the shareholders meeting, 
but we, um, want only present a proposal that, uh, is going to be fully aligned. We, eh, our, our policy, long-term policy, which, as I said, is, is between 30% and 50%, of 
the net income of Colombia 
usually, because that's the one that distributes, uh, dividends. That operation is the one that, eh, distributes. 
Right. And thank-you, thank-you for your answers, Juan Carlos. And congratulations on the results. Thank-you, Andres. 
Our next question is from Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Uh, thanks for the call. I hope everyone's doing great. Um, 
I wanted to ask two questions. One is on expenses for the quarter. 
They were up, uh, a lot quarter on quarter and year on year. 
I want- wanted to hear from you if there were some 
extraordinary items there, or you brought 
forward some of expenses in the fourth quarter, and what the expectation is for the full year 
and for next year. 
Um, and then on net interest margins, 
you, you sort of like alluded to, to rising rates, and that having a positive impact on margins. I wanted to see if you could 
maybe quantify what, what do you think your margins will be, um, next year, given the, 
um, normalized level of benchmark interest rates. Thank-you. Yeah. 
Thank-you, Jorge. Eh, first one, expenses. 
The, to analyze expenses, we need to take into, take into account several, several items. 
First, eh, labor costs. Labor costs, our expenses have grown, uh, around 1%, so they are pretty much under control. 
Eh, we have the, the balance with comparable compensation, which is growing a lot, 
since we didn't have, 
eh, borrowing 
compensation, or we didn't purchase borrowing 
compensation in 2020. So the comparison, eh, eh, it's showing a very high number on that. 
On general expenses, eh, we have some, eh, extraordinary issues related to digital transformation. 
But also, those depreciations, eh, related to our inaudible. So, 
for the year, you will see numbers close to continued that we have now, 9% or 10% loan. 
But let me, let me tell you something else. We have, in Colombia, inflation that is close to 5%. 
Also, we have, eh, eh, depreciation, cost of depreciation, which is, has been close to 11%. 
So, the pressure on the, on the cost from, from that part is, it's, it's there, and it's, 
it's one of the terms that is affecting, that is affecting, eh, this for. 
So, 
we, we are not going to see, eh, a performance in terms of expenses that is going to be, eh, very good during this year, due to those 
extraordinary issues. 
We will keep our 
program in cost control and, uh, the issues of what we are doing, and we expect that to, 
eh, take 
effect in 2022. Eh, so those are our, our expectations. 
If you compare, eh… inaudible If we compare, for example, the ' 19 expenses until September, and 
' 
21 expenses, the growth is inaudible and, and 7% inaudible side because we have some inaudible regarding, as I mentioned to you, inaudible, but among normalized way, the 2020, uh, it's 
a year, eh, 
that affects the, eh, the changes in, in inaudible fuel. It was a very, a very strange inaudible 
year. Hello? Oh, inaudible regarding inaudible 
I will, I will start this, uh, question to, the question inaudible to, to elaborate on, on needs, uh, and, and grades, uh, as companies inaudible on grades 
banks, on, on the, on the need part, because it inaudible Uh, thank you, Juan. 
Regarding the inaudible, uh, as you can see, we were able to hear to sustain the mean 
at a level of 5% on inaudible, basically and mostly because of the reducing of expenses of the English rates, 
because of our deposit base. 
Next year, our sensitivity is for every 100 basis points have changed the Central Bank, our sensitivity will be at around 8 inaudible. 
That means that we are going to see an expansion of the mean, 
uh, beginning the second quarter of next year, and maybe we are going to, 
if the interest rates at the end of this year closes at a level of 4.5% to 5%, maybe 
you're going to see an expansion of mean in between 40 to 50 basis points, uh, or even more, in, in our mean portfolio. 
Remember then, that our mean is composed by lending mean for portfolio, which is 5.6% 
and securities mean, that is 0.8% and the proportion is 80%, 
20%. Thanks. 
Thanks, 
everyone. Bye-bye. We, we will inaudible in the effect until, uh, we touch along the rates increases, uh, during the next year inaudible the second quarter, third quarter 
until next, next year. Thanks, again. Our next question is from Ernesto Gabilondo, with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Um, uh, hi. Uh, good morning, Juan Carlos, inaudible Umberto. Um, Carlos, and good morning to all your team. Thanks for the, uh, presentation and for the opportunity. Um, 
I have, uh, three questions from my side. Uh, the first one is on the political landscape. 
Um, we continue to see petrol leading the presidential post. So, um, I will appreciate it if you can share with us, uh, what have you been hearing from his proposals? Um, 
I don't know what have you been hearing, if he's wanted to implement higher taxes or, or banking fees. 
Anything from what you have heard, uh, I think will be very helpful. 
Uh, and then my second question is on, uh, 
inaudible. Uh, we have seen the rest of the region developing, uh, inaudible banks, and willing to do spin-off at some point. 
Uh, so considering that you already have a good number of clients and, uh, that you are starting to become profitable, 
uh, what else do you need to consider, uh, for a potential spin-off and a listing of inaudible 
Uh, and then my last question is on your effective tax rate. Uh, we think it was high during the quarter, uh, considering the new tax reform. 
Um, so how should we think about effective tax rate for the last quarter next year? Thank you. Thank you, Ernesto. inaudible 
I'm going to take the first two questions, and I'm going to pass inaudible effective tax rates, uh, to inaudible Uh, political landscape, uh, 
it's, it's 
still early. 
Eh, we will have a, 
our, uh, first, eh, eh, inaudible on, on May, inaudible one presidential election. 
And then, uh, we have a lot of candidates. 
So, the, the political, uh, landscape is not, is not clear at, at this point. 
Eh, regarding the, the candidates and leading pawns, 
uh, we, inaudible has been, uh, around for, for a long time. He was a mayor of inaudible, 
uh, so, well, he has, uh, been a inaudible has been known for, for a long time as I mentioned. 
Regarding concrete proposals, we haven't seen yet something concrete. 
There are some comments, some inaudible, a- around, eh, some, some issues. But 
as I mentioned, still early to, to see what are the concrete proposals and what everything's going to be, the platform in, 
uh, that key or any other country, uh, are, are going to use for fuel, inaudible, 
eh, heats, inaudible to the voters. 
So I would say, Ernesto, that I inaudible to, to wait and see. 
Uh, as you know, we have a, 
a two rounds in Colombia, so there is going to be a, a the first one in each 
state is going to be probably some candidates inaudible I don't know the number but it will be 
a very high number. And then, 
we will pass the final grades, uh, inaudible between two inaudible weeks, uh. We will see. 
I think we will need to wait until next year to see, uh, a 
clear, uh, a clear, uh, a view of, of the proposals that are going to present. 
Regarding next year, we, we are, uh, as I mentioned inaudible platform, that is now growing at a very good pace. 
Uh, we have, uh, close to nine million users 
with a very, uh, with an effective, uh, uh, or, or client that used platform. 
So what we are doing, we are considering, eh, when it's the right time to start, uh, seeing the, 
uh, inaudible issue that all, 
uh, uh, the regulatory issues are covered 
inaudible what type of license are we going to do, uh, apply for. 
Uh, so there are many issues. We, we are still in, in an early stages, uh, to analyze if there is a good move for us 
or not. Uh, if there are question I, I will pass it to Jose inaudible. Jose? 
Thank you, Juan. Ernesto, as you mentioned this is a one-off. Uh, this is because of your recalculation of the, the, deferred, uh, taxes. 
And we are expecting at the end of this year the, the taxation for Bank of Colombia for the entire group will be 32% at the end of this year. 
We are expecting next year, because of the tax reform, we are going to get the level of 34%, 35%. 
And the 32% of this year, at the end of December, 
it is explained mainly because the main source of net income comes from the Bank Colombia, in which we have the higher statutory tax. 
Our next question is from Tito Labarta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning everyone. Uh, thanks for, uh, taking my question. Just two quick, uh, follow-ups actually. First, follow-up on the expenses. In terms of the efficiency ratio, 
um, yeah, given the growth of expenses, right, it picked up. How, how do you think about that, that efficiency, you know, going forward and given the investments you're doing? 
Um, could it be some cost savings with the digital initiatives sum, or is that, the expense is going to, um, sort of higher initially? 
It's tough to think about the evolution of that efficiency ratio. 
And then, to follow up quickly on the, the tax rate, should the, the tax rate just go up, you know, 
roughly 5% for the next year given the new tax rate, so it should be, like, around 35% or so, um, 
I guess in Colombia, offset by the lower tax rates in the other countries? Just to confirm for next year how that's actually inaudible. Thank you. Thank you, 
Tito. Uh, expenses 
and, and efficiency ratio. Efficiency ratio this year is, it is going to be a little bit above 50%, which is inaudible with our target. 
So we 
expect with the 
efficiency ratio to go below 50, uh, next year. And, and you mentioned our digital strategy and digital 
investments that, uh, should add efficiency to our operations. 
So, 
uh, as I mentioned in, in earlier, this is not the, the a good year to, to analyze expenses, 
since we have, uh, some extraordinary issues around, around, uh, the, the expenses. 
Uh, so we expect next year to be more of normal. 
And we will, uh, return to our, uh, uh, 
path of, uh, having a, efficiency ratios 
below inaudible 50 and looking more to mid- 40s in the midterm, which is our, our goal. 
Uh, uh, regarding, 
uh, tax rates, uh, the effective of the tax rates for 2021, 
uh, for the inaudible should be around 31%, uh, 32%, that's what inaudible 
as inaudible mentioned. And it's, uh, inaudible sort of inaudible by Colombia, uh, in which essentially inaudible you had a tax reform. 
Uh, so we need to recalculate the inaudible taxes from this year, 
and, and we inaudible on specialty tax and, du- uh, on 2021. 
After inaudible 31 we will have inaudible of the tax reform, uh, the Colombian tax reform. 
But we will increase our tax, effective tax rate, 
uh, to, or, or close to 34%, uh, mainly through then inaudible by, by Colombian. 
I don't know if inaudible Umberto would like to add something to this, 
inaudible No, Juan, that is very clear. Next year 30% to 38% including the special tax that you mentioned. That is clear. 
Okay, so just to clarify, so for next year, around 34% 
in Colombia? And then, I guess you have lower tax rates in the other- No. countries, right? So the consolidated tax rate would be- No. more or less around… Or- 
In Colombia, next year will be 35% plus the 3% inaudible then will always be maintained until 2025. 
In Guatemala crosstalk Okay, so 38- inaudible will be 25%. 
So, Tito, to clarify 
it will be inaudible effective tax rate for the inaudible crosstalk that is for 2022 should be around 34%. 
Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Our next question is from Olavo Artuso with UBS. Please go ahead. 
Uh, thank you, Jose. Thank you, Carlos and good morning, everybody. inaudible my question. 
I just wanted to understand, uh, more about, uh, this digital initiative, it's, uh, of the inaudible. 
So a few words, I would want to know what is the profile of these clients? 
Uh, I mean, how much of them are lower or high income? I know the, the focus of inaudible is inaudible. But how 
many have already inaudible accounts at Bank Colombia? What are the main products or services these clients usually demand? 
Uh, so basically it's thank you. Thank you, Olavo. 
I have some, some digital inaudible here that I'm trying, trying to answer your, your questions. 
Uh, regarding profile of inaudible and Bank Colombia, let me, let me 
inaudible. Uh, inaudible our, 
uh, 
inaudible are many, uh, 
inaudible adults between 18 and 35, 
which are, uh, usually not clients of banks. 
So they are having their first banking relation with us. 
Uh, and, uh, they are, they are using inaudible of 
savings account and also at, uh, platform to do some payments, some tranfers, 
uh, and now we are introducing loans on the inaudible, uh, platforms, uh, platform. 
So it's… And, and let me say that we have, in the case of inaudible 
40% inaudible of the clients that inaudible are also clients of Bank Colombia. 60%, 60 who 
are just clients, 
uh, of, of inaudible Uh, and, and that allow us to, to, to inaudible mix and to know and to understand very well, uh, inaudible of those clients. 
In the case of Bank Colombia inaudible in which we have close to six million clients, 
those are more clients who you do inaudible areas, uh, in a, where they ha- have access, 
uh, to banking services through our platform, and also use the, eh, eh, banking agents 
that we have, eh, throughout the country, eh more than 21,000 to do the cash in and, and cash out. 
So it's, it's a way of, uh, covering the, the inaudible with these two platforms, uh, a big part of the population. And with those numbers inaudible, 
uh, so we have close to nine million customers in inaudible and close to six million customers on, on Bank 
of inaudible so inaudible 15, uh, million customers in, in both platform. 
And, and inaudible in, in the inaudible platforms. Either you are in inaudible or you are in Bank Colombia inaudible. In the case of, of Bank 
inaudible, now we have more or less 300,000, uh, clients that, uh, already, eh, are, eh, are, have, uh, uh, credit. 
Uh, so inaudible Bank inaudible it's now inaudible in which 
clients could act inaudible, eh, to create inaudible models within, within, a, eh, increase. 
So, 
uh, that's, that's a, inaudible we call the, the clients of, of both platforms, 
uh, inaudible Okay. Not, ve- ve- very clear. 
But just to follow up on, on this stuff, like, uh, I just wanted to hear from you, uh, do you think the digital initiative is all about the banks? Uh, 
I just wanted to hear from you, wh- what, uh, inaudible what is the link of inaudible, uh, of, of Bank Colombia, 
uh, just in terms of this digital initiative? 
Let, let me, let me see if, if I, I got the question, uh, question, uh, right. 
Uh, uh, the, the digital inaudible competition, now we have a very, very inaudible um, 
inaudible to have some traditional banks that, uh, has, uh, ourself move quickly to, uh, have a, a, 
a digital platform, and 
we are competing and we are, uh, really happy to, eh, inaudible, uh, uh, options to, to clients and to the market. And we are gaining in market share. 
Those are the traditional banks which are inaudible, but we are basically two banks to do this inaudible 
And then, we have inaudible fintechs and other, and other inaudible banks. 
We have, eh, 
eh, some other platforms that are, eh, inaudible <laugh> inaudible 
basically a inaudible. I'm 
sorry. And there are some offerings around inaudible, around credit cards, eh, on, on a, on those digital platforms. And that market inaudible will increase, eh, competition, uh, during the next, uh, year for, for sure. 
On the other participants inaudible the credit, but they are not very big right now. 
So what we think is that since we started six years ago now, 
and, and we inaudible have a method and we have, uh, a base of clients that we speaking of, 
we can get advantage of, of that, and, and keep offering new products to, to those of these clients. 
So competition will increase. Uh, for sure. But, uh, we, we think are very well prepared to take advantage 
of what we have through, in this 
market. Okay. This, this is what's very clear. Thank, thank you inaudible thank you, Carlos, again. Thank you inaudible 
Our next question is from inaudible Friedman with Citibank. Please go ahead. 
Thank you very much. Uh, can you hear me well? Because I'm, uh, with earphones. Yes, 
I can hear you well. Yeah. Yeah, I can. Thank, <laugh>, thank you, Jose Umberto. Thank you, Juan. 
So, uh, hello everyone. Yeah, congratulations on the results. And, uh, I have, uh, just, uh, you know, a couple of follow-ups as well. 
Uh, 
uh, initially, uh, if you could just clarify and give me, uh, give us a bit more granularity about, uh, the reasons, uh, for, 
uh, the, uh, you know, uh, uh, eh, deferred tax rate adjustments, uh, causing, uh, a negative impact in this quarter? 
Uh, and I explain why, uh, you know, uh, my question. 
The point is that when, uh, you know, the, the taxation increased, uh, in Brazil at least, 
uh, we, uh, uh, you know, reevaluated, uh, the tax credit stock, 
uh, you know, uh, uh, appreciating that stock. 
And this caused actually a, a positive effect, 
and extraordinary positive effect in the quarter, uh, when the banks, uh, reevaluated upwards, uh, their stocks of tax credits. 
Not sure, uh, if, uh, in, in your case you had a tax liabilities and that was why, uh, you ended up having a higher, uh, deferred tax, not lower. 
Uh, so, uh, this is the, uh, uh, you know, first question, just a clarification on, 
uh, what really caused, uh, the impact that if you had, uh, tax liabilities or tax credits, uh, tax assets. 
Uh, and, uh, the second question, uh, you know, just a follow-up here, uh, you know, on the, uh, digital initiatives. 
Uh, when I look into inaudible and Alimano, uh, 
it, it's interesting because, uh, you are evolving well, uh, in both. But, uh, you know some of the KPIs, 
uh, defer, uh, quite substantially. For instance, 
uh, you are, uh, at a 65% of active u-… you are at uh 65 percent of active users, uh in Nequi, versus, uh, 
you know, 55 uh, one year ago. 
Uh, when you look into uh, you know, A la mano 
uh, it's much lower, you know, just 41 percent. And uh, this has not really increased, versus, uh, last year which was at 40, 
uh, percent. Uh, the same happened to NPS. Uh, you know, Nequi had uh, approximately 81, uh, in the case A la mano uh, you have 64. 
So just wondering, uh- uh, w- what you are seeing in terms of uh, 
challenges, uh, for A la mano for you not to achieve, uh, the same, uh, KPIs, 
uh, you know, versus, uh, what you are achieving already a Nequi? Thank you. 
Thank you Jacque. 
Let me, let me take your second question and we will inaudible your first one which is related to deferred tax and why it was, 
or 
why it 
was a negative impact. Um, Nequi and Bancolombia A la mano are- are different platforms and Nequi, it's a neobank and uh, it acts as a neobank. 
And even though it's on the, under the umbrella of Bancolombia inaudible, 
uh, it's- it's separate in terms of how it relates with the customers 
inaudible <silence> Pardon me. Just hold the line one moment while we reconnect. I think Juan is having some issues regarding the call. 
Let me, let me answer, uh, Jacque, your second question, meanwhile Juan is reconnected again. 
Uh, you're right and in terms of- of deferred tax, 
uh, when we recalculate deferred tax based on- on the new tax reform, we have three elements. 
Uh, the loan portfolio, 
the bonds, both as you mention has a positive affect on- on the deferred. But there is another element, which is the- the goodwill. 
In the case of goodwill, because we have uh- uh eight billion peso in goodwill, 
it is the other way around. And that's the reason why it affected our taxation. And you can see that 38 percent taxation inaudible 
because of the combination of these three factors. 
The first two, loans and bonds, are positive as you mentioned. 
But the third element, which is bigger than the other two, it is affecting in a negative way. That- that explains why the tax increased. 
Perfect, very clear, uh, Jose. Uh, thank you very much. Thanks. No, no, no, my pleasure. Juan you can continue with his question. I- 
I don't believe we have him back. Just one moment. <silence> 
Okay, I- I think it's Juan having- having again some issue. 
Complementing the answer of- of Juan, as- as in the previous question, we have two different profiles in Nequi and A 
la mano. And- and the- the- there are big difference. First, Nequi is more oriented to people who live in the cities 
and A la mano is more oriented to people rural, who live in small towns. 
So we complement the offer. Uh, the challenge is how we are able to maintain the activity for the first 30 days. 
And we feel proud saying that we have very positive numbers in both. 
And- and the reason is because we are using, not only to receive for example in the case of low income 
population, uh- uh, different subsidies, but also because they are actively using for transactional, uh- uh ways. 
Juan, you can continue with the, with the, with the answer. 
Now you are connected. 
Uh, thank you Jose. I- I am sorry. I had a little disconnect from the call. Uh, 
I was, I was saying, answering Jacque, and- and those- those are different platforms as I mentioned. 
So Nequi is a small neobank, uh, it's not related to banks. Uh, it's different products. 
And Bancolombia A la mano is an offering from a bank, 
uh, and targeting uh, lower income individuals with less education, so we have more challenges there. 
Uh, I- I… the inaudible active 
users that you mentioned in Bancolombia A la mano is not, it's not a bad number. I 
think it's- it's 
actually pretty good compared with- with other platforms. And- and we are measuring this as one month activity. 
Uh, and activity is uh, monetary transactions. It's not just 
uh, entering the platform to- to- to consult the uh, the balance of- of the product. It's more transactions, so 55… And 
Nequi is better because we- we have a better, uh, uh, resource on Nequi. 
And the inaudible that you mentioned, 64- 64 to 81, 64 is not bad. 
The point is that 81 is extraordinarily good, uh, in the case of Nequi. So we have challenges to keep evolving the Bancolombia A la mano platform. 
But we are very comfortable with those two strategies. 
And as I mentioned in an answer before, 
those uh, clients are- 
are inaudible so it's a total of close to 50 millions clients on this platform that are accessing 
financial products in a very simple way 
and accessing also the physical challenge of Bancolombia, which is 
a big advantage. So those, the customers on both platforms, 
uh, have access to the ATM uh, network, 
Bancolombia ATM network. Also the uh, banking agent network, which I mention is more than 21,000 
uh, 
bank agent around the country. 
That's perfect Juan. Thank you very much for the answers. Thank you Jacque. 
Our next question is from Carlos Gomez with HSBC New York. Please go ahead. 
Thank you for taking the question and for extending the call. Um, 
I want to come back to the tax issue. inaudible Uh, but just 
to clarify the last thing that you mentioned. You have a positive impact 
for um, loans and for bonds. You have a negative for goodwill. But coming back to- to what you inaudible 
if in the future we have a reduction in the effective tax rate, 
should we expect a negative impact, uh, in your result, in the short term, because of the reversal of- of what you did today? 
Uh, and the second is, when we go to next year or the year after, once we normalize, uh, your inaudible, uh, 
given how your business and the tax rates that we have, what again is the sustainable ROE that you think the bank can produce? Thank you. Thank you Carlos. 
I will take the second question, uh, regarding the sustainable ROE. Uh, we- we think that 
uh, the- the midterm ROE of Bancolombia should be around 14 percent, between 13 and 15 percent. That's our target. 
Uh, and we think we could achieve that in 2023. 
Still, 2022 will be a year we need to do some adjustments. 
Uh, it's going to be lower, double digits- 
digit ROE. 
Uh- uh, on the 2023 should be- 
be the year in which we reach uh, return ROE closer to, between 13 and 15 
percent. Jose could you, could you take Carlos better crosstalk regarding uh, certification around- around taxes? 
Yes Juan, uh, yes 
Carlos, as you mentioned, this is a one off. 
It is affecting the third quarter tax. Uh, and again, at the end of the year, we will expect the 32 percent. 
And yes, next year we will expect the 30 to 34 perfect, 35 percent tax. 
And also, obviously it will affect the profitability because we were not expecting, uh, that increase in taxation. 
But again, this is a one off and we are not going to see a recalculation of that next year, assuming that the deferred tax will maintain the same 35 percent. 
I don't know if that answer the question 
Carlos. No, the question is if in the future there is yet another tax reform, you usually have one every two years- 
Yes. uh, and this time the tax rate goes down, if- if the tax rate goes down, we should expect- Right. crosstalk one of negative impact. Right? 
Correct, that's correct. If the taxation comes down, the recalculation of goodwill will affect in a different way as you mentioned. That's correct. 
Okay, thank you. And if I can follow up on the, on the ROE question. For this year, you have a very specific, uh, outlook when we were talking at the end of 2020. 
Uh, and you were quite down, but you were expecting six to eight percent. Uh, in the end you are going to report a much better number. 
Is it mostly the asset quality or other factors, uh, now 
looking back that most of the year is gone? Uh, are there other factors that have made this year better than you feared initially? 
Carlos it's mainly driven by asset quality, uh, that was better than we expected. 
But I will, I will, I'd like to highlight that 
all lines inaudible expenses 
of the bank are- are doing pretty well. 
Uh, inaudible income uh, with the pressure that we had on margins and on interest rates, 
uh, we can handle that through the cost of funds. 
Then uh, the fees are- are performing well. 
So it's driven mainly by the quality, which is going through inaudible towards normalize number. 
But we- we had a very challenging uh, period during the 2020 and even 
2021, uh, inaudible 
bank and- and fees and net interest and 
margins inaudible perform- perform well. Thanks good, thank you so much. Thank you. 
Our next question is Jason Mollin with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. 
Hi, thank you very much for the opportunity to ask questions Juan Carlos Samberto. Uh, 
I have a follow up on the- the digital efforts on Nequi and- and uh, Bancolombia A la mano. 
I mean we're seeing this very rapid growth 
for instance in Nequi, the number of uh, of users, uh, in the quarter alone, from 7.1 million to 8.6 million. 
And then uh, on- on the Bancolombia A la mano from 5.4 million to 5.7. 
and you're showing, which is very interesting, the uh, customer acquisition cost of 33 cents at Nequi and 36 um at Bancolombia A la mano. 
If you can talk a little bit about how you're driving this growth in clients 
and uh, what is incorporated in that acquisition cost. 
And uh, you know, is that something that you know, in- in many ways I think you could say it looks very low. But just how you view that, could it be lower, could it be higher? How should we think of that going forward? Thank you. 
Uh, thank you, thank you Jason. As- as you mentioned, uh, figures or numbers are very good on our digital product. 
And- and the growth that we are seeing, it's very positive. 
And I- I'd like to- to highlight that growth is because what we are offering 
is really useful for the people that it's 
uh- uh, it- it's supplying to these platforms. 
To- 
to uh… It is very easy to be a client of one of these platforms. And once you are a client, then you can just sign in in five minutes. 
And what you need, it's your id- identity number 
and two more or three more data. 
And uh, so that explains why. And what's happening is that we are creating a network 
bank, which means that we already have the numbers and the connection with Bancolombia. So people 
are really seeing that it's- it's useful for them to have access to cash to do, to do the 
cashing through our Bancolombia uh, network. 
So at the end, it's- it's the combination of a, of a very good platform with 
easy to use product. 
Uh, with the power of the Bancolombia networks, 
ATM, 
and- and also banking agents, which allow cash in and cash out in a very easy way, a very convenient way, and all around the country. 
So that's also, that's also a way to transfer money, to do payment. 
We are also integrating now our QR uh, strategy, our QR payments strategy with Bancolombia. 
So you can use both platforms, Nequi and Bancolombia A la mano 
to do payments 
with a QR uh, in uh, in a way that allow you to use your money in a very convenient way. 
Regarding acquisition costs, we already invest in the technology 
and marketing around acquiring customers 
uh- uh, in this number of clients is also very efficient. 
So we are including the direct cost of uh, 
marketing and uh, in- in that acquisition- 
acquisition cost. We don't 
expect that number to go lower or higher. We think we are in a, in a 
figure that is uh, it's very good and we will continue seeing that- that figure in the future. 
Can you remind us again, for Nequi and Bancolombia A la mano, 
like what percentage of the clients are- are new to the banking sector or new, or are already already clients of Bancolombia, just 
to get a sense of is it converting, is that acquisition cost converting a client at Bancolombia in 
Nequi or- or Nequi, or- or how should we think about that? 
Yes Jason, 
uh, 60 percent of the clients are uh, new clients for Bancolombia in the case of Nequi. 
40 percent, four zero, are clients that are also clients of- of Bancolombia. 
So 60 percent are- are new- new clients. 
And this, also we are inaudible because that 40 percent that are clients, uh, 
common clients with- with Bancolombia, we 
have a lot of information about them, 
meaning that we can use analytics 
to really, uh, access those clients with uh- a loan offers. 
So 
it's- it's a combination. And that 60 percent are- are new. 
So that's- that's the combination that- that we have. In the case of 
Bancolombia A la mano, uh, the overlap is a little bit higher. 
Uh, but many, many of- 
of around 45 percent of the banks are new for- for the banking uh, system. So they are
