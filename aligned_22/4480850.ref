Welcome to Investors annual accounts, 2021 presentation. 
We're glad that you're joining us here today and you can join us, uh, over the phone or, uh, 
over, uh, over the web on our web, uh, site, investorab.com. 
We will soon hear our CEO, uh, Johan Forssell and CFO, uh, Helena Saxon, present the annual accounts. 
And after that, we will have a Q&A session. 
Uh, and you can pose your questions then over the phone as usual, or also in the chat on the vet. 
Warm welcome, and by that I hand over to you, Johan. Thank you, Viveka, and, uh, welcome to this, uh, quarterly, uh, result presentation. 
So, if we start on the first page, uh, 
I think we, despite all the challenges that we had during the past year, 
we did in fact see, uh, gradual improvement of the global economy, uh, during the year. 
And of course that in combination with the low interest rate environment also supported the stock market 
and the strong equity market, of course benefited Investor. 
But even adjusting for that, I think it's fair to say that 2021 was a very strong year for Investor. 
Uh, during the year our net asset value grew by more than 40% 
and I was told to share the return was up 55%. And that can be compared with the stock market in Sweden being up 39%. 
And if we look on the corresponding figure, uh, for the fourth quarter, our net asset value was up 12%, 
uh, and, uh, our total share return was up 21% and that can be compared with the stock market being up 12%. 
Importantly, I think that all overall that our companies are, uh, delivering good operational performance. 
Uh, they have been able to really manage the challenges out there, not least the pandemic and the supply chain related challenges. 
Uh, on the listed companies a number of the companies have made important strategic, uh, uh, acquisitions and investments 
during the year, uh, within Patricia. A number of the companies have made sizeable add-on acquisition and I will come back to that later on. 
Uh, the investment in EQT developed strongly during the year and was up more than 100% and the cash flow at 4.8 billion was the second best in, in the history. 
Uh, we sharpened our climate targets and we are continuously, uh, putting higher foot in sustainability, putting in our liquidation plans, and 
especially of course, uh, an extra focus is on, on the, 
the transitions that affect the number of our companies. 
Due to the strong, uh, performance during the year and also the strong financial position that we have, uh, with the leverage of less than 2%, 
uh, the board decided to increase the dividend per share from 3.50 to 4 Krona, which is an increase of 14%. 
So, a few words about the listed companies, uh, the total share of the return was up 44% in ' 
21, and it was up 11% in the fourth quarter. 
The priorities, the areas for these companies are sustainability, including the energy transition, 
innovation, technology development, and then talent management and succession planning. 
And we are spending a lot of time, of course, on making sure we have the right people in the board, in the management teams in our companies. Uh, 
I mentioned that, uh, there has been a number of important acquisitions in the listed companies, 
a few examples or Ericsson's acquisition of, uh, Vonage, uh, expanding the, the, um, uh, business into the enterprise segment. 
Uh, we had Electrolux Professional, uh, that did an important acquisition in the US. 
Uh, and we also had, uh, Husqvarna that made, uh, the acquisition on Orbit Irrigation 
and together with the Gardenia division, they would be, uh, a clear leader in that area globally. 
Uh, we had the bid on Sobi that was withdrawn, 
uh, we supported the bid in line with the, the, the board of Sobi. But, uh, the fact is that the bidder came up to 87% and not 90%, 
uh, so it did not go through. And now our focus is, he has to work close with the company 
and really make sure that we maximized the long term value creation of these fine company. 
We should not forget that Sobi has a very strong position within rare diseases, and we will be fully behind to develop the company. 
Uh, during the quarter we invested 1 billion in Ericsson, 
uh, and we, we basically took an opportunity after the announcement of the Vonage acquisition, 
uh, the stock took hit, and we, we, we saw good value and invested in Ericsson. 
Moving down over to Patricia, uh, the total return was 3%, uh, during the year 
it was down 1% in the fourth quarter, and Helena will come back to that later on. Uh, after 
Atlas Antibodies, uh, became a new subsidiary for us in connection with the acquisition of Evitria, 
uh, and the, it, it's great to see that the start has been excellent. And, uh, Evitria that was acquired, has delivered a very good performance of the acquisition. 
Uh, during the year we diverted, uh, Grant Hotel, 
and several of the subsidiaries made important add-on acquisitions, uh, that I will, uh, comment a little bit on the next page. 
Uh, we have advanced instruments that you have seen since we acquired the company, uh, roughly a year ago. 
Have actually performed extremely well ahead of our expectations when we made, uh, the acquisition. 
They recently acquired Solentim, uh, which has a very strong leading position in the niche of cell line development. 
Uh, and this company has, has had a very strong quarter, 
and the beauty here is that they both, the old advanced instrument with the osmolality testing instruments and Solentim, 
they have a significant exposure to the bio-pharma industry. 
So it's a good opportunities to sell 
this to the same customers. 
In addition, we see significant potential to, to develop on, on the R&D side, even stronger products for the future. 
Atlas Antibody, uh, I mentioned the acquisition of Evitria has built a very strong position within antibodies. 
Sonova acquired Elid-hundred, uh, which is active within AEDs or heart starters, 
uh, vulnerability, require 
strength. Uh, they are, uh, they have a very strong market share when it comes to, uh, secure mental wheelchairs in, in different kind of vehicles. 
In total, uh, Patricia has invested, uh, 6 billion in add-on acquisitions. 
And there, of course, cou, uh, couple of the other companies that have also made acquisitions, uh, smaller ones during the year. 
Uh, in the fourth quarter, we announced that we have for example, acquired air bus in China, 
and with that acquisition, they will significantly improve the market position in the Chinese market. 
If we then move to the operational performance, uh, of the company, uh, during the quarter, 
the organic sales for the subsidiaries was down 10% and the profit was down 23%. 
If we exclude Molnlycke, that I will come back to, 
uh, the major subsidiaries had very good development with an organic sales growth of 8% and a profit growth of 24%. 
But, uh, saying a few words about them, uh, Molnlycke, um, uh, 
I think it's fair to say that the development in the quarter was in line with our expectations 
and also in line with, uh, what we try to communicate in connection with the third quarter report. 
Uh, we have a situation where on the one hand, inaudible which represents a little bit more than 50% of revenues in the quarter, 
they continue to develop really well with an organic growth of 8% and strong profitability. 
On the other hand, we have, uh, more challenges during the quarter in inaudible that was down 48%. 
And, but that figure is heavily distorted by the PPE, uh, contracts that we have talked about many times. And as you can see on the short, 
the PPE contracts really peaked in the fourth quarter of 2020, and in this quarter is, was, uh, basically zero. 
That loss, uh, explains most of, of the sales loss during the quarter compared to last year. 
Uh, the other challenge was gloves, 
uh, and, and, uh, that is related to the fact that we previously had to close, uh, our plant in Malaysia that produces these gloves. 
Uh, and that has also affected, uh, the fourth quarter of last year, 
uh, this is a highly profitable product. So this also had a significant impact on the profitability in the quarter. 
If we then look forward, uh, we can split the different parts, I think, uh, uh, and, and comment one by one. 
Uh, Womb care, I mentioned good development, and we hope and expect that it will continue to develop, uh, well in the future. 
When it comes to gloves, uh, the, the plant is now up and running at 100% capacity 
but there are still transportation challenges, 
especially when it comes to transporting these gloves from the plant in Malaysia to the important market in the US. 
So you have different kind of supply chain challenges, import and transportation and so forth. 
But overall, we expect now that gloves gradually during the year will improve, 
and there is a very strong backlog and strong demand for the products. And then Rick have very strong products in this area, 
so hopefully this should gradually improve during the year. 
When it comes to the PPE contract, as I mentioned, uh, the, the peak was clearly in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
We also had some PPE sales in the first quarter ' 
21, so that will affect the next quarter, but not to the same extent as in the fourth quarter. 
And then there is a very little small part remaining in the four, second quarter of ' 21, after that it has been zero, 
so gradually this year of year effect should, should diminish. 
Saying then a few words about the other subsidiaries, Atlas Antibodies, uh, had a very good organic growth on 19%, 
uh, Evitria grew faster than the old Atlas Antibodies, uh, but both were growing in the-… Atlas Antibodies, ah, but those were growing in the quarter. 
And you can see the profitability was at a very high level and improved slightly compared to last year. 
Advanced Instruments had a very strong development with an organic growth of 18%. Ah, the acquisition that I mentioned previously, Solentim, 
ah, they are of course not part of the organic growth, but they grew significantly faster than the 18%. 
Ah, the underlying profit margin is down about 3% year over year and the main reason is that Solentim has a lower margin than the old Advanced Instruments. 
Roughly on an EBITDA level, you can say that, ah, Advanced, the old Advanced Instruments were rounding out, 
call it 50 margin, while, ah, um, Solentim is rounding out to roughly 30% margin. 
Laborie, strong development, ah, organic growth of 14%. And as you can see, also very sharp profitability improvement. 
Here we've been able to see good growth in all areas, both urology, GI, and also maternal and, and child business. 
Ah, BraunAbility ah, rec- continued to recover and, and grew by 14% in the quarter. 
Here we did see that the margin, ah, was actually slightly below last year. 
And that is mainly related to supply chain challenges that is affecting BraunAbility. 
Ah, this was partly mitigated by price increases. 
Ah, Piab, ah, grew 8% in the quarter and the profitability was down, as you can see, 
but that is mainly impacted by a write-down, 
ah, of a discontinued product line and the transaction costs related to the Chinese acquisition, Arbest that I mentioned previously. 
The underlying development in Piab is strong. 
Permobil grew 6% organically in the quarter. And this, in this quarter it was mainly driven by Europe and the US while Asia was flat. 
Ah, here we did see that the margin was down, 
ah, and in Permobil this was impacted by investment in a strategic, ah, product development product that the company is driving. 
And that was the key reason for the margin fall. 
But even if we exclude that part, the margin was actually down somewhat year over year, 
and that is mainly related to, to increased costs for supply, ah, and logistic challenges. 
Ah, Sarnova, ah, was flat in the quarter. 
Ah, and there are two key reasons for that. 
Number one, emergency preparedness business was very strong in the fourth quarter 2020 due to COVID-19. 
That was not repeated to the same level this year. 
And secondly, in this quarter 
the AAD, our heart starter business, ah, had significant supply chain challenges since they actually have chips in them. 
So that is the reason. The revenue cycle management business and acute business both grew in the quarter, 
and you can see the profitability solely. So Sarnova is also continuing to develop well underlying. 
EQT ah, of course fantastic return, up more than 100% during the year and 30% in the quarter. 
Ah, of course to a large extent driven by the strong share price increase in, in the listed company EQT AB. But as you can see, 
also the funds developed very strong returns during the year, up 70%. 
Ah, $4.8 billion in cash with the investor, as I mentioned before, that's the second highest ever. 
Ah, and there has been a very high fund activity within EQT during the year. 
And during the year they made two strategic acquisition, 
the biggest one was Exet- Exeter within the real estate market, adding about 9 billion Euro to asset under management. 
And then they also did an acquisition in Europe, ah, Life Science Partners, which is a healthcare venture cap business 
with about 2 billion Euro asset under management. 
So, ah, looking forward. 
I think that we are, ah, well positioned to continue to deliver, ah, good returns. 
Ah, and but if we try to frame it a little bit, 
ah, of course we know that, that the tailwind that we had in ' 21 with inaudible low interest rates, 
that is of course feeding through now into the start of the year. 
But we are also seeing of course a number of, of, of challenges and uncertainties. Ah, not the least the spiraling inflation that we have seen. 
Ah, and it's very clear that FED now has indicated that they will increase, ah, the interest rates. 
In addition to that, the supply chain challenges remain, 
ah, and they will remain in the first quarter. Hopefully they will then gradually be, be easing out. 
Ah, but let's see how it, how it develops, but we can see that it will continue to be supply chain challenges in the first quarter. 
And then we are, in addition to that, of course also seeing the geopolitical tensions increasing. 
Ah, we have talked about China and, and the US before, and then of course we have the situation around Ukraine. 
Ah, so all in all, ah, it, it is not unlikely, I think, that we will see some increased volatility entering 2022. 
But for us as investors, I think we are, we have a strong position. 
Ah, we have a portfolio of very strong companies in attractive markets with strong market shares. 
Ah, and we have a very strong, ah, financial position as investors. 
If there are, if there will be volatility, there will also be opportunities and, and I think that we are ready to act. 
Ah, our strategy remains firm. 
Ah, we will have the focus on our prioritized areas that I talked about before. 
Technology developments, sustainability, inaudible, ah, to, to mention the key areas. 
And then even though we have a clear strategy, clear- ah, and clear focus areas, 
I think it's important to, to highlight that we understand that we need to, to work very hard every quarter on efficiency, 
because of course the long term consists of many short terms. 
So execution, not the least, with, with all the supply chain challenges will be top of the mind, ah, during the year. 
And with that, I hand over to Helena. Thank you, Johannes. 
Okay, so, ah, let's first have a look at the adjusted net asset value. And this graph shows the development for the last, 
ah, five years. And we can see that the year ended at $761 billion in adjusted net asset value. 
And, ah, we can also see that the average annual growth with dividend added back for this five year period, amounts to 20%. 
And looking at the total return by business area, we can also see that it's quite a mixed picture. 
Ah, the smallest business area, EQT, delivered, ah, a total return of 30% in the fourth quarter, as much as 111% in the year, as Johannes already mentioned. 
And, ah, the listed companies, which is two-thirds of the portfolio, had a strong year as well, with 11% in the quarter and 44% for the full year. 
While at the same time, ah, 
Patricia had a tougher quarter. Ah, the value development -1% and for the year the total return was 3%. 
So looking a little closer at listed companies, we can see that the total amount, ah, of listed companies amounted to $515 billion at the end of the quarter. 
And while Q4 TSR was 
just below 6RX the return for the year, the total sharehold return of 44% beat 6RX of 39%. 
And of course there was a mix of performances in that portfolio as well, 
and while the Ericsson and Songfar prices development was flat, 
we saw several companies, not the least, Nostech, SCB, 
ABB, Atlas Corp Co and inaudible performing over 50% or more, 
ah, in the year. 
And then going over to Patricia Industries, ah, and the sequential development of the estimated market values in the quarter. 
Well, we already said that here was more of a flat development but still there were several companies' values that developed well and increased, 
while Permobil and, ah, Molnlycke weighed on performance in this quarter. 
And on the next slide we can see the major drivers. 
So Molnlycke's estimated market value declined by $2.2 billion in the quarter. 
Ah, this was due to lower multiples, lower earnings, partly mitigated by cashflow. 
And there was also distribution in the quarter of 50 million Euros to Patricia Industries. 
Permobil's value declined 1.7 billion due to lower multiples and earnings. 
Laborie on the other hand, was up half a billion due to higher earnings and currency effects that were also positive, but also here multiples contracted. 
And Vectura's value increased by 0.7 billion, and this was due to an increase, ah, of the value of the proper- property 
portfolio. 
Our financial position at the end of the year was very strong and the leverage, ah, declined to below 2%. 
And on the next slide, ah, I will show that we are also maintaining our financial flexibility. 
And I know you've seen these graphs before but they are now updated with a sixth year, 
and you can see that the sources of cashflow, ah, 
are several… or actually, all business areas contribute to the cashflow. 
And together they delivered 122 billion for the last six years. 
And then you might wonder, what do we use this cashflow for? Well half of it is distributed to shareholders through dividends. 
Ah, a third, almost a third is, has been used to, ah, develop the Patricia portfolio. And during this period, six new subsidiaries have been acquired. 
We've also invested in the listed companies 
and during this period we've also reduced net debt by 6 billion. 
And leverage is down from in the beginning of the period, ah, to just below 2%, as I mentioned earlier, from 7% to 2%. 
As you know, our goal is to pay a steadily rising dividend 
and the investor board has- -ly rising dividend, and the investor board has decided, uh, based on an overall strong 2021 and our financial position, to, uh, propose a dividend of four Krona per share to the AGM 
in May, 
and this, uh, dividend will be paid out in two installments of three plus one, during the year. May and November. 
So, we will end on, uh, my favorite slide, which shows the average annual total return to shareholders and you can see that 
in all these periods, we have managed to achieve our internal return requirements, 
uh, but we have also managed to out perform uh, inaudible, uh, both in the short and the long term. 
And, uh, that concludes my part of the presentation, and with that, I hand over to you, Vivica. 
Thank you, thank you Joan, and thank you Helena. We will now move over to our Q and A session. 
I know we have a few questions that have come in over the chat, uh, on the web, 
uh, but I thought we'll start out with the, if we have any questions over the phone. And by that I would like to hand over to our operator. 
Thank you. If you do wish to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad. 
If you wish to withdraw your question by pressing 02 to cancel. There will be a brief pause while inaudible. 
Our first question comes from Derek inaudible with ABG. Please go ahead. 
Yes, hello, and um, good afternoon. Uh, 
I was wondering, um, on the dividend decision, if you could just provide a, uh, a bit more clarity on the, on the background of the decision. I, 
I know that you, you strive to pay 
a steadily rising dividend, but this was actually the largest percentage increase in, in quite some time, 
if we, if we um, adjust for the um, 
the sort of pandemic, um, caused lower dividend. 
So, so I was wondering, could you just, 
uh, sort of consider the factors of the cash flows related to dividends on transa- transactions in the portfolio, how you view the investment pipeline and, and uh obviously inaudible situation, 
probably 
everything played in, but I think you only mentioned the, the uh, the leverage comment in, in the report. So, so any additional inaudible be helpful, thank you. 
I think that the, uh, the reasoning in the board regarding the dividend level was made on a holistic view. 
Uh, we had a very strong year, 
and we believed that, even though as I mentioned, there are a lot of challenges and uncertainty out there, but I think that our companies are generally in good shape. 
Uh, we have a strong year behind, uh, behind us, 
and we have a very strong financial position. Both when it comes to the leverage, but we also have a very strong gross cash position of about 24 billion. 
So all in all, the board concluded that this is the level that we believe is, is justified. 
Gotcha. And um, and uh, then I was wondering on um, 
on Swedish, if you, if you can say something about the uh, the margin, margin outlook here that was down quite a bit in the quarter, considering, 
uh, all the factors with the, the increased raw materials prices and uh, supply chain related issues, et cetera. Yeah I, 
I mean you, you know that we do, 
don't give forecast in areas that we don't know because we, we don't want to guess. 
But if I try to say a few words about what we do believe, what we see right now, and then of course what will happen in the coming months, and, and the coming year, is always difficult to, to predict. 
But I, I, I think it's fair to say that if you look on the things that really put a weight on the margin in the quarter, 
uh, and starting with gloves, 
uh, over, over the year, we clearly expect to see a clear improvement on the, both on the sales level and profitability on gloves. 
In the first quarter there will remain challenges, 
because there are still, even though the factory is up and running in Malaysia, there are still challenges to get it out to the, the customers. 
And sometimes we will have to take more expensive routes to reach the customers. 
Uh, but after that from the second quarter and onwards, we expect to see clear improvements, of course, as long as the demand level stays firm. 
But there is a good backlog when it comes to gloves. 
Uh, if you take away the PPE business, or the contract, the big PPE contract within surgical, 
uh, and you look on the remaining parts of what we call the ORS business, clothes, drapes, trays, and so forth, uh, 
I think it's fair to say that this business has been, uh, a little bit more than average, or clearly more than average hit by 
the logistics challenges. 
Uh, and, and that is something that the management team is working on, working with efficiency, finding new solutions, 
and also in, in a number of cases, actually working on the pricing, to adjust for the increased cost levels we are seeing. 
So there are clear, uh, clear plans in place to address not only the top line, but also the profitability. 
Uh, so, so uh, that is what we see, and, and uh, the management, uh, is working on, on all these areas. 
Okay, thank you. That was really helpful. 
And uh, just finally, on that, 
uh, on the, uh, surgical business, 
uh, adjusted for PPE, uh, how, how did that grow in the quarter? Apologies if, if it is mentioned somewhere. Yeah. 
No, it, it is not. 
Uh, 
but, if, if you take the ORS business excluding the PPE contracts, it was down slightly in the quarter, year over year. 
If you look on the gloves, 
year over year, it was down significantly, compared to last year. In terms of revenues. 
Thank you. Yeah. That was, um, that was all for me at this point. 
Our next question comes from Joachim inaudible with DMB Markets. Please, go ahead. 
Thank you, good afternoon. So uh, to, to follow up on Derek's, uh, initial question, 
uh, uh, can, can, can the raised dividend now 
be, 
be slightly in the light of that contract that you as late as, I mean, in the Q3 report, made a slight nuance shift to, to the dividend policy, 
because uh, I mean, obviously this will be, maybe not volatile, 
but it will shift from year to year, your upstream cashflow generation, but 
I mean, it is still, I mean you're still only so to say paying, like, roughly 50% of uh, of, of received cashflows now. 
So, can we expect more, uh, flexible dividend policy going forward that should follow the, the cashflow trajectory more? 
You should not read that there is any connection with the slightly higher dividend increase, uh, this year, uh, to the change within the, the wording of the dividend policy. 
The changed wording on the dividend policy was mainly related to the fact that we now, more and more, as you know, 
we focus on the adjusted net asset value, 
uh, while the previous, uh, while the previous dividend policy referred to book values. 
So that was the key reason for the change. 
Uh, so uh, the increase of 14% this year was more related to holistic, uh, judgment that, as mentioned earlier, that the board did based on our financial position and the overall performance. 
Worth a shot. Well uh, okay, 
so, that's fair. And uh, uh, with regards to, uh, um, I mean, uh, obviously very, I mean, well capitalized and have a solid financial position here, but 
in regards to inaudible, does this in any 
way, call it, have a, any implications for your capital allocation framework or investment priorities going into this year? 
Sorry, I didn't hear. You mean that the situation that the fact that inaudible was not divested, if that will affect, uh, our investments? Yes. 
No, uh, I, I don't think it will materially affect it. Of course if inaudible would have been divested 
over a number of years, we would have needed to step up the investment pace, 
uh, but even the strong financial position we have with a gross cash of 24 billion and, and a leverage below 2%, 
we have ample of flexibility to act on the opportunities we see, both in Patricia listed, and, and also opportunities within inaudible. 
Understood. And uh, the final one for me with regards to the fact that you bought Ericsson here, here in Q4, can you just 
uh, uh, talk a bit about them and the, the, the, call it investment process, uh, for those decisions, 
I mean uh, looking at the historical levels where you have built your positions and core holdings, it has proven to be in a quite, call it, uh, lucrative timing. 
So, so uh, how does that, uh, uh, call it, uh, framework, uh, work, and, and uh, also with regards to that, how does, 
I mean, how, how do your perceived intrinsic value of your holdings shift? Hmm. 
Thank you. 
Uh, if you take, of course we have invested in a number of companies, uh, over the last couple of years, and, 
and uh, uh, we have, we have actually been able to, to, to generate a very good return, well, about 20% on those investments. 
Uh, but if you take Ericsson as one example, 
uh, where we have increased our ownership from 5% to 8% now over some five, six, seven years. 
Uh, the initial purchases we did, we did at very attractive levels, um, 
I don't have the exact figures, but it was probably in the 50, 55 Krona per share, a number of years back. 
Uh, then the second, uh, phase, was actually in, in, in March or so, 2020, 
when we had the big setback in connection with the outburst of Corona. 
And, and at that time we probably bought at something like 65, 70. 
And, and in this case, we have acquired shares for, uh, slightly below 94 Krona per share. 
Uh, and in this case, uh, we did it after the announcement of the inaudible acquisition, uh, the stock took a hit, 
and we saw an opportunity, and we saw good value, uh, so we took it. 
Uh, and the reason why we see good value is that we think that management has done a good job over a number of years to improve the market position, 
taking a lead in, on 5G. Uh, also improved the 
profitability, and now with the latest acquisition, also expanding into new growth areas, uh, within the enterprise. Acquisition, also expanding into new growth areas, uh, within the Enterprise segments. So, it's basically it's a good value, and we, 
we can be rather flexible to act on that. 
Thank you, that's all from him. Our next question comes from Oscar Lindstrom, with inaudible bank. Please, go ahead. 
Hi, uh, thank you, uh, a, a couple of questions from me, uh, the first one is touching on, uh, I think you know, what the previous two, uh, questions were about as well, 
and that's, uh, rising input costs and, and logistics troubles and costs that were evident in Q4. Uh, 
and, and following up on that, I mean, 
to 
what extent and when do you expect to compensate, or have compensated for this, uh, through, um, price increases, 
and, and then what companies do you see this taking longer time, uh, to, to, to achieve that compensation. Now, 
I'm talking about your inaudible companies. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. It, it of course depends on both the length of the contracts in and out, and it depends on the customers and, and the, uh, the competitive situation, how much you can act when it comes to pricing. 
Uh, but, but I think it's fair to say that, that all our companies are working on this, uh, at the moment, 
uh, and in some cases of course it's easier to raise prices, and in some cases it's more tough. 
Uh, in some cases you might have stronger, bigger buyers, uh, and it might also be the fact that you have longer time horizon on existing contracts. 
And if you have that, of course you will, you will have to eat, 
uh, the cost increases in the short term, while it would take some time to get the price increases filled through. 
In other cases you can act very quickly and you can raise prices to do a bit of compensation for it. 
So it differs between companies based on these two aspects. 
Uh, but I do not want to comment on the pricing initiatives in, in, in, in the individual companies. 
But it, price management is high on our, our agenda. And the companies' agendas. Yeah. 
Just a, a, followup and see if, uh, 
I mean, are we going to see, uh, that you in Q1 have raised prices so that there's sort of a, 
you know, a couple of the companies in your portfolio where we'll see this sort of step change in pricing, or price mix if you will, 
in Q1 versus, 
um, versus Q4. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah, I, I, for sure there will be a number of our companies that will raise prices in, in the first quarter, but if I should, uh, guess how it will play out, 
I would rather say that, that supply chain challenges will for sure exist during the first quarter, and some of the price increases will not filter through, 
uh, as early as first quarter, uh, so 
I think from a timing perspective, first quarter we still, 
we still need to work very hard on these issues, but gradually over the year, 
uh, we should hopefully see an improvement when it comes to pricing out, and, and the, and the cost side. 
All right, thank you. Second question from me is, is on acquisitions. 
And you've signaled, um, we listened to you, uh, last year, or end of last year, 
you were very interested in, in making uh, acquisitions, uh, as, as uh, you know, the COVID pandemic was nearing its end 
and you, you have a greater ability to, to visit potential targets, et cetera, 
um, has that interest in making acquisitions 
shifted in any way given what we've seen since then with, 
you know, more worries about higher interest rates, increased geopolitical risk, 
has that shifted or impacted in any way your, your uh, appetite for acquisitions? 
Eh, of course we, we, we need to follow the macro environment and how that can affect the, the overall situation, but I would say, uh, basically no, because we have a very strong pipeline when it comes to the, 
uh, potential add-on acquisitions in, in our subsidiaries, and, 
and uh, we have a continued strong pipeline, uh, as I mentioned, in this quarter, 
uh, they have executed on the inaudible acquisition, and they have also executed, uh, just the other day, 
a smaller, uh, company, in uh, lifting automation in France. 
We have a inaudible that have acquired Panthera within manual wheelchairs, which are the world leader on light manual wheelchairs. 
Those kind of opportunities, we have a rather big pipeline for many of our companies. And also some larger ones. 
Uh, and we will continue to work. If we believe, uh, they work in attracting niches, 
that they are a leading player in these niches or can strengthen the position of our companies, 
and that we can acquire the company at a reasonable 
price, uh, then we will hit it. 
All right, thank you. Good to hear. Those were all my questions. 
As a reminder, if you do wish to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad. 
Our next question comes from Daniel Sward with Sword Invest. Please go ahead. 
Yes, I would like to congratulate you on a great year, and I only have one question. 
Uh, can you count on a dividend increase of half a Krona as the new normal for the years to come, 
or will you go back to raising the dividend by a quarter of a Krona, like in previous years? 
So, 
uh, there was a lost crown, so to say, during to Corona in 2020, 
does that relate to this increase now, or, or is it the new normal, 
this rise? Thank you. 
Thank you Daniel, 
and, and, and I cannot answer, uh, the question, because what will happen of course is that when we are here a year from now, 
the board will once again make a holistic view and determine what they believe is the right level on the dividend. 
Uh, our policy is to have a steady rising dividend over time. Exact how many percentage that corresponds to, uh, that, that might vary over time, 
uh, but I, I do believe that we have a strong underlying portfolio, 
both on the listed side, and on the private side, 
that generates significant cash flow, because normally we have capitalized, or we actually have very capitalized companies. 
And that of course is a strategic benefit that we have, 
that should support our dividend policy, 
but the exact levels, we will have to see where we are in a year from now. Thank you. Thank you. 
At this time there's no further questions, I hand back over to our speaker. 
Thank you. I know we have a few questions over the web, and inaudible why don't you come and, and you read them out, uh… Thank you. Sorry. 
And the first one is from inaudible of Citi, 
thanks for taking my questions too, for me, how much flexibility do you have to inaudible costs to customers if inflation and supply chain challenges persist, 
that one was already answered, I think. mm-hmm <affirmative>. So there were several inaudible this year, do you 
expect the same pace during 2022, or inaudible change for anything in that, that space? 
I can only say that we have a good pipeline, uh, when it comes to, to potential add-on acquisitions, 
and then it is, as always, it takes two to tango, and the price needs to be, be the right one. 
So it, it's actually impossible to give an answer on that one. 
Thank you. No more questions? crosstalk. Okay. 
Thank you, uh, by 
that, uh, we would like to thank you for, uh, joining us here today, 
and we will report our Q1 results on the 21st of April, so see you then, if not before. Thank you so much.
