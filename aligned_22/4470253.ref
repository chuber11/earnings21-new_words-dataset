Good morning. Good afternoon. Welcome to our online, uh, conference. We will discuss the results of the KGHM for the third quarter and for the first 
nine months of 2021. 
Apologies for the delay. Uh, unfortunately due to technical constraints, 
um, uh, we have, 
w- w- w- we had to make sure that everything runs seamlessly and we deliver the best quality transmission, that's why it took us a little bit longer. 
We'll start with, uh, quick comments on the results, 
they will be commented on by Mr. Marcin Chludzinski, the President of, uh, KGHM, Mr. Adam Bugajczuk, Vice President for Development, 
Mr. Pawel Gruza, Vice President for Foreign Assets, and Mr. Andrzej Kensbok, Vice President for Finance. 
As I said, 
we would very l- very much like to be here with you, hmm, uh, face to face, but for, 
um, uh, for concern for the health of ourselves and our people, 
we had to reduce the number of live meetings and, and choose online events instead. 
Nevertheless, 
um, after the presentation, uh, during the commentary, 
uh, we will also move on to a Q and A session. 
Uh, feel encouraged to submit your questions to er, ir@kghm.com. 
All the questions that have been or will have been submitted 
will be answered on our website as soon as possible. 
Also, the transcript of this conference will be available as well. 
I hope that we will manage to answer as many questions as possible today. 
So now, uh, let me give the floor to, to the CEO. 
Uh, hi. Hello everyone. Uh, welcome 
from Lubin, uh, on this charming, uh, charming autumn afternoon. 
Oh, actually midday. 
Uh, but let's not talk about weather. Let's talk about, uh, climate, uh, which is somehow related. 
Uh, why climate? This week, we have adopted KGHM climate policy. 
That's a sign of the times, uh, it's somehow related to EU regulations, 
but it's also, uh, a matter of, of market requirements. We want to be transparent. We want our production 
to be transparent in terms of our climate agenda. 
And we want to be in line with, um, the European climate agenda. 
That's why we adopted this document 
that defines what KGHM should do in response to climate change, and what is the, the footprint 
of the company. 
What is the impact of KGHM on the climate, 
what we want to do, what initiatives we want to take to reduce that f- footprint and to, to change the impact. 
So, that's the essence of the newly adopted document. 
There is one quite important goal in 2050, KGHM, um, is to be climate neutral. 
There will be two intermediate goals in 2030. We want to reduce our emissions by 30% versus 2020. 
And we are talking about two k- two kinds of emissions. 
We have, hmm, the range two, uh, emissions, that's emissions related to electricity production. 
So, where 
CO2 emissions are related to power generation, we want to run a number of initiatives to, to reduce those emissions. 
And the other area is the so-called, uh, range one, which is our impact, 
uh, sorry, our production, 
um, which of course generates CO2. 
So, we want to, hmm, become, hmm, CO2 neutral by 2050. 
Hmm, the agenda includes such measures as buying green energy or, uh, deployment of our own renewable energy sources. 
We want to be a more responsible consumer of energy. 
We want to use less energy, and we want to use as, um, we want to maximize the share of green energy that we use. 
In 2050, we also want to become, uh, uh, independent in terms of energy supplies. 
Hmm, when it comes to our production cycle, there are a number of initiatives such as add the mixture of 
h- hydrogen to our smelting processes. We want to use electro mobility in, 
um, in our mining operations. 
We want to use CCU and CCU 
and S, uh, so carbon capture and storage technologies. 
So the technologies that are already in place and can be deployed. 
There are also some technologies that are still in the development stage, and we hope they will be developed and they will become viable in a few years. 
So this is what we want to do. 
Hmm, the- these are the challenges of the European regulations and, hmm, requirements of, of, uh, uh, uh, of our clients. 
So, in, in a nutshell, uh, I'm talking about the, 
the here and now, so nine months into 2021. There are Q, uh, 
a number of key, uh, facts and figures. 
So the EBITDA year on year, uh, is 7.73 billion, which is greater than last year, 
uh, which is a reflection of, um, greater revenues. We, we sell at better prices, 
uh, so our revenues grew by 31%. That's 21, over 21 billion that is. 
And higher prices, the better prices are not the only factor that, hmm, has contributed to this improvement. 
We also have a 10% greater, uh, production of copper. 
Um, we have been following our, um, our, uh, plans, our strategy, 
uh, with greater production. We are immune to lower prices, 
but we are very happy to have the tailwind, we have greater prices. 
In 2019 or 2018, the prices were very low. 
In, uh, April 2019, it was $4,600 per ton, and we still managed, 
uh, we reduced our cost or we, we increased our production. 
But, hmm, these figures are the most important findings. Now, I will give the floor to Andrzej Kensbok 
who will tell you more about the finance. 
The production vice president is not with us today, 
um, because he has some health concerns. So, hmm, we won't be talking about production in detail. 
Uh, thank you very much. Good day to all of you. Hmm, let me start with a quick, uh, summary of our production output 
for metals. The good news is that pay copper has grown by 10.1%, 
three quarters of… Compared to the same period of 2020, 
all three segments of our operations 
have made a contribution. So that's domestic production from 1,412 to 40, 440,000 tons KGHM International, 
49,000 tons to 55,000 tons and Sierra Gorda from, um, 
60 to 78,000 tons. 
I will give you the details in a second, but before I do that, 
let me mention silver production, which is very important to us. 
Last year, 
uh, hmm, and the production was very high. 
We didn't actually assume such a 
great performance this year, hmm, looking at the geological, uh, parameters and the richness of the ore. 
Um, 
but the 
results, uh, um, have been very good both in terms of mining output and the content of silver in, in, hmm, in the ore. 
And also in terms of, um, hmm, uh, the recovery performance in the, the smelting operations. 
So the combined production of the whole group is 1,008 tons of silver in the first three quarters of 2021. 
Last year, uh… 
Well, when you compare this to last year figures, we can hope that w- we will solidify our, 
uh, leading position globally. We are the second largest silver producer in, 
in the world. We are very happy about that. We want to, 
uh, we want to maintain this top two position when it comes to precious metals. 
We have a slight decline, which is most of all related to the quality of ore in the US and Canada. 
Moly production has not changed. 
Um, moly content in the ore in Chile remains stable. 
Now, let's take, take a look at KGHM, Poland. Um, the other, uh, other operations will be discussed by Mr. Gruza. 
Here, we look at mining, uh, or extraction. In terms of tonnage, we have increased our output. 
Also in terms of processing, 
ore processing 
operations, uh, the output is, h- has been quite stable, uh, over last year. 
The copper content in the ore is slightly lower. 
Uh, hmm, this is related to the fact that we keep, uh, continuing our prospecting operations 
and, uh, 
th- the prop- uh, the co- copper content cannot be predicted to a very fine, um, hmm, degree of detail, to three decimal places. 
Uh, but we, hmm, we are pretty much satisfied with what we get. 
We are, we keep finding new ore deposits and we 
keep mining those areas that are most, uh, economically viable. 
Now, smelting operations, there are two important elements. 
That's maintain- m- m- maintenance of, um, smelting operations, and refinery operations at last year's level. 
Hmm, all the figures are presented in, in the presentation. 
Uh, quite importantly, uh, we have more, uh, copper production from third party ores. 
Uh, this is relat- or third 
party sources, um, because we have improved the efficiency of, um, of scrap, uh, scrap copper processing. 
And this is also the direction we want to go for in the future. 
Also in the context of our, hmm, climate policy, and we want to 
keep improving our operations in this area. And the main growth driver in silver year on year is KGHM Polska Miedz. 
Here, we have a growth from 975 tons up to 983 tons in the first three quarters of 2021. 
Now, let's take a look at Sierra Gorda International. So I'll give the floor to Mr. Gruza. 
Thank you, Andrzej. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we are happy to present these results. 
Thanks to, uh, favorable macroeconomic, uh, situation, we focused on maximizing production in all our international assets. 
Also geology has been favorable and has been a positive contributor to our results. As a result, 
uh, payable copper in Sierra Gorda has grown by nearly a third. 
Also silver has gone up. 
Obviously, we have been trying to, uh, to optimize our processing operations 
and, uh, and the costs, uh, that we, uh, that we pay in Sierra Gorda. 
Now, let's move on to KGHM International. 
Here, we also have a 13% growth in payable copper production. 
Here, the main driver is the efficiency of our mining, uh, operations in Robinson. 
In Robinson's, 
w- we've also been trying to extend the lifetime o- of the mine. So we want to keep mining in that area for the years to come. 
And production results, uh, are very good when it comes to silver. 
Hmm, some mines 
produce less, but because of their relative share, their contribution to the overall, 
um, international results is negligible. Thank you very much. 
So, let's move onto the financial results of the group. The first piece of news is the revenues. 
The revenues have grown by 31% year on year. 
Grown by 31% year in year, up to $21,735,000,000 
zloty and this improvement is first of all, related to changing metal prices. 
But there are a number of other factors, uh, that are less favorable that's a slight decrease in sales. 
First of all, in, in KGHM International. 
And that's related to certain logistic problems in US ports, 
also in dry docks, there have been so delays 
and transportation resources are less available than they used to, but this we believe is temporary. 
We also had a, um, foreign exchange differences between the Polish zloty and the dollar. 
Uh, um, it was 394, uh, the average 394 last year, now it's a 387. 
Uh, of course we keep track what's going on on the zloty and the Euro and the dollar, 
uh, 
we, uh, are looking closely at 
what's going on in foreign exchange. 
Another negative factor was the adjustment of derivi- revenues on derivatives in the first three quarter, 
the adjustment was in the area of 1. 1zł billion, 
but there is a slight difference, hmm, you know, 
because of the first three quarters of the last year. So the year and year difference is 1.4 billion 
and the positive change, the 200 million that 
greatest sale of materials other than silver and copper. 
The, the quiet leader here is the sulfuric acid that we sell, we sell more of that acid and at a higher price than last year. 
But there's also lead, uranium, selenium a number of other derivative products 
at that sell greater volumes and, or at greater prices than in the first three quarters of 2020. 
Now let's move on to unit cost. 
As you can see in the slide, 
the unit cost is significantly higher, 
but when you look at the group level, if you, um, take into account, uh, the, the, the copper tax 
and then the C1 cost would actually be lower in the first three first nine months of 2021 than in 2020, 
because the, what we all know what the, uh, the, the, the copper tax 
it is, we know the formula and you just can't beat the formula. It is rigid, uh, there is no work around. 
But when you look at the KGHM Polish Copper then the growth of the C1 cost 
net of the, uh, the copper tax 
is in the range of, uh, $0.03 per pound. 
And this is, this small growth is mostly related to growing power prices, CO2 emission rights, 
and, uh, the, the cost of, of, uh, of diesel. 
So these were the main cost drivers in KGHM International, 
well, the C1 cost is comparable. We have have a significant 
growth in 
Sierra Gorda, we have greater volumes and higher prices of, um, additional metals that actually bring our C1 cost down. 
When it comes to our operating results, 
uh, first of all, our inaudible 
uh, is significantly higher 75% greater year on year, oh, actually nine months over nine months. 
And 
here you can, uh, this is an aggregate for all the segments. So KGHM Polish, copper, international, and Sierra Gorda, 
and the main driver here is higher metal prices. And it does, uh, higher sales prices. 
It's not in this slide, but let me mention one more thing, when you were, when you look quarter by quarter, 
you will see that our quarter by quarter performance has been very stable, very constant, and the contribution of each quarter to the aggregate 
results for the three quarters has been pretty much the same. 
So consistently we have been building our results 
and also the third quarter has made a very good contribution to the, the results after nine months. 
Now, the profit or net result, 
it's significantly higher, more than three times higher for the whole group 
compared with the three quarters of the, the previous year. 
This is, uh, mainly linked to the change in metal prices and 
higher revenues. But what I also mentioned during the previous, uh, revenue conference, it was related to 
the, the evaluation 
of loans we provided to other entities, including Sierra 
Gorda, and also the measurement of interest accrued 
as well as the contrast between the negative result, uh, last year, and the positive result achieved 
this year and joint ventures 1,900,000, 000 that is the profit on involvement in joint ventures. 
What is also important is higher profit from sales 
by more than one billion from s- 
one 
billion, 165 million with, with higher copper prices, slightly lower silver sales and an increase in 
services. 
So we have been watching this, especially the net, uh, profit on the 
sales, uh, because, uh, uh, this is the core of our operations. 
There's also one thing that, oh, I'd like to mention 
that is the drop, uh, in our result on derivatives, it is related to 
the measurement of derivatives by 67 million, 
but als- million, but also in the, the low evaluation value of 150 million 
is derivatives had, uh, the impact by minus eight to one 
million on the net result. 
Uh, change in, uh, CIT exchange differences that I mentioned previously, and the CIT is Corporate Income Tax so we have high, 
higher 
profits so the taxes are also high. So the net um the result or the profit that remains is strong and robust, 
uh, and, uh, with each quarter we've seen a significant contribution to the overall profit, 
but we have to mention that, uh, the increase in the costs of energy, 
uh, those prices accelerated, uh, uh, in the last quarter by 17% quarter to quarter, 
that is how energy prices have increased. 
Uh, we have been offsetting these higher energy prices by, uh, conservational energy savings, but, 
uh, it's not possible to offset, um, such an increase in energy prices by reducing the consumption only. 
And now let me move on to our cash flows. 
So there are three important factors here. 
So the first one, 
there is the, the a- allocation of the profit home. The second is a change in the working capital, 
and that was related to I say knowingly abandoning the use of some of the factoring 
contracts. So it's 1 billion zloty. 
We see no need to use factoring in these areas, and this is how we can 
save on the costs, uh, financing costs of these contracts. 
the contracts remain valid, uh, they're in full force and in effect, uh, as our credit agreements are, 
we can use them, but we are not using them at the moment because, uh, we don't see any reason to do so, and we can save the cost. 
And another area, area, uh, is increase stock by 1.6 billion zloty compared with the beginning of this year, 
uh, the, that is, uh, related to two factors, the one, um, planned downtime and repairs. 
So we are planning to have a downtime, downtime of, uh, the suspension, 
uh, furnace, which is really a huge project. 
So we need to prepare our company to have the stock at every, 
um, stage of the process, uh, for the downtime of that important time flash furnace. 
We also preparing for other repairs, other work, 
uh, we are going to do, um, like the, uh, Arnold, uh, carousel filling machine and other, 
the major work, uh, we are going to perform. 
And the other area is the uncertainty surrounding supply chain. We have seen that a over the last couple of months where we were confronted 
with a serious breakdown in one of our concentrate 
suppliers, uh, very important supplier, and you know, how, 
uh, uh, unavailable, um, ve- vessels are for transportation. 
And in order to ensure continuous 
production of copper, we are keeping, uh, our stock at a slightly higher level, 
uh, 
because, uh, uh, we made a commitment in that respect, 
um, in the sense that we would like to test the possibility of increasing our production volume from one year to the other. 
And in order to do so, we need to optimize all production areas, including no the smelting operations, 
uh, uh, so that, uh, we can optimize that process in terms of the selection of the material and in terms of the, the processes themselves, 
so that we need to make sure that this melted plants, as well as the inaudible plant, 
have the resources to optimize production this year and next year. 
But looking at Stockholm, 
we not only thinking about long, uh, short term 
one year horizon, we looking forward long term and would like to, um, uh, streamline our production, uh, make it more efficient 
that, that, um, has not changed, uh, at the end of quarter three. 
That, that's not changed really. 
We, um, received cash from KGHM International, as I've mentioned, 
but we also, um, had a, 
um, well a situation which is, uh, stable, really not much changed. 
Uh, the only change was a slightly lower cash position. The net debt increased, but the debt, 
um, in terms of backing debt, uh, 
it's cha- it's not changed. 
Uh, so we repaid, uh, these borrowings in the second quarter, and this is why we not mentioning them. 
Let me give the floor to Adam should know. 
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Now let me focus on advancement of develop initiatives. 
Well, as for the projects fulfilled, 
uh, well, it's not so impressive maybe, but we doing that, uh, on budget and on time. 
So for example, the Southern quarter was finished, 
uh, uh, six months ahead of the schedule, which shows that we coping with the present situation. 
We all aware of the broken supply chains, 
uh, inava- unavailable materials and, uh, that all these, uh, minor challenges 
that we are facing in some smaller projects, but we 
really trying to resolve the problems as they arise and, uh, fulfill, uh, our objectives on time. 
As for the role of inaudible uh, GGP 
uh, the role is increasing, uh, by 30% years year in all areas of our production extraction and also, 
you know, the, um, copper content, um, of the head grade 
and silver is also becoming more and more important in that area. 
We have also began drilling an exploratory borehole, uh, 
for inaudible our license, the, 
and, uh, at end of the third quarter, we were drilling exploratory boreholes at inaudible so 
well, these are the results of our projects. So the Southern quarter that I've mentioned, 
which is like the dual in our crown 
and, uh, this is a very complex operation. 
Well, it's lasted more than three years and has been completed successfully. 
You know, we have, um, sent or deposited, uh, the first waste and, 
uh, we've really managed to complete that very successfully 
as for the access program inaudible has sank to 1,295 meters. We have no problems there. There's- we have no problems, no? 
And comments shaft thinking procedures are on the way for GG2. 
We have also the central air cooling system uh, on the surface and so all uh, our key projects 
here are being delivered 
on time and on budget. 
Now the energy development program including renewables. 
So we are showing the work which is underway to increase our renewables potential, you know, energy potential, including renewables. 
We uh, continue our work to increase the share of renewables and we have been doing that con- very consistently. 
As for the share of renewables in our own energy production, 
uh, that's uh, what's uh, inaudible said about our climate policy. 
All of these are tools to implement our climate policy, to bring us closer to our neutrality target 
uh, ambitious parameters so that in 2030, 
a half of our energy consumption is 
met by our own energy sources, including renewables in- in 2013, 
what Sierra Gorda will be supplied 100% from renewables. 
Uh, so that's the situation. inaudible 
Ladies and gentlemen will now- will now have a Q&A session. 
We would like to thank you for the uh, positive comments and feedback we've received from you on our climate policy. 
Before I give the floor to Janusz Krystosiak, 
let me read one question about the climate policy and not the results. The question we received 
is about page 10 in the presentation, which 
uh, says that de carbonization program for the group will be 
adopted, will we uh, hear about the details of that publicly? It will be presented the program I'm in in 2022. 
And then 
according to our information and disclosures policy information, which is significant for 
uh, investors will be made public. 
So 
now, uh, uh, we- we have also a presentation, which is inaudible uh, detailed 
presentation, which is a discussion of our climate policy. So we can also 
uh, read 
that it's important not to uh, to make a mistake here. And so the question was about the de carbonization of the group. 
So in our document, we assumed how much we emitting in our smelting and mining operations we know what to do 
uh, to 
achieve the right targets in 2030, and also to meet the zero emissions target, and also to take a comprehensive approach uh, and tackle all aspects. 
And- 
and we would like to have a big picture of the whole group uh, including our companies 
uh, and subsidiaries and 
also to 
implement the right uh, measures to achieve the zero emissions target in our subsidiaries. We know what's happening in the parent company 
and 2022 will be about the subsidiaries in our grip of companies. 
Thank you, Janusz Krystosiak, head of uh, investors relations, will have the Q&A. 
Thank you. Let me begin with a number of questions which will be about our foreign operations. 
And uh, these will be directed first to inaudible who 
inaudible investment expenditure on a big target project have been growing noticeably last quarter, uh, what 
is the scale of spending in 2022 and onwards? 
Well, uh, we not uh, projecting that 
we are in the middle of our budgeting work, and 
some of the things have not been finished. So I don't think we can tell you everything right now. 
Uh, it's clear. Okay, thank you for that question. 
So 
the CapEx on Victoria 
uh, has a different nature, there are different uh, kinds of CapEx. Some of the spending 
is to meet the local regulatory requirements in Canada, 
and the other expenditures are to ensure for our KGHM, 
uh, that we have the flexibility in our Victoria project contracts. 
And that is uh, why we have embarked on investment projects this year, 
but talking about 2022, 
we preparing uh, the budget session. So it's really hard to tell, at this point in time, 
we looking at several options that 
uh, uh, well, I mean, the options for the Victoria budget and these decisions who will be made at the board level. 
And that is why I'm not in a position to comment on that question in precise terms at this moment. 
And a question from inaudible, could we uh, 
ask you for an update on the information concerning the extraction 
uh, tax- uh, mining tax in Chile? 
Well, there's been no significant change. So far, we're waiting for the situation to develop in Chile. 
Um, we have been watching these uh, developments. 
As I've told inaudible 
what Sierra Gorda, there are 
some tax 
and legal security measures to ensure that the effects of uh, these changes, if they happen, will be 
deferred in time for Sierra Gorda. 
Thank you. 
And two more questions, uh, our foreign operations and market inaudible. 
So what are the order levels from Chinese customers? And what are the expectations uh, for demand uh, from China in 2022? 
Uh, do they fear a slowdown 
um, on uh, how the housing markets and what about green energy development in 
China and are they foreseeing any constraints in the use of energy? 
Well, uh, that's a good question. 
Well, we are in touch with the Chinese 
market by a- by uh, being in touch with a company which inputs anodes, copper anodes 
uh, to China directly. 
And we've not seen any significant slowdown in Chinese economy, uh, judging by that trading relationship, 
uh, the other areas is a concentrate market but we've not seen any problems uh, either. 
Uh, and we have seen that the- the demand for that term material from the smelters and we've not seen any significant slow down there. 
Is the increase of premium um, copper related to higher demand or maybe it's to offset the energy prices which have increased. 
Are you talking about the premium in China? 
Uh, yes I think so. 
I think there are a number of reasons for this. 
Generally there are- there is a need to supply high quality concentrate 
for smelters and that is what is driving the premium and the prices up. 
I don't know which- which uh, premium the question is about 
uh, um, okay, I see, we will ask about that and uh, provide the answer to that question on our website 
when we clarify with the asker. 
And a question from inaudible Rudnick, uh, pull 
the business newspaper, the question is about the period 
for the decision of the 
um, the preemptive right to buy a uh, block in shares in Sierra Gorda. 
Well, um, the periods are 
uh, for the board, well, the board has time until end uh, of November to announce that decision. 
So I- I- 
I would not expect a comment- any comment uh, from the board at this moment. 
Uh, all the information will be provided uh, on the decision of the board in accordance with all the information procedures. 
Yes, we've not come to the decision yet. 
Uh, the energy prices, uh, energy uh, from gas and the grid for inaudible 
Are they hedged for next year? 
And what is the scale of the cost with the same production volume for KGHM 
Poland inaudible 
Most of our demand for gas and elec- and electricity has been fixed for next year. 
I wouldn't actually say hedged. We don't use hedging or derivative instruments on energy, 
we simply use forward prices. 
So that's in the bag, so to speak. 
Obviously, we never buy 100% in advance. 
Uh, we leave some space for spot deals, because of our balancing needs. 
And because of bargains on the spot deals, and what was the second part of the question? 
inaudible What will be the scale of the cost with the uh, production scale is the same. 
Um, electricity production from our own 
gas uh, resources, well, then, here the gas price is lower 
than when we buy energy from the grid. That's where we maximize our own energy uh, production uh, assets. 
And we also keep running a prediction of energy prices both uh, from third party 
providers and from our own assets. And here the 
um, there are no clear answers because price- gas prices may change as they did last month. 
And when they do, um, electricity production 
from coal was lower than from gas despite the CO2 emission costs. 
But the situation is volatile. It changes rapidly. But we uh, keep analyzing this and we- we decide as and when necessary. 
Okay, thank you very much. We spoke about hedging. 
Uh, could I ask you to comment on uh, another question? And that's the question about 
what is the volume of copper production that are secured with contracts for 2022 and 2023. And what is the average price? 
Well, we do hedging transaction uh, transactions in accordance with our- hmm, our hedging policy. 
Uh, and this is work in progress. 
We keep- um, keep signing a hedging transactions in the third quarter. 
Most of those transactions were adjustment transactions. 
We took advantage of uh, high prices so increase at the bottom, 
uh, the bottom line of um, of transactions to secure higher prices. 
For silver, we open the top, 
at the top line waiting for possible uh, increases on silver prices which have been expected for a few years 
and have materialized to some extent 
uh, the next year is still being analyzed. We've made some range transactions. 
The average um, level of 
um, uh, hedging of our volume is in the area of 35%. 
But don't take my word for it. Maybe we'll- we'll provide a written answer. 
Okay, thank you very much. Now question from Pablo inaudible from inaudible. When can we expect uh, refreshment of KGHM's strategy? 
We've actually done that at the- the Economic Forum in inaudible 
We presented new business as initiatives uh, or en- energy policy uh, 
initiatives, those that were either impossible in 2018 or were not identified in 2018. 
So the strategy update is an ongoing process. Uh. Strategy update is an ongoing process. Uh, so whenever any new ci- circumstances arise, we do that. 
We also have a certain, um, perspective that we follow. 
And an extension of the strategic perspective is also, also possible. 
Some processes, some projects take 10 years or more, 
and, uh, they are, um, that's a living thing, and, and the process is always ongoing. 
Thank you very much. A question from Paul Biznesu, in the context of Belarus. 
If Belarus decides to, uh, suspend gas supplies, will this affect KGHM? Do you have any other, 
um, and do you have any other, uh, goods that you input from Belarus? 
Well, this is, uh, difficult situation from the perspective of state security, but it doesn't affect us. 
Uh, the gas, uh, that we use comes from deposits that are present locally. 
Uh, so our gas supplies are different than, than, than the country average so to speak. 
Of course, the volume of those deliveries is very high, 
uh, but there are no key, 
um, 
no key volumes that would be imported from Belarus, whether it's gas or anything else. Thank you very much. 
Okay. So let me go back to Mr. Gruza, a question from Santandra. 
How would you explain the excellent results of KGHM International in the third quarter? 
Well, let me say that again, 
in the beginning of the COVID crisis, we managed to renegotiate a number of cost contracts. 
We optimized, 
we optimized many investments and this reduced our cost. 
On the other hand, we maintained or sometimes we even improved our production. 
So when you combine these two factors with one more factor, that is 
the macroeconomic climate and, uh, metal prices. 
So when you do the maths, uh, you will get the, the results, uh, that you can see on KGHM International and Sierra Gorda. 
And Until this favorable microeconomic situation continues, we will be enjoying, 
uh, the benefits of it. 
2021 has been very favorable in terms of, uh, geology, both for International and for Sierra Gorda. 
Next year, there will be more challenges, uh, related to tripping, uh, in Robinson. 
We will have to remove a lot of overburden to get access to new oil deposits. 
But it seems that our operations have been optimized 
in terms of our, uh, deposit management policy. 
Thank you very much. 
Uh, apologies. I'm trying to, 
to, to eliminate duplicate questions. Here comes another, 
inaudible, what wage increases and bonus increases can be expected next year? What are the demands of trade unions as of now? 
Well, nothing extraordinary has been in happening in this regard. Uh, and I think in addition to our collective bargaining, 
so 
we, uh, adjust wages to, to the average, uh, average industrial wages, uh, coefficient. 
We don't know they're coefficient for the next year because it's published, uh, after the end of, of the year. 
So we, we don't actually try to project it, 
but year after year, we, uh, we increase the wages by, uh, what is required in collective bargaining. 
And we will be able to calculate that increase when it's published by the, the statistical office of Poland 
and what will be the CapEx related to the climate policy other than the SMR, uh, project. 
So another budget question, isn't it? 
Some of the, those, 
uh, Hm CapExes are already included in, um, in our budget, because these are the things that 
have been going on regardless of our climate policy, for instance, in 2018, 
we, uh, assume that 50% of our 
energy sources will be renewable. 
There are some projects that, that, uh, need to be counted or calculated, 
um, some of them are experimental, such as carbon capturing storage. 
So only after we investigate these technologies in indeed, they will be able to, to calculate the related cost. 
So we know some of the cost and they are included in our annual CapEx budgets, 
other costs, uh, especially those that we're looking at in the context of 2050, 
still need to go through the R & D phase. 
Then we need to select the practical solution and only then we can calculate the related cost. 
Thank you very much. inaudible Scopic as the group asks a question to Mr. Bujaiguk. 
Could you give us some detail, details 
about the, the suspension furnace, uh, renovation in Głogow I and Głogow II, 
What is the period, what is the expected downtime 
of the furnace? 
That's about, uh, Głogow II melting plant, 
and, um, um, we have been discussing about the, uh, how to optimize the downtime. 
It will be 70 something days, uh, where we dunno how much exactly. Okay. 
Another question from inaudible Scopic, 
have you seen any, uh, problems, uh, in terms of supplies of rare metals, 
uh, in the context of, um, limited supplies from China? 
Well, as I mentioned, when I spoke about our investments, we do have some minor, 
uh, problems, but we've been in the marketplace for, for 60 years and 
we have a very good understanding of the marketplace and 
we are pretty much immune to those, to those minor problems 
and everything has been going on as planned. Thank you. 
A few more questions from inaudible, Monica Barkoska. 
Actually two of them have been answered and they were about, uh, the transformation costs 
and the expected, uh, copper price levels. We don't do expectations or, or projections. 
We also don't make any projections with regards to the supply and demand situation. 
Uh, so I think we can skip at that. 
And Monica Barkoska also asks the following questions. 
The following question, what is the 2022 perspective when you look at growing energy prices? 
And maybe let's merge this question with another one, what other import and challenges other than energy prices, 
uh, KGHM will have to face? 
So, uh, the 2022 perspective in the context of, 
uh, growing energy prices and what other major challenges will have to be faced by the company? 
Well, um, we've been, uh, discussing energy at length. 
Um, we know that gas prices and diesel prices are going up. 
We know, uh, what the reason for, for higher prices is that's geopolitical situation and regulatory framework. 
So that's essentially beyond our control. What we control is adherence to our long term energy transformation strategy, 
and also our climate policy. 
So we, uh, we do, uh, we do that year after year, month after month, and we want to stick to that. 
Uh, we want to increase our energy production, our energy generation assets. 
We want to optimize, uh, the price of energy we purchase from third party suppliers. 
You know, we also reduce energy consumption whenever possible. 
Well, 2022, um, well, it's actually hard to say what it's going to look like. 
The world is changing at a very rapid pace and that pace is only increasing. 
So if you want to be a 
responsible manager, you can't actually, um, make predictions for, for the next year. 
Well, maybe the prices will go up, maybe they will go down. Hmm, uh, that's anybody's guess. 
Uh, but we can respond, uh, to any changes, we can increase production. We can, um, keep our 
cost under control. 
And that's how we deliver the financial results, which as you can see, uh, it's, uh, still pretty much okay 
despite the growing energy prices. 
And the other question was, the other part of the question, I guess you answer, uh, actually answered it. That was perspectives and challenges. 
Okay. Thank you very much. There's a question from 
inaudible, uh, 
inaudible securities, but actually we answered that question because it's a question about the cost of 
energy transformation in the context of SMRs. 
That's Robert's question. So let me answer it actually. 
We will keep reporting the next steps. Uh, so, um, the agreement with new scale on SMRs, 
oh, actually it's a letter of intent, 
um, has been, uh, signed and it defines a timeline in our obligations. 
Uh, we will report this as, and when required. 
It will cost, um, um, cost aspects have been mentioned, 
uh, when we spoke about energy transformation. 
Now, let me quickly skim through the questions. Do we have any other questions? 
It seems that we do not. 
Um, actually there are more questions, but they are about the things we spoke about. So that's it for me. So thank you very much. 
Thank you. Uh, feel free to keep submitting your questions to ir@kghm.com. 
All the questions and all the answers will be submitted at our 
website as soon as possible. Now, let me give the floor to Mr. Chludzinski for a quick summary. 
inaudible. I, uh, believe that, uh, today presentation 
has shown you direction in which we have been going in terms of our financial performance and the challenges. 
Uh, we have the answers to these, uh, challenges and how, we know how to cope with them. 
It's not possible to eliminate some of them in, uh, months, time over a year. 
Some of them require to act or 
act consistently over 10 years. This is the project of small nuclear reactors. 
All these, uh, challenges we are aware of have been strategically 
and 
noticed in 2050 zero emissions in climate policies. So we, uh, uh, assume that we can achieve that by 2050, and we see the possibilities for continued operations 
and, uh, that's very important. Uh, so let me thank the board for the presentation and thank you for your attention. 
And, uh, we will, uh, meet next time when we will be presenting the results for 2021. 
Okay. So thank you very much. 
Thanks for your attention. And we will meet, uh, uh, next quarter or next, next time for the presentation of the results. Thank you.
