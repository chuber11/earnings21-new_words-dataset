Thank you for standing by. And welcome to The PointsBet Holdings Limited Q2 FY 2022 Appendix 4C Investor Presentation. 
All participants are in a listen-only mode. 
There will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. 
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Sam Swanell, Group CEO. Please go ahead. Thank you. 
Good morning. And thank you all for joining the PointsBet Holdings Limited Second Quarter of Financial Year 2022 Business Update And Activities Report. 
This is Group CEO, Sam Swanell. And I'm joined on the call today by our Group CFO, Andrew Mellor; 
our U.S. CEO, Johnny Aitken in Denver; and our Group Chief Operating Officer, Mark Hughes, who is joining us from Dublin. 
Before we begin, please note all numbers referred to are unaudited and in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated. Turning to slide three. 
The December 2021 quarter, as well as the month of January, has been a period of great progress for PointsBet. 
During the quarter, we saw improvement in relation to many of our core financial metrics, and we've also made great strides in terms of expanding our addressable market and delivering on our product vision. 
This has been headlined by exciting launch into New York this week. 
New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States, and we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators to gain access. 
This is in addition to our launch in Virginia last month, and will be followed by our launch into Pennsylvania in February. 
These are obviously very substantial markets and allow PointsBet to leverage key NBC regional sports network assets in each market. 
We also, this week launched iGaming in West Virginia. 
We will continue to grow our total addressable market rapidly 
with Ontario, Canada likely to follow Pennsylvania. And at least a further seven States are expected to be added in North America in calendar year 2022. 
In November, we were thrilled to deliver our first major in-play product upgrade following the acquisition of Banach Technology, now known as PointsBet Europe. 
Sports betting is the product that is leading the expansion of online betting across the U.S.A. 
To win market share and deliver success in the U.S. market will require excellence in sports betting product and execution. 
As sports betting is legalized across the U.S. we anticipate that 75% of all online bets will be placed in-play, that is once a match has already started. 
Providing an elite optimized client experience in-play betting is 
beyond the capabilities of most operators who do not have modern in-house proprietary technology, combined with advanced models and automated real time trading systems. 
U.S. sports in particular continues to be poorly serviced in terms of the in-play client experience. 
PointsBet's superior optimized client experience, in particular around in-play, will clearly differentiate us from our opposition. 
The PointsBet Europe upgrade has now been applied to NFL and recently NBA. 
Further sports will swiftly follow. The impact on our NFL KPIs has been impressive and provides huge encouragement regarding the path we are on. 
In-play handle is up 44% since the upgrade, and Group COO, Mark Hughes, will speak to other impressive positive indicators later in the presentation. 
It's also worth mentioning that this month, PointsBet became the first operator in the U.S. to offer in-play betting with zero suspensions or 100% uptime 
across the core markets of NFL's spread and money line. 
Most people would be unaware that the majority of operators are operating at just 70% of uptime, meaning that when a client attempts to place a bet, the market is suspended 30% of the time. 
It's not hard to see the difference in player experience between the two outcomes, 
and thus the positive sentiment and ultimately ongoing patronage that will be earned by the superior product experience. 
In addition to in-play betting, another key product battleground is parlays, and in particular, same-game parlays. 
As such, it gives me great pride to announce that this week, PointsBet released its market-first NFL and NBA in-play or live same-game parlay. 
PointsBet same-game parlay has proven incredibly popular with our clients, 
and providing them with the opportunity to place these bets during a game, is a further example of how PointsBet is hitting its stride, leveraging the capabilities of our proprietary technology and models. 
As you see in today's numbers, it's also great to see U.S. net win increase 64% quarter-on-quarter to reflect the improvements we've made across the business. 
That improvement also includes iGaming. As is well recognized, PointsBet was late to the U.S. market from an iGaming perspective. 
We were not in New Jersey prepast the repeal like many of our competitors. 
And we took the time to build our own in-house proprietary platform as we set the business up the correct way for long-term success, 
but we are now making swift ground. In November we, we released the evolution live casino product set into Michigan, and this was completed for New Jersey in January. 
iGaming net win was up 145% quarter-on-quarter. 
And with West Virginia having launched this week, and Pennsylvania and Ontario upcoming, we will see iGaming revenues continue to climb on the back of our ever improving product suite. 
In Australia, the December quarter saw the seamless delivery of record activity across the spring carnival. 
It is imperative that we deliver a reliable, secure, and scalable system that meets the needs of our clients on peak days, such as Melbourne Cup Day. 
On Caulfield Cup and <inaudible> Day, PointsBet Australia processed over 4,000 bets per minute, up 2.5 times on last year. 
On Melbourne Cup Day, we processed over 683,000 bets for the day, setting a new record. 
This continues PointsBet's impressive record at successfully managing peak days without incident in both Australia and the U.S. 
To wrap up my introduction, I wanna return to the U.S. 
In New Jersey, we've historically operated without the benefits of iGaming revenue, and without the benefits of also being live in Pennsylvania. 
Many clients cross the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania will not use an app that is not operational in both markets. 
We have the Philadelphia regional sports network via a relationship as the official sports betting partner of NBC. 
This delivers us integrations exclusivity for all 76ers, Phillies, and Flyers games an extremely powerful asset. 
We've been utilizing this asset to reach the South Jersey audience, but we'll shortly be able to unlock its full benefits by being live in Pennsylvania. 
Following our New York launch earlier this week, we are now amongst an exclusive group of operators that will be live in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. 
In New York, we are again leveraging our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. 
SNY is the regional broadcast home of Major League baseball's, New York Mets, in addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the NFL's New York Jets. 
They offer PointsBet year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities. 
In parallel with these exciting developments, PointsBet continues to deliver on its product vision. 
Recent months provided a taste of what is to come with market leading innovation as we now leverage the hard work that's gone into building our proprietary technology and product. 
While it is disappointing to see the recent performance of our share price, 
we continue to focus on achieving our key operational priorities, investing in our proprietary best-in-class technology, and working towards our long-term growth goals. 
We'll now drill into particular focus areas. Slide four. 
Pair to the group results for Q2 FY 2021, to be referred to as the PCP, 
in Q2, FY ' 22, sports betting turnover was up 11% at $1.33 billion, 
as sports betting gross win was up 60% at $133.8 million, and sports betting group net win was up 61% at $71.9 million, 
to Q2, FY ' 22, iGaming net win of 5.4 million represented 145% increase quarter-on-quarter. 
Now turning to slide five. 
The Australian trading business continued its strong performance ending the quarter with turnover of $727 million up 34% compared to the PCP, 
and net win of $53.1 million up 7% from the P- PCP. 
However, net win was marginally lower in Q1, FY ' 22, reflecting the business' focus on promotional activity during the spring carnival. 
Gross win margin and net win margin were 12.7% and 7.3% respectively. 
Now turning to slide six. The 
Australian trading business' Q2 marketing expense was $22.6 million, 
which assisted in delivering 12 month rolling cash active clients to 31 December of 232,875, 
an increase of 63% compared to the PCP. 
To take advantage each of the latter parts of the NRL and AFL seasons, 
and the spring racing 
carnival, the FY ' 22 marketing budget was skewed towards H1 to build our brand and to acquire and retain clients over this important period of the sporting and racing calendar. 
Marketing expense in H2 will be substantially lower than H1 as we execute the strategy to front end marketing expense this financial year and leverage our fantastic shack assets. 
Now turning to slide seven. 
Compared to the PCP, Australian trading business has been in suit, has seen improvement across several KPIs. 
We saw a 15% growth of first time bettors. 
This was particularly pleasing, given 2020 saw both AFL and NRL finals shift from September to October, 
resulting in increased first time beter activity in the PCP. 
PointsBet's app download volume grew by 121.3% compared to the PCP, representing the largest gain across all major competitors. 
For context, sports betting increased volume by 34.5%, and tab by 33.9% respectively compared of the PCP. 
And PointsBet's brand awareness grew significantly. 
As mentioned earlier, I'm also very pleased to report that our in-house proprietary system successfully process rec- record betting activity through the spring racing carnival. 
We saw new peaks reach for scale indicators such as bets per minute, concurrent active user sessions, and settlements. 
Success on such big days in Australia provides the global team with even more confidence in the stability and scalability of our tech stack and trading systems as we enter into the NFL finals 
and launch in more U.S. States. 
We'll now hand over to U.S. CEO, Johnny Aitken, to provide commentary on our U.S. business. Thank you, Sam. 
Turning to slide eight. In leading off, I wanted to say that we are pleased with the trade during the quarter. 
As communicated in January 
2021, the December 2020 quarter for handle gross win and net win results was impacted by short-term, 
by trading variances, which reversed in January of 2021. 
And as such, the PCP comparison growth rates should be viewed with this in mind. 
Pleasingly, Q2 net win of 24.1 million have represented quarter-on-quarter growth of 64%. 
We remain focused on generating net win in our U.S. business, and doing so in a sustainable and disciplined fashion. 
Please refer to appendix one of the present for State by State breakdown of handle gross win and net wins. 
Handle for the quarter was 598.9 million up 72% quarter-on-quarter. Handle 
shows a decline on PCP, but please note my earlier comments on the impact of last year's short-term trading variances. 
I'd like to take a moment here to outline a very important part of our strategy. 
We are extremely focused on ensuring that every dollar of handle we book will ultimately drive value and revenue. 
In line with this, our focus is aimed at ensuring every client we acquire is capable of being about revenue generating. 
Rather than focusing on the sheer number of actives, our experienced customer intelligence and trading analytics teams are intensely focused on calculating the lifetime value of our clients, 
ensuring they are accurately and quickly profiled. 
Targeting, procuring, and retaining the right clients continues to be very important. 
PointsBet's blended U.S. online handle market share in the States we are, we are operational in 
consolidated with 4.2% for the quarter, compared to 4.5% in Q1 of FY ' 22. 
A further breakdown of market share per State can be found on slide eight. 
Cost handle is one indicator of business scale. We remain focused on growing net win. 
Our strong sense is that analysts and operators agree that the market will transition fr- from being heavily 
promotional-driven to one where the product experience is the primary driver of operator success 
combined with scale of distribution. 
And we certainly have the latter via our partnership with MBT. 
I note the heightened gross win margin that PointsBet has delivered in New Jersey compared to all other state. 
This is partly due to variance, but it's also being driven by the more advanced life cycle of the New Jersey market 
as customers adopt more diverse products, such as parlays and player props away from the traditional lower pregame margin spreads, totals, and money line bets. 
This is an encouraging forward looking trend that plays to PointsBet's innovation strengths controlled by our proprietary tech and internal trading models. 
Our quick, our quick parlay builder, parlay booster, same-game parlay, and now in-game, same-game parlay, are just the beginning of ongoing gut product feature enhancements. 
Now turning to slide nine. 
Q2 marketing expenses were 29.7 million USD. 
And I'm pleased to report that the overall U.S. working media cost per, per FDB was again under $500. 
We continue to invest in marketing and growing the brand across the U.S. 
Cash actives grew to 211,000 up 210% compared to the PCP. 
It should be noted that this metric also reflects our retention efforts, not just ac- not just acquisition volumes. 
Further, a sizeable portion of this quarter's marketing investment was into audiences outside of what was eight live State. 
This investment targeted upcoming States like Virginia, 
New York and Pennsylvania, and more broadly asked to build brand awareness and the database nationally to assist future state launches. 
We noted in the FY ' 22 Q1 call, that there was an opportunity to better utilize our tactical promotions. 
A number of optimizations were made during Q2 
refining our approach with a focus on rewarding our high value engaged client cohort and gaining an improved share of wallet from them. 
We have reinvested a smaller proportion of gross gaming revenue on the promotions in Q2 compared to Q1. 
While slightly lower than the peak seen in September and October, competition remained significant in the quarter, specifically as it related to promotional activity, 
thus, it was important to retain and incentivize our value c- 
clients with all four, the major pro sports together being active along with college basketball and college football. 
However, it should be noted that we expect to gradually bring down the rate of promotional investment further in time as we continue to focus and lead with our superior product. 
So ending to slide 11. 
We are excited by the opportunity before us this calendar year, 
as we target to be operational at least 17 States in the U.S. and also Ontario, Canada, our calendar year-end. Our 
mid-December launch of online sports betting operations in Virginia with our partner Colonial Downs, 
mark the eighth operational States for PointsBet, and one of our most successful State launches to date when looking at FTB driven from NBC properties. 
Virginia represents a large market opportunity with a population of 8.5 million, a comparable size to New Jersey, and with a rich sports history. 
Tapping over 22,000 leads at launch largely driven by our partnership with NBC and leveraging local legend and 11 time NBA Allstar, 
Alan Iverson, 
a PointsBet brand ambassador, our Virginia launch exceeded, uh, our execution goals. 
In the first week of launch, Virginia FTB acquired by NBC channels were almost five times higher than FTB acquired in the first week post 
launch in the State of Michigan. 
This launch demonstrated that we continue to improve our strategic go-to market plans that are leveraging our NBC partnership and execution capabilities. 
Viewers have been familiar with the PointsBet brands through our exclusive odds integrations and expert, e- expert analysis during key NBC television broadcast, 
including Sunday Night Football, where PointsBet brand ambassadors and NBC, NFL talent through Breys and Chris Simms, host the PointsBet post segment 
with an audience of nearly 20 million people each week. 
Notably, NBC's Washington regional sports and network affiliate is prominent throughout the region, including Maryland, an upcoming launch date for 2022, 
and serves as the exclusive regional broadcast home of the NBA's, this is Washington Wizards, and the NHL Washington Capitals. 
They're utilizing NBC's regional sports networks and owned and operated broadcast station unlocks a, a daily presence with local market teams 
and top sporting events. 
Grading a 
f- a familiarity with the PointsBet brand pride on launch. 
In that December, we were named the official and exclusive sports betting partner of the University of Mary Athletics. 
This multi-year agreement marks the first ever sports betting partnership within the storied big 10 conference, 
and follows our deal with the University of Colorado, which has provided the template to work within the, uh, the university space. 
The University of Maryland athletic spends more than 3 million funds worldwide with nearly 200,000 located in the DMV region, 
which stands for the Washington D.C, Maryland, and Virginia. 
Also as announced, on the 25th of January 2022, PointsBet launched operations in New York by representing another major milestone for our company, our brand, and our web technology. 
As Sam mentioned earlier, New York is expected to be one of the largest markets in the United States. And we are very proud to be one of only nine licensed operators in the Big Apple. 
We'll again, look to leverage our NBC partnership through SportsNet NY, a part of the NBC Sports Group. 
SMY is the, the, the regional broadcast home of the major league baseball, New York Mets. In addition to carrying supplemental coverage of the New York Jets, 
they offer PointsBet with year-round multi-platform media and marketing opportunities across its unmatched bet portfolio of events. 
PointsBet will have additional leverage opportunities as one of only six, 
uh, operators that have a New York access and official NFL partnership status. 
As we plan to Pennsylvania to launch next month, our focus will be on the significant, uh, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh markets. 
Since going live in New Jersey in 2009, we have been utilizing NBC Sports Philadelphia to reach the, the South Jersey audience. 
This includes linear imagery and integration across the Flyers, the 76ers, and the Phillies, 
which taps into their hometown affection to their teams with both, with, uh, by digital, both on their national sites, 
our geo targeted ads to New Jersey and, uh, utilizing nbcsports.com 's RSN specific website. 
As made public by the New York State Gaming Commission on the 13th of August 2021, 
PointsBet as an app- approved their platform provider, will also provide the Resort World, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Genting Group, 
with a B2B by mobile sports, so by wagering a service in the State of New York. 
This strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an, a creative and valuable partnership for the company, 
but not, but not, uh, indicative of a large B2B strategy of PointsBet. 
Aside from the unique economic opportunity got presented by the Resort World Bet of New York, PointsBet remains solely focused on our B2C sports book and our gaming operations. 
Turning to slide 12. Industry analysts keep increasing the estimated size of the U.S. online sports betting, gross gaming revenue TAM opportunity. 
As we launched new States in 2- about 2022, 
our coverage of the U.S. population. And with that, our TAM, our TAM opportunity continues to grow, uh, well considerably. 
We've seen some estimates point to an online sports spending TAM and maturity of U.S. about 42 billion. And on top of that, the U.S. 18 billion for our, for our gaming. 
We would note that horse racing is not, not commonly included in these, the U.S. TAM estimates. 
However, from our, our, our experiences in Australia, we do think there is future upside in this category to be realized in the U.S. 
hence why we bought Bet, Bet PTC, a U.S. advanced deposit horse, horse, uh, wagering business last year. 
With the recent launch in New York, the United States PointsBet is currently live and represents a total target population of 62 million people 
with an approximate sports book TAM of 10 1 / 2 billion USD at maturity. 
Adding in near term launches of Pennsylvania, 
Ontario, Louisiana, Tennessee, Maryland, and Ohio, represents a further target population of 46 million, 
an additional 6.8 billion sports book TAM opportunity. 
Turning to slide 13. 
The NBC and PointsBet partnership entered its second year at the start of September, 2021. 
And the partnership continued to dr- continues to drive results and break new ground in the category. 
It should be noted that at the end of the quarter, only 16.5% of the total NBC lead base was a direct first time bettor opportunity for PointsBet. 
However, that number will jump to an approximate by 26% from February 2022, 
once both New York and Pennsylvania are launched and grow even higher over the calendar year. 
I'm pleased with how the partnership is developing, and excited for the innovation we have planned in H2. 
The coming period will include a, a more ro- 
robust, a, a more robust sort of digital plan 
incorporating NBC's new by regional connected TV and, and over the top bet solution spot on. 
There are also additional opportunities for inclusion on their quickly growing streaming platform, Peacock. 
This combination of national and regional networks along with the local, uh, the local TV assets, gives us the ability to create bespoke, 
bespoke strategies to reach any audience. 
I'd like to now introduce our Group Chief Operating Officer, Mark Hughes, formally the CEO of Banach Technology. 
Mark began his career working for Paddy Power, now part, now part of the, now part 
of the, uh, Flutter Group, I should say, as a pivotal member of the quantitative analytics team. 
As previously noted, in-play betting is estimated to make up at least 75% in the, uh, U.S. of all sports wagering activity, uh, within the next three years. 
And PointsBet acquired Banach Technology to take advantage of this in-play opportunity. 
Mark will highlight the progress we've made in this area, again, over the quarter, uh, uh, integrating the, uh, Banach trading platform. Over to you, Mark. 
Thank you, Johnny. Now turning to slide 14. In-play is our north star. 
We believe in the value that sports betting brings in enhancing the viewing experience of a sporting event. 
And we are building a product to appeal to the users that enjoy that experience. 
We are on the journey to building an always on experience that drives customer engagement and repeat usage, 
meaning more player days, more engagement for player day, and ultimately a higher delivery of utility to the customer. 
Our data shows that in-play delivers the product experience to keep the user engaged and on apps during a session. 
Our in-play customers demonstrate higher average bet plays to bet more frequently. They have more bets per play day and ultimately a higher average revenue per user. 
Turning to slide 15. 
The launch of our enhanced in-house in-play model for NFL in October 2021, represented a big milestone for the company. 
PointsBet acquired Banach Technology in early 2021, with the intent to accelerate ambitions to deliver a world class in-play betting experience to our customers in the U.S. 
Banach Technology was founded with the vision to build a modern sports betting technology platform to support the delivery of a more enriched and quality betting experience 
for the in-play customer in the U.S. 
Since launching the new in-play NFL model, we have already seen key results when compared to the period immediately prior to release. 
Firstly, the improved betting experience.New 
algorithm has reduced the amount of time our in-play product is suspended for betting, by more than 40%. 
This results in a significant increase in volume of opportunities across time to place a bet. 
This coupled with improved bet placement journeys have led to a reduction of approximately 50% in bets rejected. Secondly, product expansion. 
We have increased fourfold, the number of betting markets our players can bet on. 
This includes the addition of player prop betting markets and the markets first in-play same-game parlay. 
We also need our customers to show an appetite to engage with this new content. 
And the early statistics have showed huge promise with a proportion of turnover outside three core betting markets increasing by 42%. 
Our users want to play this product, and we'll continue to deliver for them. 
This also offers a proportional increase in cash out opportunities for our customers. 
And thirdly, results. Our stated north star is in-play, and our hypothesis is that our product improvements will drive our users to better in-play. 
Since the launch of our NFL model, in-play is a proportion of overall NFL handle has grown by 44%. 
So continuing to push the boundaries of the customer experience and with integration of the official NFL data from Betgenius, 
we have seen further improvements in both in-play betting availability and bet delays. 
January have seen the introduction of our in-house in-play NBA product, and we'll plan a fast follow for our in-house in-play NCAAB model, and 
an overall improvement in our in-play tennis offering with the introduction of IDF tennis. 
So forecasting similar improvements on other in-house products and continue to mo- momentum towards our vision to deliver a word class in-play betting experience to our customers. 
Evidencing our progress during NBC's playoff game on Saturday 15th of January, between the Raiders and the Bengal's Wild 
Card, we are proud to become the first U.S. sports betting provider to offer clients live in-game betting opportunities with zero suspensions across the core markets of spread and money line. 
All of the aforementioned initiatives demonstrates our ability to continue to innovate and lead the market with unique and value adding products. 
Turning to slide 16. I would now like to touch upon iGaming. 
The iGaming product continues to show strong quarter-on-quarter improvement with net win up 145%. 
We were particularly excited to have launched our live dealer table solution in Michigan, in November, and New Jersey in December, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. 
Online casino products have seen a rapid product in the U.S. 
And the experience iGaming team at PointsBet is responsive to our users and eager to bring our customers the experience and gains they're looking for. 
The introduction of live theater gaming is a welcome addition to PointsBet's growing wagering product suite. 
Our live gaming options in Michigan offer top tier choices for our players and will serve as a template as iGaming expands in other jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada. 
We launched iGaming in West Virginia on January 27th, and anticipate further launches in Pennsylvania and Ontario in the coming months. 
Importantly, we look forward to the continued product improvements we have in development 
as we move to the next phase of our iGaming offering, including a significantly enhanced games library, 
automated promotional functionality, 
personalized offerings, and other innovations. 
We will continue to see online casino in customer activity and revenue generation over the coming months. I now I'd like to hand it over to our Group CFO, Andrew Miller. 
Thanks Mark. Turning to slide 17 for the quarterly four city cash flow summary. 
As at the 31st of December ' 21, the company's corporate cash balance was $523.3 million. 
Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter ending 31 December, excluding the movement in player cash accounts, was $56 million. 
I'll now walk through each of the main line items. 
Receipts from customers for the quarter totaled $90.4 million. 
This includes net win from sports book and iGaming verticals of $77.3 million as previously presented by Sam and Johnny, 
and a balance of $13.1 million includes cash receipts 
from our European B2B operations, cash receipts from our U.S. rating ADW business, 
and a partial New York license fee reimbursement received from Resorts World Bet, a subsidiary of the Genting Group, 
as part of our B2B platform provider agreement to power the Resorts World Bet's online sports book operation in New York State. 
As early presented by Johnny, this strategic B2B agreement should be viewed as an accretive and valuable partnership for the company, but not indicative of a larger B2B strategy of PointsBet. 
Cash outflows during the quarter included cost of sales of $44.8 million, which grew on the previous quarter in line with increased trading activity in both the U.S. and Australia. 
Non-capitalized stock costs of, of $18.9 million 
with growing, global FTS growing to 539 at the end of Q2, as we continue to build to scale. 
And in addition, we have support staff which are engaged by third party service companies. 
Marketing cash outflow for the quarter with $65.6 million. 
This increased quarter-on-quarter with slightly increased marketing expenses, as well as being due to the movement in prepayments and accruals from the prior quarter. 
As previously disclosed, the Australian marketing expense was 22.6 million AUD for the quarter. 
And the U.S. marketing expense was 29.7 million USD for the quarter. 
As noted by Sam, the Australian marketing expense will reduce significantly in H2, in H2 versus H1. 
And we expect the U.S. marketing expense in Q3 
to be higher than Q2 as we launch new S- new U.S. States, including the recent launch in New York, and soon to be followed by Pennsylvania, our 10th U.S. State of operation. 
Cash outflows of administration, corporate costs, and GST paid on Australian net win was $17 million for the quarter. 
Turning to investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during the quarter ending of 31 December, was 43.6 million AUD. 
The main driver of this outflow was the well documented market access payment to the New York State Gaming Commission 
of 25 million USD required to receive our New York State mobile wagering license. 
For further over the quarter, the company capitalized $7 million of technology and product staff wages as part of continued development of our sports wagering and iGaming platform. 
There was minimal cash flows from financing activities for the period, and the company has no corporate borrowings. 
At the end of December, we had $523 million in corporate cash. 
We take a disciplined approach to setting up the company for long-term success, 
investing in our unique and market-leading proprietary technology and product platform, continuing to grow the team to scale across the globe, and investing in our marketing strategy. 
I'll now hand back to Sam. Thanks, Andy. 
Turning to slide 18, slide 18. And in closing, some brief words on Canada. 
We eagerly await the announcement of an official launch date for Ontario, which is imminent. 
Not be more pleased with what has been achieved by our team led by Canadian CEO, Scott Vanderwel. 
We are dedicated to delivering a brand and an experience that is genuinely Canadian. 
The deals that we have executed with Dailyfaceoff.com and the nation network, Carling Canada, 
the National Hockey League Alumni Association, and the Trailer Park Boys, are all true to this strategy. 
We are extremely confident in the efficiency of the cut throat these partnerships will deliver to grow brand recognition and acquire clients. 
In launching PointsBet Canada into Ontario, 
the Canadian team will leverage not only the proprietary technology and market leading product that the company has built, 
but also the global scale we now possess with a one team approach supported by staff in numerous continents. 
Thanks for your time. And we'll now take questions. Thank you. 
If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. 
If you wish to cancel your request, please press star two. If you're on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. 
The first question comes from Rohan Sundram from MST Financial. Please go ahead. 
Hi team. Uh, I might start with a question for Sam. 
Just how are you thinking about the long-term share asp- aspirations of the business in light of the ongoing increases in estimated North America TAM? 
So w- would you be happy with say a 5% share of a, a 70 billion market as opposed to say 10% of a 30 billion market? Is that how you're thinking about it? Thank you there, Rohan. No, 
I think… Look, our, our aspiration remains to, to work towards that 10% market share. 
I think the reality is, is what we thought, you know, in terms of a marketing budget that would us to achieve that, 
um, is now effectively probably a marketing budget that's more akin to achieving a, say a 3% or 4% market share. 
Because as you've sort of drawn the link to, the, the size of the market has grown dramatically and, and the size of the estimated size of the future market. 
So our competitors are being far more aggressive in line with that, and they're being far more aggressive from a promotional perspective. So, you know, I suppose our relative budget, 
if you think about us spending, you know, 27 last quarter and a little bit more this quarter, 
the market was probably spending close to a billion dollars those two quarters on marketing. So we're probably spending about 3% of what the market's spending for marketing. So it's a bit unrealistic 
for us to expect at this stage in the current environment to be, to be heading, you know, rapidly north towards that 10%. But as, you know, 
I suppose as we assume the market transitions, you know, it was interesting hearing Adam, um, the CEO of MGM, BetMGM yesterday or the day before, talk about 
maybe there's another 12 months of, um, you know, this heightened aggressiveness in the market, may be one more start of NFL season, but then their expectation is that perhaps things ease off a little bit. 
Um, and we probably, we probably agree with that. 
And in line with that, you know, obviously we are continuing to make rapid progress on our product strategy. So we think those two things combined, 
improving our brand. We're investing in our brand, we're investing in building data 
bases. Um, while it may take longer to get to that 10% 
given the, the growing TAM and the, and the amount that's being spent, you know, we still plan to get there as the market transitions to being more product-focused. Okay. 
Thanks. 
And, and on the New Jersey share, I know it's not the, the main game, but I take into account the, the reduction there in turn over, but given the high net win, how would you share look on a, a net win basis, especially given the first quarter was almost 8% net win. 
Yeah. Well, I mean that, New Jersey's a very good example. So, you know, from a market share perspective, we came under a bit of pressure again, but from a net win perspective, net win quarter-on-quarter was up to 
24%, you know, so that's, that's a good example. We want to keep growing, growing net 
win. Now, if that's a smaller proportion of the market that we thought would be, that's in some ways a positive cause again, it talks to the fact that the market is bigger than most expected and, and is growing more rapidly. Um, 
Johnny made a comment during, 
um, his part about the fact that, you know, New Jer- Jersey now, it's becoming a bit of a trend that it's gross margin yields are yielding higher than our other States. 
And, you know, we look, we look at the reason behind that. 
And as he said, some of it is some variance, but, but some of it is definitely some differences in player behavior in terms of that slightly more mature market now cause it's been open a bit longer, players gravitating to the higher margin products, the same game parlays, the player props, et 
cetera. And we think, again, that's a positive trend for us 
because it shows that they're moving into the, let's call it the, the sweet spot for PointsBet, because this is where we aim to lead in terms of having the most engaging, 
um, product set. Thanks, Sam. 
Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Duff from SIG. Please go ahead. 
Uh, good morning, everyone. Um, you know, you, Sam, you talked about New Jersey, you know, Indiana and Michigan were, you know, the States, 
the bigger States that you have exposure to in the third quarter where you lost share. But, um, 
I guess the expectation rightfully, wrongfully, it would take a while to build those back, given the advertising and the promotional, uh, environment, but you were able to rebuild in Michigan. I was wondering, can you describe or talk about, you know, maybe some of the methods that you use to, 
to recapture some of that lost share in the fourth quarter ver- I'm sorry, in the, 
um, fiscal second quarter versus the first quarter? 
That's the first question. And then I wanted, um, to ask about customer acquisition costs. Um, 
Johnny, you had mentioned you guys are still, uh, running about $500 or so. 
And with your newer launch dates in Virginia 
and Pennsylvania in a month, or, you know, in February and, and New York, and your ability to rely on your RSNs, your NBC RSNs, 
would it be fair to assume that, that customer acquisition costs could come down in those particular markets? 
Hi Joe. Um, so in terms of Michigan, look again, I think the pleasing thing for Michigan, yes, our sports betting market share did go up, but again, even more importantly, 
I think we had 700,000 of net win last quarter and this quarter was so like 3.2 million. 
So again, really good growth in Michigan from a net, a net win perspective. Um, you know, 
I think obviously when you've got the casino products improving, 
uh, you know, when we, when we think about States that have a mix of sports betting and iGaming, 
you really do have to look at them in, in totality 
because it goes without saying that if client, um, 
goes and loses some money playing blackjack, well, then that's perhaps less money that they have to turn over on sports betting. So the two are, are generally related and thus, when you're looking at New Jersey, uh, Michigan, and, and soon to be West Virginia and Pennsylvania and States with, with mix, 
you have to look at the combined result, 
um, not, you know, with, there's, there's a difference if you just have sports betting to, to having sports betting, uh, and iGaming. 
Johnny, is there anything you'd wanna say about, um, Michigan in particular? 
I'd just add Sam that, ag- again, we view every State, a State as its own not country, and each State sort of differs in terms of the dynamics 
and how, again, consumers consume sport, the population, the, the distribution. You know, a market like Michigan is very unique. 
Uh, and in that particular, you know, we're seeing, I guess, the early results of our, a very smart investment with, um, O- uh, Olympia Entertainment. 
So they, um, owned the arena where the Pistons and the Red Wings play. 
We made a smart investment into building a sports bar 
next to the main entrance of the stadium. And when you've got at least 82 home games of NBA, NHL, and people are walking past the PointsBet brand going in and out of the arena and going in there and having a drink, 
it played a role in making sure the PointsBet's part of the yellow boost sporting fabric there, and part of the consideration when people in Michigan and Detroit is thinking about where to play the next bet or sign up. 
Thanks, Johnny. Yeah. In terms of the CAC, Joe, I mean, 
you know, we spent, and, and Johnny made a comment about this, we spent 20- 29.7 million on marketing, and that last quarter was similar in terms of, 
um, because we were waiting to launch in Vir- in, in Virginia. 
And we knew that we had upcoming launch and we were waiting 
q- q- you know, quietly confident of a positive outcome in New York. And again, confident of a positive outcome with licensing in Pennsylvania. 
It's been a strange couple of quarters because a, a fair chunk of our marketing budget has gone into the Washington RSN, the, the Philly RSN and, and SNY in New York. 
So as those States go live, Virginia, now New York and, and soon Pennsylvania, 
you know, that, that spend goes from being sort of out of State to, to being in live States. 
And so that proportion of, let's call it somewhat spend that was going outside and maybe less efficient. Yes, it was building the brand and, and warming those States up. That then comes in States. So 
I don't necessarily, I wouldn't necessarily say that taxes are gonna come down because we're now, um, going, um, you know, live into those States, 
but we certain- certainly do believe that those, it's, it's been the model that we've used, obviously in, in Chicago that, 
um, you know, we're never gonna outspend these big guys at the moment, but, you know, the audience watches live sport. 
You know, we've got Philly, 76ers, all the teams that Johnny spoke about, the Mets in, in, in New York, et 
cetera, um, getting in front of those eyeballs through those RSNs, we think is a very efficient, uh, mechanism to grow our brand and, and acquire clients. 
Thank you guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from Desmond Star from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hello. Hi, team. Um, 
I've just got a couple of questions around slide, uh, 14 and 15. I think you guys provided some interesting detail, 
uh, on those two slides. 
Um, you know, obviously I think Mark noted a couple of industry-first achievements by the business in the U.S. and obviously now with Banach and the rise of in-play. 
I was wondering if you can just talk a bit more about the opportunity that in-play presents, and then more specifically, whether you have a sense of market share within in-play. 
You know, would it be fair to say that your share of the in-play market is actually far greater than the blended 4.2% share that you talked to today? 
Good question. Um, yeah, 
I think in terms of the opportunity, yeah, I want, I really want this to be clear in terms of stepping through the dynamics of the U.S. market. 
Um, you know, we've, we've been at, at a disadvantage because we didn't come from an iGaming background. 
Most of the companies that we're competing against… New Jersey legalized iGaming back in something like 2013. 
Um, so all of, most of our competitors have been operating iGaming in America, in one State at least, and maturing all of their products and practices for, for some time, 
you know, pre-past them being repealed. 
Um, add to that, as I said, the fact that we took the time to build our own platform, because we wanna, we wanna own it, we wanna keep the margin for the long-term. You 
know, we have been at a competitive disadvantage from a product set perspective, but also from a revenue perspective of, of not having had, um, having had that product. 
But as we think about, you know, forward-looking States, you know, I think it, it needs to be clear that all the States that are going live now and launching, are all sports betting only. 
So iGaming expertise is not gonna necessarily get you, get you anywhere if you don't have sports betting expertise. 
And our, obviously our blueprint is to win our market share on the back of our sports betting expertise. 
And then when iGaming does get legalized, you know, two years later, or three years later for a particular State, 
we've already got, um, hundreds of thousands of clients and we can cross-sell 40% of them or whatever that number is, to iGaming, 
versus, you know, someone who was focused on iGaming, well, they won't have any market share. 
Um, if they don't have a proprietary sports betting product, 
um, they're, they're not gonna win that market share in those sports betting States. 
But within, you know, that earning of market from sports betting, 
I don't think there's, there's any operators out there that aren't talking about, um, a 75% in-play, uh, market. 
Uh, so, so everyone's, everyone's agreeing that 75% of sports bets will be placed in-play. And, 
you know, we are on a path to, we believe, leading, um, within that sector. Now we wanna lead within the entire product sector. 
So we want to have the best product full stop, and that includes, you know, improving our iGaming product. 
Um, but, you know, leading the way and now starting to deliver on, 
um, some of our product vision. 
Part of the challenge when you build something from scratch, you know, and we built, we've built this tech stack from scratch, even in Australia 
and, you know, at, at the start with not a lot of resources, it, it takes time to, to deliver things. 
Um, and we're now getting to the point where, um, you know, we, we are delivering. 
You know, we're starting to innovate as, you know, 100% uptime in-play, in-play 
same-game parlay, et cetera. So when it comes to, you know, the in-play vision and how important it's gonna be for winning market share and ultimately succeed in the U.S. I don't think anyone's 
in= in- indoubt with that. And, and 
I hope, you know, um, the market is starting to see how PointsBet, um, 
is already leading in this category, but is gonna put the foot down and continue to, um, you know, to really, um, put a gap on there. 
Um, in terms of market share, in-play market share, I'll throw to, I'll throw to Johnny. But I would just say, 
um, perhaps, you know, I, I think it's still a customer journey, and that's what we were talking about from the, from the New Jersey perspective 
that, 
you know, the market is still very focused on the promos, et 
cetera. It'll, it'll gradually, um, gravitate to be more product-focused. 
And then there's the second part to that is though, as clients get a little bit more sophisticated as we're seeing in New Jersey and they branch away from the core bet types 
into, you know, uh, more creative bet types and higher margin, uh, bet types. But Johnny, do you a feel for whether you believe we're already over indexing from, uh, in-play perspective? Yes, Sam. 
I think I, I think the true sort of read through will be, um, sort of, sort of Q3 onwards, this quarter and onwards. 
And the reason being there that, again, in Q2 
we, we saw NFL and NBA move on to our, our, uh, internal trading feeds powered by, uh, the Banach Technology. 
And so now sort of for each quarter ahead, we'll get a true read of, of the power that drives. 
You know, one of the things I think is misunderstood by, um, the market is that it isn't just about competing for in-play on 
the number of markets you have. 
Um, it isn't just about building play pops and micro markets. 
Really, the core tenet of offering an in-play experience that 
drives repeat that usage and allows you to lean in on, on your product over sort of, again, sort of covering, 
uh, maybe with gaps in the product with heavier sort of promotions, 
centers around being up, up the longest, 
again, you know, sort of aiming towards that zero sort of betting suspensions and giving consumers that complete experience to place a bet, to cash out their bet, 
uh, without, again, um, you know, the moment when the, the market are rather suspended. 
And then the second tenet is around the speed, uh, to accept the bet. 
Again, you know, we sort of know that our competition in general applies 7 to 10 second bet delay, um, when any in-play bet is placed. 
And then after that 7 to 10 seconds passes and the bet is then, um, pinged again to the trading, uh, software that's being used externally by a lot of our competitors, 
50% of the time, the bet's being rejected due to a price change, or again, due to the market being suspended. 
Again, you know, we're, uh, again, actively working and sort of backing in the models, 
um, that have been delivered by Banach sort of backing in, again, the pricing efficiency that we have, that we have the confidence to, to, uh, recontinue to put as many clients as we can on zero bet delay. 
And so not only matching, again, as I said, that, that sort of, um, you know, sort of uptime goal to, again, continue to increase that, 
but also accepting bets, 
um, you know, in sort of lightning speed. And if we're up the longest and quickest to accept, 
we think that combined with our product features and then the, again, distribution of the message of PointsBet being, uh, the king of in-play particularly across the NBC platforms. 
Again, it's gonna be a huge ongoing driver of client activity for business. 
Great. Thanks Sam. Thanks Johnny. Appreciate it. That's all for me. Thank you. 
Your next question comes from Larry Gava from Credit List. Please go ahead. 
Hi, team. A few questions for me. Um, 
Sam, just in New Jersey, uh, I, you know, hearing how you guys evolved, um, you know, the management of that, uh, offering there. 
Um, can you talk to whether that involved a churn of customers or is it, did you migrate existing customers into new patterns, 
um, how that play out? And is this, uh, sort of first date? How come you didn't sort of take this approach in Illinois yet? Is it just a different cir- circumstance there? 
Okay, Larry. Um, 
I think across the, across the business, you know, we made 
a comment and I think Johnny referenced it again, that last quarter, we probably didn't focus enough on our existing clients or our high quality clients and, 
um, with our, with our promotions and focused on, you know, the acquisition period. And 
I think, you know, we, we, we do wanna focus on quality clients, 
uh, without wanting to… Everyone's got their own strategies, but, you know, there's… Acquiring clients, um, is not hard. 
You know, we, we can run promotions and, um, give away money and just acquire client, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of those clients are gonna be of, of value. 
So we are trying to find the, the balance. Um, and I think that's the message, you know, coming out that, yes, um, we will keep growing, 
but we wanna keep growing, um, responsibly. 
Um, so if, you know, adding another 10,000 actives or 20,000 actives, if those actives are, 
are no good and that, then that's the same in terms of churn. There's no point trying to hold onto some clients if they're just, they're just genuinely not, not genuine. 
Um, then, then, you know, we make, we make no, uh, apologies for, for doing that. 
So, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't sort of say that we're actively, um, you know, targeting, um, segments or, 
you know, disconnecting from certain segments, apart from unprofitable segments, 
you know, clients that are just not gonna be worth anything. 
Uh, and in terms of Illinois, no, it's, it's very similar. 
Um, it's, it's, it's very similar. The strategy's the same. You know, it's about, it's about a focus on value continue to grow. 
It's just the dynamics work out that in, in New Jersey, we grew revenue by that 24%, um, quarter-on-quarter, lost a bit of market share. 
Um, in Illinois, we were able to continue growth without losing that market share, but the s- the strategy is consistent. 
Hmm. Okay. Excellent there. And, um, with New Jersey, just continuing on that, um, I think you did about 15 million of net win in the half. Let's 
say we annualize that in a bit more. 
New Jersey's been funding, um, marketing for new States, but if we kinda withdraw that new State support, 
um, are we getting it close to break-even in New Jersey alone to sort of isolate just New Jersey marketing? 
Yeah, I think, I think we are, uh, Larry. You know, I mean, I think when we do 10.8 for the quarter, I would rather times that by 4, 
um, because the iGaming product has come in and that wasn't necessarily, um, present in, in, in previous quarters. You know, there's a few… 
There's a lot happening in New Jersey. There's a lot of market dynamics still there. 
So I'll, I'll call out a few. 
You know, obviously going live in New York and being, 
um, one of, um, an exclusive group that will be live in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, will be helpful going live in Pennsylvania. We spoke to that, that Philly audience. 
The continued growth of the iGaming product, um, is gonna be vitally important. 
But, you know, I think, um, I think by the middle of next year, um, you know, we think New Jersey is, is turning profitable. 
So, um, you know, post the, the pass bar cessation of sports, you know, sport came back- 
COVID. middle of post- COVID in the middle of 2020, sort of had to restart the business. 
And so, you know, we think by the end of next financial we're, we're turning profitable. Okay, great. 
Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Don Carducci from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Morning, everyone. 
So just a couple quick ones from me. So if I think about the net new active customers, where did they, they come from? 
Uh, was it the new markets or was it maybe those markets that you had been in for 12 months or more? 
Hey, Don. Yeah. I mean, look, obviously we acquire clients in all, in all new markets. The difference being that in a market like New Jersey, where you have been, uh, live for some time, 
you also churn clients out, out the back end. 
So the increase in active clients is a, is a net effect. 
It's what you've added. Obviously the increase we've acquired more first time bettors than that increase in actives, but we've also churned some clients in the backend. So that's the, 
that's the net, the net effect. 
Yeah, no, g- got it. I understand that. 
So I guess if I rephrase the question, I mean, you, you have churn. 
Is the majority of this churn coming from new States or is it coming from the existing States that you've been in for 12 months or more like New Jersey, Iowa, Indiana? 
Yeah, no, by, by the definition, because we're giving a 12 month rolling number, it has to be States that we've been live in for more than 12 months, 
because if we've been live in six in, in, um, a state for six months, for example, um, all of those clients would be in the 12 month active number. 
Gotcha. And then can you give us a little bit of clarity on like the cash guidance maybe for next quarter, 
um, include, you know, license payments, et cetera. Obviously Pennsylvania, that's a, that's a steep one, uh, New Jersey, but just kind of a little bit of guidance on what we should expect for that. 
Yeah, sure Don Sandy. 
You know, I think, and just talk to, to, cashburn 
generally, you know, we're continuing to build obviously for the long-term and investing in this opportunity, particularly in the U.S. and, and the product. 
Um, and that is requiring a reasonable level of upfront investment, 
as you mentioned, the, the market access requirements, licensing requirements, and the marketing investment, which I think that's pretty, pretty well understood as we roll out into, into new States. 
As, uh, as it relates to, um, the market access, access payment, obviously this was a, a larger payment that we made in New York, which was 25 million US in Q2. 
Um, the payment required for Pennsylvania, uh, is 11 million USD, which, which will be paid in Q3. 
So the business development payments for, for Q3 will be lower than, than Q2. Gotcha. Thanks team. 
Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
