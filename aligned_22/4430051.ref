Let me now present our CFO. 
Foreign language 
Good afternoon, this is Poong Young Yoon, CFO of SK Telecom. First of all, let me express my appreciation to investors and analysts for their continued support. 
Foreign language 
On April 14, SK Telecom announced that it was reviewing a plan for a spin-off, 
which would result in a telecom company and a holding company with semiconductor and new ICT assets. 
Foreign language 

We plan to use the spin-off to increase shareholder value and create the most optimal structures for our telecom business and new ICT businesses respectively thereby accelerating their growth. 
To fulfill the purpose of the spin-off, we completed the cancellation of treasury shares 
worth 2.6 trillion won in market value, which accounts for 10.8% of the total issued stock. 
Foreign 
language 
The planned spin-off was designed to prioritize shareholder value, and we believe that we have gained a good understanding of the investors and the market. 
We will carry out the plan with a strong conviction and make sure that all the necessary decisions are finalized within the first half of the year. 
Foreign language 
Now let me discuss the consolidated earnings highlights for Q1 of 2021. 
Foreign 
language 

Consolidated revenue for Q1 of 2021 recorded 4 trillion, 785 billion won. 
All business divisions enjoyed growth year-on-year, and media and safety and care posted a double-digit growth, marking a 7.4% year-on-year increase. 
But the figure declined 1.2% Q-on-Q due to the base effect of higher seasonal sales in Q4. 
Foreign language 

Consolidated operating income increased by 29% year-on-year and 17.4% Q-on-Q to post 388.8 billion won. 
MNO and media led the operating income improvement by achieving both revenue growth and cost efficiencies. 
S&C and commerce also contributed to earnings with their Y-o-Y growth in operating income. 
Foreign language 
Net income recorded 572 billion won, posting an 86.9% growth year-on-year and a 54.2% growth Q-on-Q 
thanks to equity method income on SK Hynix and sales profit of SK Wyverns. Foreign language 
Let me now discuss major achievements and strategic direction for each business. 
Foreign language 
Non-consolidated MNO revenue for Q1 increased by 1.9% year-on-year and 1.4% Q-on-Q 
to post 2 trillion, 980.7 billion won. 
Celebrating the second anniversary of 5G on April 3, we saw the number of 5G subscribers reach 6.74 million as of the end of Q1 
and record the biggest quarterly net adds, 
thereby leading MNO revenue growth. 
Foreign 
language 
MNO operating income posted 307.3 billion 
won, a 19% growth year-on-year and a 33.1% growth Q-on-Q as the market stabilization trend continued. 
Foreign language 
Recently, we introduced five new 5G price plans to strengthen the 5G price options. 
They include three online only on-tech plans that offer more benefits at lower prices 
and two additional 5Gs plans at 69,000 won and 79,000 won. 
We will continue to promote the transition to 5G services based on the variety of price plans that cater to diverse customer needs. 
Foreign 
language 


Subscription services newly pursued by MNO division are expanding partnerships and launching diverse subscription services for daily lives, including education, rental and F&B. 
In the second half of the year, we plan to introduce integrated subscription services based on a new subscription marketing platform 
where customers can enjoy optimal subscription life at reasonable prices. 
We're developing flagship products that will raise customers' expectations for subscription services. We will do our best to ensure high quality of these services. 
Foreign 
language 


Moving on to Media. SK Broadband's consolidated revenue recorded 967 billion won. 
With the T-broad merger and IPTV subscriber growth, it rose by 17.6% year-on-year but declined by 4.1% Q-on-Q due to the base effect of seasonal sales in Q4. 
Thanks to revenue growth and operational process improvements, 
operating income increased by 98.8% year-on-year and 12.6% Q-on-Q to record 75.4 billion won. 
Foreign language 


As for safety and care business, with the merger of ADT Caps and SK Infosec, we changed the name of the division from Security Division to Safety and Care Division to expand the scope of business. 
After the merger, the consolidated revenue, including ADT Caps, recorded 350.5 billion won. 
It increased by 20.3% year-on-year thanks to the solid growth of new businesses such as home security, integrated security and cloud security, 
but it declined 5.5% Q-on-Q due to the characteristic of safety and care business in which revenue tends to peak in Q4. 
The new businesses enjoyed both top line growth and bottom line improvement resulting in the quarterly operating income of 27.8 billion won, a 9.4% year-on-year and 14.9% Q-on-Q increase. 
Foreign language 


Commerce revenue posted 203.7 billion won. 
It increased by 7% year-on-year based on the continued contactless consumption trend but decreased by 9.3% Q-on-Q 
due to concentrated promotions in Q4, including the 11th day event. 
Marketing expenses for 11th Street and SK-Stoa increased in Q1, but operating income maintained the BEP level thanks to volume growth. 
Foreign language Next, Hyoung-il Ha, Head of Corporate Center II, will discuss the achievements and strategic direction for the new ICT businesses. Foreign language Good afternoon.

Foreign language 

Established by SK Broadband in January as a multiple program provider, Media S began regular broadcasting in April. 
In partnerships with Kakao Entertainment and SM C&C, 70% of the programs are exclusive content unavailable on other TV channels. 
Foreign language 
SK Broadband will strengthen the value chain in the media business that encompasses content, channels and platforms.

will further 

enhance competitiveness of original content such as Taxi Driver that is enjoying high viewer rating. 
We recently hired chief producer, Chan-ho Lee, well-known for dramas such as Signal and Stranger 
as Chief Content Officer and we're in the process of establishing a content planning studio. 
Foreign language 
Next is the Security Division which is renamed as Safety and Care Division.

In addition to achieving growth in the existing security domains, 
we will expand technology based business models in new security domains, such as securities for home, unmanned stores and cloud. 
Foreign Language 

ADT Caps recently signed an agreement to cooperate with AWS for cloud security business. 
By combining ADT's cloud security services with AWS solutions, 
we will promote business together to gain market share in the financial and public sectors where there is high demand for transition to cloud. Foreign language 
Also, we're in the process selecting a lead underwriter for IPO of ADT Caps, and we will do our best to prepare for the IPO. Foreign language

It is also selling popular products, including daily necessities in partnerships with major domestic and brands such as Amora and PNG Korea. Foreign language 
In collaboration with Amazon, we're making preparations to allow customers to buy Amazon products on the 11th Street. 
We plan to announce more details as soon as the service is ready to be launched.

Yuan. Foreign language UTI was launched through joint investment of Tina mobility and Uber 
and it's differentiated services are expected to offer customers more choices and provide drivers with more revenue. 
Foreign language 
Finally, let me move on one store, which is preparing for an IPO. 
Foreign language 
With continued GMV growth for 11 consecutive quarters, one store received investments from KT and LG Uplus 
thereby solidifying its position as Korea's representative at market. Foreign language 
We acquired Rock Media and established the content studio as a joint venture with Yes 
24, all of which are our efforts to secure K content IPs and develop them in a variety of formats. Foreign language 
I will now hand it back to the CFO. Thank you. Foreign language 
Thank you, Mr. Ha, for your presentation. 
Foreign language Dear investors and analysts, we are pleased to have delivered earnings that exceeded the market consensus in this quarter. We announced a spinoff plan and canceled treasury shares to enhance shareholder value. 
We also demonstrated that the fundamentals in all our businesses have been strengthened. 
Foreign language 
I understand that many people want to know more about our dividend policy. 
After final decisions concerning the spinoff are made at the board in the first half of the year, we will share with you more details, including a decision on the quarterly dividend. Foreign language 
We will continue to do our best for successful spinoff. Let me reassure you that all the decisions we make will be to maximize shareholder value. Foreign language 
We ask for your continued support and interest. Thank you. 
Foreign language Foreign language 
Now the QA& session will begin. Please press one and four if you have any questions. 
Questions will be taken according to the order you have pressed the number one and four. Please press one and five if you want to cancel your questions 
Foreign language 
The first question will be provided by inaudible from Korea Investment and Securities. Please go ahead. 

Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like to ask two questions. 
The first question is regarding the spinoff plan, um, Wave and Flow were not mentioned in your recent disclosure. 
So I'd like to learn how these businesses and subsidies, 
other subsidiaries will be divided between, uh, the survival, the surviving company and the spinoff company after the spinoff. 
The second question is related to your subscription service plan. You mentioned that in the second half of the year, you are going to launch an integrated subscription service. 
So can you provide us with some updates on your subscription service business plan? 
Foreign language 
Mr. O thank you very much for your questions. Foreign language 
Let me first answer your question regarding where, uh, Wave and Flow will go after the spinoff. 
Foreign language 
After the spinoff, the surviving company will grow as an AI-based front company by combining the fixed and wireless telecommunication infrastructure and pursuing growth based on AI-centered subscription marketing and data center business, 
Foreign language 
And the spinoff company will grow as an ITT investment company that is specialized in making aggressive investments in semiconductor. life platforms and global tech seeding, 
thereby making various investments that will, uh, drive value up. 
Foreign language 

In your question, you asked about Wave and Flow. They belong to media and content assets thereby falling under the life platform area. 
So under the spinoff company, they will become global businesses that will lead new lifestyles of customers. 
Foreign language 
As for the specific business portfolios of the surviving company and the spinoff company, these will be finalized at the board within the first half of the year. Foreign language 
Let me now address your question regarding the subscription. Foreign language 
We have been accumulating, uh, knowhow and expertise in the subscription market by utilizing our telecommunication services. 
We believe M&O is, um, very competitive in providing subscription services. 
Foreign 
language 
In various areas, such as telecommunication, media, and e-commerce, we have accumulated a large amount of data 
and we have the digital infrastructure that can cover product planning all the way to offering. And we also have marketing competitiveness in both online and offline channels. 
Foreign language 
Based on such expertise and capabilities, we believe that we can produce a sizable revenue, 
not only based on SK Telecom customers, but also 50 million Korean people. 
Foreign language 
Currently, we have been expanding the scope of subscription products to media gains delivery and education. 
And we're now in the process of developing product duration and offering based on AI technology in order to offer optimal packages for our customers. Foreign language 
Furthermore, we're going to transform the existing team membership platform into a subscription marketing platform that is 
provided for entire population in Korea in the second half of the year. Foreign language 
The subscription market in Korea was 49 trillion Yuan inside last year, and it is expected to grow to 100 trillion Yuan of market by 2025. 
Foreign language Our target for the subscription products and services is having the number of subscribers reach 35 million, uh, by 2025 and achieve the revenue size of 1.5 trillion Yuan by 2025 
by expanding partnerships and business models. 
I believe that we can take up about 20% of the market share of the subscription market that we can address. Foreign language Thank you. 

The next question will be provided by Mina Choi from Samsung Securities. 
Please go ahead. Foreign language 
Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like to ask two questions. 
Uh, the first question is in April, you made a disclosure that you will carry out the spinoff. 
And you mentioned that decisions related to the spinoff will be made in the first half of this year. Can you share with us the upcoming schedule regarding the spinoff? 
The second question is related to the Tina mobility. Recently, you received financial investments and I believe that 
Tina Mobility will start to accelerate its growth trajectory. 
So what is the current status of TM mobility? 
And as for UTI, which was launched in collaboration with Uber, can you provide us with some specific growth strategies on this recently launched business? Foreign language 
Thank you very much for these questions. Uh… Foreign language 
I'm going to answer your question regarding the schedule for the spinoff and, uh, inaudible will answer questions related to the TNEB Mobility. 
Uh, 
Foreign 
langauge 
Currently, we are reviewing the overall process regarding the spinoff, and we aim to table the spinoff plan to the board of directors within the first half of the year. 
In consideration of the board resolution process and the overall process for the spinoff and re-listing, 
we believe that the re-listing can be completed within November after the general shareholders meeting in October. Foreign language 
I am inaudible Head of Corporate Center Two. I'd like to address your question related to the status of business of TNEB Mobility after the, the spinoff. Foreign 
language. Mobility on demand. Mobility as a service. 
Foreign language 
After officially launched in December last year, TNEB Mobility is carrying out business in the four key areas, including the TNEB life platform, 
TNEB auto, mobility on demand, and mobility as a service. 
Foreign language 
In the first quarter of the year, we, uh, built a foundation for TNEB Mobility by receiving 400 billion Yuan of financial investments 
from financial investors. 
And we have launched UTI in collaboration with Uber in order to offer differentiated services centered around taxis. 
Foreign language 

In the second quarter, we plan to introduce a completely new type of subscription membership services in the business area of TNEB Life platform. 
And we also plan to launch a driver on demand service as a pilot for B2C customers. 
Foreign language 
These new services on the four core business areas will be launched as scheduled, which are expected to provide differentiated customer experience. Foreign language 
Now I'd like to discuss the future strategy in the upcoming schedules for UTI. Foreign language 
On April 1st, UTI was officially launched based the joint investment of Uber and TNEB Mobility. 
Foreign language 
In the 

second half of the year, UTI plans to launch a new service by combining Uber taxi and TNEB 
taxi. Initially services will center around contracted taxi drivers and premium taxi services, but going forward, we plan to offer various mobile services 
and additional value 
added services. Based on the taxi platform. 
Foreign language 
As a result, customers will be able to have more options in terms of taxi rides depending on the brands, price plans, and services. 
And at the same time, taxi drivers will benefit from these new services by increasing their sales through differentiated services. And by reducing the time to 
drive around customers. Foreign language 
We're not really able to give you any more details today, but we will be sure to communicate them with the market when the services are ready. Foreign language Thank you. Foreign language 
The next question will be provided by crosstalk from Beijing Securities. Please go ahead. 
Foreign 
language 


Thank you for this opportunity. I would like to ask two questions. The first question is related to your dividend policy. 
You mentioned that even though you start the quarterly dividend payout, 
the total amount of dividend payout would not go down. 
I'd like to know, uh, from when your quarterly dividend payout would begin. And what is the overall dividend payout policy for the two companies after the spinoff? 
The second question is related to the, uh, related to your investment plan and business plan for Wave. 
Uh, you mentioned that, uh, by 2025, you are going to receive a 1 trillion Yuan of investment, and you have various plans for Wave 
but this is quite different from what you mentioned, uh, previously, uh, when you're communicating with us regarding Wave plan by 2023. 
So the, the amount of investment and the amount of revenue seems to have declined slightly, but when you are adjusting your target for 2025, 
so can you provide us with some color on what is your overall investment plan for Wave, which you mentioned is going to be around 1 trillion 
Yuan and what is your revenue, uh, plan and schedule for wave going forward? 
Foreign language 
Thank you, you very much for your questions. I'm going to address your question regarding the dividend policy and Mr. Ha from Corporate Center Two will address your question regarding Wave. 
Foreign Language 
Even after the spinoff, we will continue to maintain the shareholder friendly, uh, management principle. Foreign language 
We will make sure that regardless of the spinoff, the surviving company's level of dividend payout will be at least similar to that of last year. Foreign language As 
Korea's number one, fixed-end wireless telecommunications company, 
as the rollout of 5G is accelerating, we believe that our operating income and the cash flow will be sustained going forward. 
As such, we will make sure that we have the shareholder return policy, so that earnings growth will lead to increased shareholder returns, including dividend payout. 
Foreign language 
At the annual general shareholders meeting, we created a basis for quarterly dividend payout 
and after discussions at the board of directors, we will carry out this new dividend policy plan so that we can start paying out the quarterly dividend, uh, by starting from the end of second quarter. 
Foreign language 
The timing for the quarterly payout for the first quarter has already passed, 
but this portion will be combined for the fourth quarter, uh, dividend payout, so that we can maintain the level of dividend payout to our shoulders to be at least same or similar to that of last year. 
Foreign language 
As for the spinoff company, which will become a specialized investment company, we will make sure that their growth potential of the investment portfolio will be recognized. 
And by actively attracting investment and pursuing IPOs we'll then, we'll then make sure that the corporate value of these businesses will be rightly recognizing the market. Foreign language 
As for the dividend policy of the new, uh, company after the spinoff is finalized and after the board of directors is composed, 
we will be able to communicate to the market. More details later. Foreign language 
I am inaudible Head of Corporate Center Two. Let me first comment on the subscriber tar… subscriber target and the revenue target of Wave before 2023. 
Foreign language 

As we increase the original content lineup and the popularity of Penthouse season two, 
um, and as a result of the successful advertising with IU that began at the end of last year, 
Wave was able to enjoy the growth in its paid TV 
sub… paid subscribers by reaching 2 million within last year. And this subscriber growth trend is continuing. 
Foreign 
language As we continue to differentiate Wave services based on content from terrestrial broadcasting stations and original content, 
we believe that we can achieve the initial target of having 5 million paid subscribers and the revenue of 500 billion Yuan by 2023. 
And we believe that we can achieve this earlier than the 
original target. Foreign language 
Let me now comment on the ways we want to secure 1 trillion Yuan of investment for Wave. Foreign langauge 
In March, uh, Wave made an announcement of making an investment in original content, which is worth 1 trillion Yuan, which will be done by 2025. 
Foreign language 
The financial sources 
for these investments will come from 
a variety of sources, including the rights offering of 100 billion Yuan of the SK Telecom, as external investments and reinvestment of profit from content business. Foreign language 
As for raising external investments, we already received 200 billion Yuan of financial investments in 2019. 
And we're now in the process of preparing for the second round of funding. 
As for this, uh, second round, soon as details are prepared, we're going to communicate them with the market. Foreign language Thank you. Foreign language 
The next question will be provided by Sean Lee from Citigroup. Please go ahead. 
Foreig language 


Thank you for this opportunity. I would like to ask two questions. The first question is related to your security business. 
Uh, the ADT caps and SK InfoSec, who are merged in the first quarter. 
So what's the current status and the operation of this merged entity? And what kinds of synergy are you expecting from this merger? 
The second question is related to your M&O business. 
Um, what is your 5G subscriber target by the end of this year? 
I understand that your initial target by the end of this year was 9 million, but there was a very big net add in the first quarter, so I'm asking this question. There was a very big net adds in the first quarter, so I'm asking this question. Foreign Language 
Thank you very much for your question. Foreign Language 
I will address your question related to the 5G subscriber group trend, and Mr. Ha from corporate center, too, will answer your question related to the security business. 
Foreign Language 

As we have made continued efforts to offer new 5G products and improve the service quality of 5G services, 
and as we were improving the 5G ecosystem with new flagship, uh, handset launches, 
we were able to achieve the 5 sub- 5G subscriber number to 6.74 million by the end of, uh, this quarter, 
compared to last year. So there was a net add of 1.26 million, compared to the end of last year. Foreign Language 
At the beginning of the year, we mentioned that our 5G subscriber target for this year was 9 million. But considering the current trend, we think that we can achieve even 10 million. Foreign Language 
The new tariffs scheme for 5G and ontech price plans that SK Telecom has recently offered to satisfy various customer needs 
are expected to provide customers with more choices and reasonable prices, thereby accelerating 5G migration. 
Foreign Language 
Let me now respond to your question regarding the synergy of ADT Caps tests and Info 
K, SK Infosec. Foreign Language 
We successfully completed the process of merging ADT Caps and SK infosec in March. 
As a result, we have the merged ADT Caps with the revenue size of ¥1.3 trillion, and inaudible 
of ¥357 billion. Foreign 
Language 
Now various activities are underway in earnest in order to maximizing inaudible from these two entities based on our infrastructure for security and various capabilities. 
We expect the annual revenue for 21 to be ¥1.6 trillion. Foreign Language 
In addition, in order to become a global cloud security, um, 
provider, we have signed an agreement to pursue strategic cooperation with Amazon AWS in April. 
Foreign Language 
I can discuss the effects of synergy from the customer perspective and product perspective. 
Foreign Language 

First of all, customer perspective SK Infosec has a large volume of B2B customers, including large enterprises, 
and ADT Caps has B2C customers, including small and medium enterprises, and single, um, single businesses. 
And by inaudible different customer segments, we can create cross selling opportunities. Foreign Language 
From the product perspective, we are expected to provide a customized one stop services that combines secu- 
physical security, information security, and building management as combined solutions. 
Foreign Language 

For instance, if… When there is a cyber intrusion or detection of mal- uh, malicious codes, we can do video analysis by utilizing the platform data, 
and by leveraging on our access control system. We can detect any intruders to buildings and assets, 
and such flexible response will become more comfortable. Foreign Language Thank you. Foreign Language Foreign Language Foreign Language Foreign Language 
The next question will be provided Neil Anderson from HSBC, please go ahead. 
Thank you very much, and good afternoon. 
Just have one question please. And it relates to the media business. And the sequential improvement in operating margins in the first quarter. 
So for the, the three quarters last year, it's around 6.7%, and it's increased to 7.8% in the first quarter. 
So my question is, how sustainable is that, and, and what are your margins target for this year? Thank you. 
Foreign Language Foreign Language Um, Neil Anderson, thank you very much for your question. Foreign Language We, uh, believe that there are various factors that have contributed to improvement in the operating margin of SK broad 
band. 
Foreign Language 
So these various factors include the effect of the t-broad merger, 
uh, that's the first factor. The second factor is the increase in the subscriber base, and increasing the commission income from home shopping, broadcasting. 
The, the third factor is the continued increase in the IPTV subscriber base. And the final factor would be effective CapEx implementation and cost efficiency. Foreign Language 
Going forward, we will continue to make efforts to increase the subscriber base and, uh, carry out our business in a more efficient manner so that we can maintain and increase profitability of the media business. Thank you. Foreign Language 
The next question will be provided by Stan Liang from JP Morgan, please go ahead. 
Foreign 
Language 
Thank 
you for this 
opportunity 
to ask questions. 
The first question is related to your dividend policy. You mentioned that detailed decisions regarding the payout of the dividend policy for the spin off company will be made soon. 
But can I safely assume that given the MNO dividend payout level of one, uh… level of 10,001 per share 
and in assu- in assuming that there will be dividend payout from the new spin off 
company, can we anticipate that the total amount of dividend payout from SK Telecom will be paid going forward? 
The second question is related to your subscription business model. 
There are high expectations for subscription services, 
and I like to know if your subscription model will be to push several subscription models and services separately, or to follow the model of Amazon where you have one single subscription 
platform where multiple services are provided. 
And if you continue to launch these new subscription services, are they going to be linked with your MNO telecom subscribers? Or are they going to be operated separately? 
Foreign Language 
Thank you very much for your questions. I am going to respond to your question on the dividend policy and Hun Yung Jean, Head of Subscription Service Company will answer the second question. 
Foreign 
Language As for the first question on our dividend policy, your understanding is correct. 
The dividend payout from the MNO business as part of the surviving company will be similar or more than the previous level of dividend payout. 
And on top of that, e- we have not yet decided on the dividend policy of the spin off company. But if they start to pay out dividend, it's going to be a plus alpha. Foreign Language 
As I mentioned earlier, when the board of directors is composed for the spin off company, and when discussions on the dividend policy are made, we're going to communicate them with the market. Foreign Language 
I am Hu- I am Hun Yung Jean. I am the heard of the subscription, um, business, and let me address your second question. 
Foreign Language. 
As you may understand, we have many family, uh, businesses under the ICT umbrella. And there are many different services and products that we're preparing 
that will help, uh, enhance the likelihood of customers. Foreign Language Basically, 
I can say that our model will be similar to amazon prime where there will be an integrated subscription, uh, paradigm. 
In addition to that, we are planning to offer additional services and products for subscription. 
Foreign Language So we're planning to charge a monthly, uh, subscription fee for the subscription customers. 
Foreign Language As for, uh, your question with regarding the connection with MMO, um, 
MMO services, we are currently planning this subscription platform to ta- to reach out to 50 million Korean population. 
So we're currently not considering any linkage between the subscription services and the MNO feed. Foreign Language Thank you. 
Foreign Language We will now like to close our conference call for the first quarter of 2021. Thank you.
