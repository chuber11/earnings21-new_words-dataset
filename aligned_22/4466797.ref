Hello and welcome to the nine months 21 EDPR results call. My name is Courtney, and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. 
Please note that this call is being recorded and for the duration of the call, your lines will be on listen only. 
However, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. 
This can be done by pressing star one on your telephone keypad to register your question. 
If you require assistance anytime, please press star zero, and you will be connected to an operator. 
And I will now hand you over to your host, Andre Fernandez, 
head in investor relations, planning, and control and sustainability to begin today's conference. Thank you. 
Good afternoon, everyone. Uh, thank you very much for attending EDPR's third quarter 2021 results conference call. 
We've, we have here with us, our CEO, Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade and our CFO, Rui Teixeira 
who will run you through the key highlights and inaudible of the business plan execution and of the, the nine month results. 
We'll then move into Q&A in which we will be taking your questions. 
This call is expected to last a- around one hour, um, and I'll now give the floor to our CEO, Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade. 
Thank you, Andre. Good afternoon, everyone. 
I hope you're all doing well. And it's also a pleasure to be on these calls, um, and be able to not only present what, what we've been doing, but also take your questions afterwards. 
So anyway, today we have a lot to talk about, 
so I'll get straight into the presentation. We move to slide five, in just giving you a broad overview of the, the business plan execution. 
First of all, in the, the key pillars of growth, we are ramping up and we have around 2.5 gigawatts added year on year. 
So, this is a good progress towards the three gigawatts plus, uh, which we were aiming for in the 2021-2023 growth targets. 
So, this is actually the largest number of megawatts ever built by EDP Renewables in 12 months. 
And I'd really like to highlight that this shows that there is a successful ramp up of the growth rate, and it should give us confidence on the execution of the growth plan. 
Also today, uh, we just announced the acquisition of Sunseap. You would have seen that news, I'm sure this morning. 
I think it establishes a great platform in Asia Pacific. 
This is a region, and I'll talk a little bit about this later on, but it's a huge gross potential in the region. Um, so that's something I think that's worth also highlighting, obviously. 
On secure capacity, 
we now have 8.1 gigawatts secured out of which 7.9 gigawatts in 2021 to 2023. 
So, that's around 75% of our 2021 -' 23 target. 
I think, good progress there. 
And we also have visibility on additional 4.1 gigawatts of PPAs in our key markets 
in which we are either shortlisted or currently under negotiation. So, uh, we will hopefully be giving good visibility on the rollout of those PPAs also in the next couple of months. 
So, overall solid ramp up of growth, a good platform for growth in Asia Pacific and also strong execution with short term visibility on the, uh, additional PPAs. 
On the asset rotation program, so the, the pillar here in the, the middle, 
we continue to see strong market appetite and attractive valuations. Um, both for wind and solar. 
We have the 2.3 billion of asset rotation proceeds, multiples continue to be very attractive on average 1.6 million euros per megawatt. 
1.7 for wind, and 1.2 for solar. 
So I'll go there in a little bit more detail in, in a minute. 
As of September, we have 550 million of asset rotation proceeds, overall capital gains of 151 million following the, the Mayflower earn out of 30 million. 
So, overall we're on tracks to deliver capital gains above the 300 million euros of guidance that we've given for this year. 
And we have a couple of transactions, which we've already announced, but which we're hoping to close over the next couple of weeks or months. Um, but hopefully at least one or two by the end of the year. 
On excellence, which is a third pillar, so for the, uh, the nine months, um, to date, um, EDP Renewals has achieved 28% load factor. 
This is a down 0.6%, uh, year on year, 
but it still reflects 95% of the expected gross capacity factor. 
We have had a bad year in terms of wind, I mean, low resource, particularly in the US and Spain. And I think that's something that we've talked about in previous quarters and the third quarter was, um, no exception. 
Regarding operations, we continue with a strong performance with core OPEX per megawatt decreasing 3% year on year. 
And on the technical side, we continue to deliver a good availability of 97%. So, slightly above year on year. So, in terms of operations, I think good performance there. 
On ESG, execution is well on track for the business plan targets. We have already most of the initiatives are already in progress under the changing tomorrow now program. 
And finally, um, I mean, just a, on a note, it's not here on the slide, but 
we have an inaudible 917 million euros, net income of around 150 million, 148 million. 
This is mostly impacted by the lower capital gains year on year. 
The first quarter, one off ERCOT event and lower generation or lower wind in the US and Spain. I think that's, um, something we have to recognize. 
So, it hasn't been a great year from a wind resource perspective, um, and overall the high pool prices in the third quarter has also introduced some pressure on the, the hedges. 
In Spain in particular, the EBITDA is 40-45 million below expectation in the nine months. 30 million of which is from low wind, 
especially in the second and third quarter, which is below, um, the, the P50. 
And then you have around 10 to 15 million from the financial hedges in the third quarter, given the high prices combined with low generation. 
So, I'll go this, go through this in more details and, and who we will, will also elaborate more on this. 
Anyway, let's move forward to slide six. 
So here, um, on the growth platform for Asia Pacific, uh, that we, and the Sunseap transaction we announced today. 
So as you know, we had 20 gigawatts of editions until 2025 set out on the strategic plan. 
1.4 gigawatts, we'd outlined or highlighted will come from new markets. 
These new geographies do bring us optionality. They bring diversification to our portfolio. And so, the expansion into Asia Pacific was something we'd been working on now for a while. So, um, 
I think today's news is, is certainly good news. 
We move to slide seven, uh, just talking a little bit about the overall Asia Pacific market. 
It's one of the largest renewables markets globally. 
It has strong growth expectations, especially in solar. 
We're talking about 120 gigawatts per year, um, in terms of growth. So, it's a massive market. 
And, uh, EDP Renewables, we really felt it was important to tap this opportunity and have a foothold in the- 
Please stand by whilst we reestablish the connection with our speakers. 
Thank you for your patience. <silence> Thank you for your patience. Please stand by whilst we reestablish the connection with your host. 
Thank you for your patience. The connection has been reestablished. Speaker, please continue. 
Okay. So, um, sorry for the technical difficulties. I mean, I, I think this is the first. 
I'm told that we somehow got disconnected around slide seven. So, I'll resume on side seven hopefully you haven't heard of that before. 
Um, so I'll just go back to slide seven and, um, and talk about Asia Pacific. So, this is really one of the largest markets globally. 
Uh, it's got, you know, huge growth expectations, especially in solar 
and, you know, some key numbers, which I think are worth highlighting 120 gigawatts per year market. So, it's, uh, it's really a massive market. 
55% of the global growth and renewables and solar represents 65% of this growth in Asia Pacific. 
Also something which I'm sure everyone will be familiar with, which is, I mean, this is a highly populated, densely populated region. So, it's over four billion people with, and over 50% of the global power demand. 
And finally, just to say that countries like China, Japan, South Korea, they've all committed to net zero emissions by 2050 or 2060. 
And so, there does seem to also be a, a general trend towards de-carbonization in the region and promoting renewals. 
And so, just a final our message on this slide, 
if we are serious about reaching net zero by 2050, and there is a broad consensus around this, then all regions and all countries will need to contribute to this target. 
And so, we want to make sure that EDP Renewables is positioned in the long run to take advantage of this opportunity. So, I, 
I think I'd just like to highlight this in relation to, in relation to this region, which, um, which is obviously I think key to making us global. 
And that's exactly the, the topic of the next side. So, slide eight. With this platform, we now become truly global. 
So, we already had a very strong platform in the US. A very strong platform in Europe. We have a good platform in Latin America with Brazil, Chile, Colombia. 
And now we set up this platform also in Asia Pacific. 
Uh, so we think that Sunseap's team is very complimentary to EDPR both geographically and technologically. 
Um, you know, the, their footprint solar pipeline together with our scale and our capabilities. The fact that we have, for example, wind that we can also bring to the table. 
That means that we believe we will be able to build out the platform and accelerate the growth in the region. 
So, now havingâ€¦ Once we complete the acquisition, we'll be present in 25 markets representing 75% of global growth over the next decade. 
So, that's, you know, we'll have a very strong representation in all the key markets. 
Moving to slide nine and a, a specific comment on Sunseap. 
So, it is a solar focused platform. It is based out of Singapore. Present in nine markets. Uh, 550 megawatts of operating in under construction assets. 
Most of these in Singapore with a very low risk profile, as you know, Singapore is a AAA rating. 
Sunseap is also present in Vietnam where EDPR has also, um, is also present. So, we'll be able to integrate our positions there. 
Very young assets below two years. 20 year contracted revenues. So, 76% of that PPAs and, and 24% regulated 
at an average price of 75 euros per MWh. So, 
low risk, stable, long-term cash flows, completely aligned with the EDPR strategy. 
Also, they bring very strong client relationships and a track 
record. Uh, the off takers include some of the EDPR clients in Europe and in the US. So, companies like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple. 
So, so solar distributed generation represents around 70% of the operating and under construction portfolio. 
And it's a key technology obviously to grow in Asia Pacific, going for utility scale will also play a key and increasingly relevant role. 
So, Sunseap brings a strong footprint in Asia Pacific, a great track record over 10 years of success- successfully developing the business there. 
Got a, a fantastic management team, uh, with a lot of local knowledge. Over 400 employees and growing, uh, given the growth of the market. 
So, that we'll facilitate the local culture know how and also the long term, uh, buildup of relationships. 
So, I think they have a great reputation in the region. And then I think that gives us a lot of confidence to leverage on that and accelerate growth. 
Also, very importantly, and, and moving to slide 10, Sunseap has a, a great pipeline. 
So, overall the portfolio is around 5.5 gigawatts. So, on top of the 550 megawatts of operating under the construction, 
there are 130 megawatts of contracted capacity. So, almost 700 megawatts of secured capacity. 
And we have a pipeline of almost five gigawatts in different stages of development. So, around two gigawatts of advanced stage and 2.8 gigawatts of early stage. 
Future growth will have more, obviously more geographic diversification and also higher exposure to solar utility, uh, scale going forward. 
Moving on to slide 11, I'm talking just a little bit about valuations and, um, and stakes. 
So, we are leveraging our capabilities to really accelerate the growth and the value creation in Asia Pacific through Sunseap. 
The way we see it, it's putting the business on steroids and really leveraging it up. 
Uh, we will have a 87% stake, this may actually increase to around 91%. 
Um, Sunseap has a, as I mentioned, a great management team so, the, the founders will stay invested with, um, around, 
uh, six and a half percent and with their incentives fully aligned with the growth and the profitability of the business. 
So, I think this is the key point to make sure that we have a smooth transition 
and we really bring the local experience and the, the new culture to EDPR 
with, uh, obviously they have a great knowledge of the markets and, and the development in the Asia Pacific markets. And so, we want to make sure that, um, you know, that we are able to merge the companies as well and, and really leverage on Sunseap to, to take it even further and make it grow even faster. 
Together with, um, the founders and the management, um, we, we will have around 94% that may actually increase to 98%. The impl- 
In terms of valuation, so the implied price, uh, where, where we are paying is around 870 million euros. 
Breaking this down, I'd say that there's one block, which is CapEx. So, implicit in that 550 megawatts. 
Since it's mostly solar distributed generation, it has an average CapEx per megawatt, AC, 
okay. So, this is important to stress. This is AC not DC of around 1 million euros. 
We have the value creation associated with the operating and the construction assets together with the secure capacity. Um, so a total of 700 megawatts, 
and I'm sure you can come up with an NPV per megawatt reference for this bucket. 
I just re-emphasize size that these assets are very young. They have 20 year contracted revenues at an average price of 75 euros per MWh. 
And finally, there's a pipeline and the platform, and we believe we'll be creating significant value from the existing pipeline. 
And we'll be able to leverage the, the Sunseap model. So, with strong development capabilities in this footprint in nine markets to, to really deliver the growth going forward. 
Overall for GDPR, it really opens up a new region of the world 
where we didn't have a significant presence. And we think that this together, in terms of solar, together with what we can bring in, wind 
will really mean that we can ramp up this platform, um, as I said in the, in the Asia as Pacific region. 
Okay. So that's, uh, Sunseap. I'd just like to now talk you through some of the other, um, key metrics for the business. 
If we move to slide 12, uh, we have around eight gigawatts secured, 8.1 gigawatts secured. Uh, so it's up 2.7 gigawatts year to date. 
Um, and I think that the, the origination capabilities and, and also the com- competitive projects that we're able to bring. 
If we zoom in just on 2021 to ' 23, as I mentioned earlier, we'll have around 7.9 gigawatts 
secured already until ' 23. So, that's around 75%. 
We continue to have the disciplined investment approach. And, and so, I think attractive returns, low risk profile, contracted NPV of around 60%. 
So, we continue to see those metrics, uh, across the different projects that we are investing in. 
And so, overall strong visibility on the 2021 to ' 23, um, timeframe and also solid risk return profile. 
We move to slide 13, and this is something we've talked about previously, but just to give you an update on this. 
So, we continue to be protected from CapEx cost inflation, as we've discussed in previous calls and we have limited exposure on 10% of our secured capacity. 
For new projects, we are seeing the PPA market and the auctions adjusting to the sector wide increasing CapEx. 
So, from that perspective, it's not hindering our competitiveness when bidding for new projects and the return thresholds are being preserved. 
So, just to give you a specific example for example, if look at the Spanish auction, uh, now in October, you'll have seen that the average price of the auction went up, 
um, that has to do, we believe, with the adjustment also to the, the new CapEx expectations. 
We are also seeing that when we are doing bilateral, 
um, let's say discussions on PPAs, 
where we are seeing those, um, prices feeding through into new PPA prices, revised PPA prices under discussion, and, and being accepted by clients. 
In relation to the supply chain, we have a strong position. We have a, a privileged relationship I'd say with the suppliers. 
And so we continue to monitor and to manage any disruptions that might happen to the supply chain. 
In relation to winds, we feel comfortable. There doesn't seem to be any, uh, material issue with our project in the short and the medium term. 
In solar, something we're monitoring more closely, um, obviously to make sure that, uh, any disruptions are dealt with quickly and that we can manage that in the context of our development and construction. 
If we move to slide 14, in terms of pipeline, we continue to ramp up. Uh, we have good short term visibility on growth. 
I wanted to highlight that 60% of the current secured capacity has been secu- secured through PPAs. So, that's a market where we continue to be very active 
and we actually expect it to increase even more of the coming years. 
So, as I mentioned earlier, 4.1 gigawatts of PPA is under negotiation and shortlisted, uh, which we hope will provide short term visibility on additional capacity. 
Slide 15 on offshore, onshore winds continues to grow. So, operating capacity is now 1.5 gigawatts in 2022. Expected to reach 3.4 gigawatts by 2025. 
Uh, more east finalized construction, I had the, the pleasure of being up in Scotland 
a couple of weeks ago to, uh, just inaugurate the O&M center in Fraserburgh. 
Um, we're moving ahead also with some other project in, in Scotland. So, the more west, uh, we're also expected to give visibility on that soon. 
We have several other projects that we are continuing to develop. Well, Poland, US, South Korea. 
We are, we are participating in the RFP in Massachusetts for Mayflower. Hopefully we'll have visibility on that soon. 
And also in relation to Scotland, we'll also have visibility on that soon. So, we have a, a good strong presence in Scotland. 
So, let's, um, let's wait and see what comes out of that auction. 
Slide 16, 
just a quick comment here on asset rotation, Iâ€¦ Slide 16, just a quick comment here on asset rotation, you will have seen most of these numbers. So just very quickly, 2.3 billion of proceeds, 30% of the 8 billion target such as the full five year plan. 
We're overall very happy with the multiples achieved in the, in the execution. 
Um, within the third quarter, we up sized the U.S. transaction to 80% and, we also signed the Polish transaction. 
So, clearly we are on track to deliver capital gains north of 300 million in 2021. 
The actual value will depend on the timing of the regulatory approvals and the closing of each transaction. 
So all in all execution on the asset rotation going well, 
we continue to see strong appetite from investors. 
And so now our efforts are totally on the regulatory approval side to make sure that we can get at least some of these over the, the line here. Um, by the end of 2021. 
Slide 17, a quick note on ESG. So, circular economy by diversity. 
We have been promoting, um, a lot the, the waste recovery and the operational phase for a while. So, extending our best practices now to the rest of the value chain. 
Re powering, although it's still not very material 
EDPR is focused on tackling the re powering wave that we expect post 2025, especially in Spain, Portugal and the U.S. 
So far, we've done, we've re powered two wind farms in Spain, and we are re powering another one in the U.S. 
In the two sites that we re powered in Spain. More, most of the, let's say the waste generated was recovered. So almost 95% 
in this respect, we are participating also in some blade recycling projects in Spain, the U.S. and also in Portugal and, um, you know, 
100% of the area impacted during the re powering processes in Spain were fully restored. 
In relation to communities, 
we are obviously want to make sure that we work with the local communities so that we are able to, uh, keep the alignment with our core business and make sure that the, you know, we are able to develop our projects 
in harmony with the, the local communities. 
In terms of people, 
um, we are aiming to achieve 36%, uh, female employees. 
Currently we're at 32%, but 37% of our new hires are all women, which I think contributes well to achieving our goal. 
So, definitely looking out for equality of opportunities there. 
And lastly, just in relation to the sustainable suppliers goal, 
um, we, what we've been asking our core business suppliers, um, is basically in terms of health and safety, environmental ethical criteria to be totally aligned with us. 
So it's not just a question of EDPR having certain goals and targets. It's also making sure that that extends to, to our suppliers, we, our key suppliers 
and with this business plan, as you, we have the idea of going one step further by making sure that, um, we have these ESG goals totally aligned with the suppliers. 
So I'll stop here and I'll turn it over to inaudible to walk you through the, the nine month results and then come back again for closing remarks. 
Thank you. Thank you, Miguel. Good afternoon to you all. Well, so let's move on to the, uh, nine month result. 
Um, so on slide 19, 
our financial performance, um, your year has been as you know, mostly impacted by in one hand, lower capital gains. 
The one off aircraft event in, in Q1. Um, and also the lower generation that we have been observing in U.S. and Spain. 
So we achieved the 917 million Euro inaudible and 148 million Euros net profit in this first nine months. 
Uh, that's on the back of the generating 21 point terra watt hours of clean energy that's of 5%. 
So that's 122 million at the net profit. 
So on top of the hundred million, uh, gain on the US asset rotation, 
we have also some positive price adjustments from 2020 transactions, uh, in offshore and in this rosewater build and transfer project. 
Um, along with 30 million Euros are not from Mayflower. 
Below Evita, we continue to improve our average cost of debt 
3.4% versus 3.5%. So that's, uh, reduction of about 0.2% points year and year. 
Um, in US, our top line, uh, is impacted by the Q1 one of cut event. Uh, you know, we extensively discussed this, uh, in, in the first quarter. 
Um, but also by the fact that we are below the average resource. 
Uh, for the period, we also have a weak wind resource, um, in Spain as well. 
And let me just, you know, highlight here, um, some impact that we have in Spain. Uh, that of course are, uh, hitting us, uh, in the nine month result. 
So, overall Spain is about 40 to five, 45 million euros below our expectation for the nine month thousand 
21. Um, uh, out of these three are around 30 million are from low winds, and that's particularly in the Q2 and Q3, uh, where we have, you know, we are below the 90% of our P 
50. Um, and about 10 to 15 million euros from financial hedges in Q2, uh, Q3 given the high prices and, and the low generation. 
Um, just to give you an expect, expected full year result from this impact, uh, with the P 50 in terms of wind for the fourth quarter is around 25 million euros. 
So, I think it's also worth highlighting that, um, given pull only what above the 60 US per micro hour in July. 
The, the regulatory adjustment that is booked in the Q3 concentrates, uh, the regulatory adjustment for the full nine month, 2021. 
So, there is a concentration 
to technicality, but there's a concentration here in the Q3. 
So just, you know, as snap shotting the balance sheet, NetApp decrease year to date to three point 32 billion Euro, 
this is of course on the back of the 1.5 billion capital increase 
around 240 million asset rotation. Uh, so the equity proceeds from that, 
uh, and around 0.6 billion of the tax equity, uh, tax equity, um, which is already booked for the US project. And, of course, it impacts the, the net that, uh, reduction. Um, 
I think it's important now that if we move to the operational side, so we can move to slide 20. 
Um, highlighting that, you know, we added 2.5 gigs of wind and solar capacity. Uh, year on year. 
This is the highest capacity ever installed by EDPR in a 12 months period. 
I think it is demonstrating that how we are ramping up the business and the growth rate. Um, in addition to that, we have 2.7 gigs, which are under construction. 
So I think this, in a bizarre, nervous that, you know, speak from themselves in terms of the ramping up of the growth profile at TDPR. 
Year in year, we successfully completed one gigawatt net of asset rotation deals that's in Spain and in the US. 
Um, so we end the period with a 13 giga, uh, portfolio, uh, by the end of September 2021. 
Uh, and it really balanced mix across the main platforms. So, in North America 55% Europe around 40%, 
uh, and the rest of the world, uh, 
Brazil 5% and, you know, just still a minority position in the rest of the world here, just considering Vietnam. 
So, not yet incorporating the acquisition, uh, that Miguel referred to, uh, sincerely being in, in, in the APAC. 
Um, our load factor achieved 28%. Um, in this nine months. It is a recovery, uh, in Nigeria and Brazil. 
Naturally, this is offset by the one author cart event. Um, and, um, across this period, a little resource in US. 
Technical availability, uh, at good levels, 97%, that's slightly above, uh, the, the, this, uh, this number for the, for last year. 
Um, electricity output increased 5% year on year. So, this of course benefits from the capacity additions. Uh, naturally this is offset by the lower resource. 
So we generate 21.5 Terra watt hours of clean energy. So we, we can say that we have avoided 13 million tons of, uh, CO2 emissions. 
Um, operations in North America, Europe and Brazil generated respectively around 58% to 37% and 6% of the total input. 
On page 21 in looking into the revenues. 
And we have, uh, a reduction. Uh, this will be last year. So, the 5% reduction. Of course, this is 
due to sell inaudible. So, if you were or not to see this on a like for like basis, we would be plus 2% versus nine months other than 
20. Um, but also driven by the lower average price, um, around 51 Euros per micro hour. 
Um, in some unfavorable effects, uh, which as I said, you know, as I said before, it's also partly upset by sending capacity. 
In Europe, the average price decreased 10% to 74 Euros. 
Uh, that's of course, you're into 
Spain. Uh, the asset meets not only the asset meets from the following 20 asset rotation deal. But, also the impact of the regulatory and financial hedges, uh, in the context of very high pool prices. 
Um, in Portugal, the tariff extension and the new additions, 
um, and, you know, in the rest of Europe, we actually observed an 11% increase in terms of the average, uh, uh, revenue price, or price increase, 
uh, that of course, offset these reductions in Spain and in Portugal. 
In North America, the, the average price increased by 1%, uh, with higher merchant prices. Um, that's offset by that were offset by the sell down in Q1 
.In Brazil, average price was up by 9%. Uh, 239 real Brazil in reals. 
Um, and this, of course, back on the fact that we have, uh, were exposed to higher merchant prices. 
Um, uh, and also, you know, the evolution in terms of capacity. 
Revenue is totaled 1.3 billion with impact from the sell down. So, that's a reduction of 92 million year on year, 
uh, lower average prices. Um, so that's minus 27 million year on year, if we exclude sell down. 
Um, and some for X translation, as I mentioned in beginning, uh, and others that account for about 54 million, uh, reduction versus last year. 
Uh, which of course they are not upset by the capacity editions that contributes to around 180 million year on year. 
So like for, like I said before, if you are to adjust by the, for the sell downs, we would have an increased revenues in EDPR by 2% year on year. 
Uh, on the OPEX moving to the next slide naturally, you know, we keep a very, you know, focus, uh, you know, in terms of excellence of the operations. 
So, core OPEX per average, in megawatt, uh, is up only by 1% year on year. Uh, so actually this is a minus 3% if adjusted 
on the back of, uh, uh, our O and M strategy. And of course, as you know, we have been from uploading the, the company in terms of resources to meet the, uh, the business plan growth. 
Um, overall, you know, this uh, leads us to have in a bit of, of our, of 917 million euros. 
Of course, this is driven not only by the top line performance, uh, lower capital gains year on year. 
Um, in terms of the geographical mix, 
you know, pretty much at 50 50, um, contribution, uh, from North America and Europe, uh, to EDPR results as on a consolidated basis. 
Um, on the net profit, we ended up the period with 148 million euros, um, again on the back of the, the top line, uh, performance. 
The financial, um, have improved, uh, on the financials. As I said, in beginning, we have improved our cost of debt, 
uh, to 3.4%. So, that's a reduction, uh, 0.2% points versus last year. 
Um, again, I would like to emphasize that on, uh, uh, the PNL tax as a negative impact to the year in year. 
But, the bulk of this is non-cash, uh, and cash taxes are neutral uh, what as, as when you compare to the nine month result, uh, 2020. 
So on the next slide, in terms of that, uh, NetApp and tax equity increased 191 million Euros. 
Um, of course, you know, the asset rotation proceeds and, and capital increase, they are, they have offset or funded the, the growth acceleration. 
Um, so the, by September, we actually have that approximately a hundred million lower, uh, versus the 31st of December, uh, uh, last year. 
Um, and, uh, almost 90% of the 3.3 billion NetApp is at the fixed interest rate. 
Uh, so it's, as you know, it's part of our, uh, risk profile. 
Tax equity increased 1.4 billion, uh, naturally following the 0.6 billion of tax equity proceeds that we announced, um, recently, 
uh, but also offset by the re consolidation of the tax equity associated with the US as, as a rotation deal, um, in June. 
Um, and just also to, to finalize the focusing on the period, um, ESG, um, on this slide 25. So starting by the environmental performance, 
um, as I said before, we avoided 13 million tons of CO2 emissions. 
So we are effectively contributing to this global ch challenge of reaching a, a net zero. 
Um, the company's emissions represent only about 0.2% of the avoided ones. 
Um, in terms of circularity, we, we are maintaining our recovery ratios aligned with previous years continuously working naturally to, to improve on those. 
In biodiversity, no significant spills, no significant fires. 
Uh, we have, uh, 60, uh, sorry, 56 near misses, uh, and year and year. I mean, the variation is pretty much aligned with the company growth. 
Um, social dimension, uh, as Miguel said, we have surpassed 2000 employees. So that's 23% increase year on year, 
uh, and actually, you know, moving towards our diversity goal, 
um, with the percentage of female employees increasing to 32%. 
Uh, regarding health and safety, 
uh, there was an average of 1.7 work related accidents per million work hours, uh, 
64 lost workdays per million work hours, which is in line year on year. Unfortunately, uh, we have some, 
uh, um, severe accidents to severe accidents, uh, that are impacting naturally, uh, the, the business. And, you know, we can, we have been, 
um, dedicating a significant amount of time to improve the, the safety, health, and safety across the different operations and the construction sites. 
So, learning from these lessons, unfortunately. 
Um, and just a final note regarding communities, uh, EDPR maintained its five million Euros cumulative of investment in access to energy. 
Um, we reached 1.1 million Euros in social investment. 
So that's slightly lower year on year naturally given the COVID 19 response plan that we implemented last year, uh, within our local communities. 
And with this, I would hand back to Miguel for his closing remarks. Thank you. Okay. 
Thank you. So just to finalize the presentation and just a couple of words on the overall environment and also on the outlook for, for renewals. 
First, then if we move to slide 27, we continue to see an environment, a policy environment, if want, which is highly supportive of the energy transition. 
We knew, we have the recent news clip from comp 26, which I'm sure you're following, uh, now taking place in Glasgow. 
And I think it just comes to, to show sort of the need to really elevate the global commitments 
and also different measures that, um, that the various different countries and, and political leaders and companies are taking to fight climate change. 
So clearly this fight for climate change requires strong fundamentals. 
You will have an unprecedented growth in renewables, which I think it's an interesting document. I'm sure you've read highlighted by the international energy agencies, 
world energy outlook, which was just recently re uh, uh, released now in mid-October 
and state set to limit global warming warming to one and a half degrees would require an annual global clean energy investment to four trillion by 2030. 
So, four times as much as the one trillion, which was invested in 2020. 
I mean, these are absolutely staggering, uh, values. And I mean, even a fraction of this would be a significant increase versus what we are seeing today. 
And I believe there is obviously a political rule by a lot of different countries to move, move in that direction. 
In Europe, in particular, which has been a champion of climate change, the European commission's toolbox 
to tackle the increase in energy cost which has been obviously a big issue on the agenda recently 
is very much to reinforce the need to deploy renewables. 
Um, clearly we need to also have energy efficiency solutions. We need to continue to build out grid across the continent. 
Um, there will be the need to deploy 750 billion euros from the European next generation funds. 
So, and that's a process we expect will now be moving to the stage of application of projects at the national level. 
And hopefully we'll have more visibility in during 2022, but 
I mean, bottom line is the European commission has been very, um, aggressive and I think very consistent in its fight for climate change in supporting the need for deploying renewables and, 
uh, electrifying economy and so forth. 
In relation to the US, I mean, clearly I'm sure we've all been watching closely, 
the build back better framework package, 
which has been in discussion. So as you know, there was already one package had been approved, the infrastructure bill, which was, let's say there were tying it to, to the second package as well. 
Um, we, it's currently estimated at around 1.8 trillion, uh, that builds back better bill. 
It includes the long term visibility of the fiscal incentives for clean energy investments. So the, the PTCs and the ITCs potentially extending those. 
Um, and it gives a tax credit total amount of 320 billion dollars to support the renewables in the medium term. 
So clearly the US, it seems to be taking some good steps, 
hopefully in the very, very short term. The next couple of days is only, hopefully no more than a couple weeks. There will be, um, visibility on, on closing that. 
And, uh, as you know, it's been something which has been around for a while, but, uh, it seems that people are quite optimistic about this. 
In terms of key takeaways. So slide 28 and then just before moving on to Q and A. 
So first, we really are going global now. I mean, we were already a global com company, but now present in 25 markets, 
which exposes the company to 75% of worldwide growth in renewables until 2030. 
So I think this is, uh, very significant step that we're taking 
this growth platform in Asia Pacific. Um, basically we will leverage on Sunteep. 
So, as I say, an established platform fully consistent with our portfolio, 
it's got a low risk long term contracted profile, which is very similar to, or something that we like, uh, very much. 
EDP renewables, ramping up the growth two and a half gigawatts added year, year on year, 
2.7 gig under construction. So getting closer to the three gigs, um, to target per per year. 
And, we now have the over eight gigawatts secured with good returns and risk profile. And so that's a 75% of the target until 2023. 
As a rotation, I've talked about very solid and good 
financials have been impacted in this third quarter or the, the nine months to date by the lower capital gains year on year, 
lower generation in US and Spain. 
But, we believe that the attractive asset rotation deals that we've done, uh, will allow us to, uh, to close the gap, uh, over the next couple of months. 
So, I think there is a need to look through the short term 
pressure, um, and really think about, let's say the underlying potential and growth, uh, of VDP renewals, which is absolutely fantastic. 
So the growth outlook continues to be very strong. We see it very strongly. EDP renewals is extremely well positioned to capture it globally now in all of the different platforms. 
And so I just really like to reiterate, I mean, on behalf of the team, 
clearly very enthusiastic about the growth prospect for the business in the different regions. And now looking forward to also tackle the growth opportunity in Asia Pacific. 
So, clearly focus on the US and Europe, Latin America, and now this additional, um, region. 
So, focused on the plan, focused on delivering the megawatts and the, the numbers. And, um, now happy to turn it over to Q 
and A, 
so inaudible Thank you, Miguel, crosstalk So, we can move now to Q and A 
Thank you as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question on today's call, so please press star one on your telephone keypad, 
please ensure your line is unmuted locally, and you will be advised when to ask your question. 
If you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question, please press star two. 
So, as a reminder, that will star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to ask a question. 
And our first question comes in from the line of Alberto Gandolphy calling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for, for taking my questions. 
Uh, the first one is to go back a little bit on slide, uh, 13. 
Um, you basically said that, um, you are insulated from any cost inflation. So, I just wanted to confirm, 
um, can you maybe again, specify from on a time horizon basis, 
you know, do you think you are protected on concentration until the beginning of 2023 Q1 Q2 and of 22? 
You can give us some ideas and any disruption from the supply chain you are seeing. 
Shipping, freight, any delays that might derive from, from that? 
Um, on second question is on the M and A transaction you announced 
today. May I just ask, um, in terms of financing, you believe that the balance sheet, uh, 
is 
okay, you believe that just asset rotations would be sufficient, uh, or any other ways of financing we should be thinking, thinking about here. 
Um, and the last question a bit provocative, so apologies in advance if it doesn't come out properly, right. 
But you could argue that there isn't much net income that the company is generating for the first nine months of the year. 
So, can I ask you how you explain that? 
Is it because you are really besides the load factor that were well below average, but you can argue that the capital gains you booked offsets losses from taxes. 
So, point would be, is it just because you think you're ramping up capacity, you're putting so much upfront costs 
and then revenues will gradually keep growing with inflation in most jurisdictions. 
Is it an increase in dev X because you or accelerating construction, or 
how should we think about that and evolution of net income in the next 3, 4, 5 years? Thank you so much. 
However, um, so, uh, good questions. In relation to the first question. So the, the cost inflation. 
Yes, I mean, we are insulated in fact for, you know, the project that we have in the, in the short term. 
Uh, we not only have the, in many cases, the actual turbines and the solar panels delivered, and we're sort of the ones that are under construction. 
Um, we have a high degree of confidence and let's say in visibility on that. 
In relation to things which are further out, and I, I believe you mentioned sort of 2023, 
I mean, in those cases, what we're doing to the extent that we haven't yet closed those projects, 
we will be, uh, feeding that through into the the PPAs, as I mentioned, in terms of the the cost inflation. 
Um, in terms of wind turbines, we also have 
good visibility. We have no indication to the contrary that, that would, you know, we would not be able to get access to, to the turbines that have been contracted. 
Um, and so that's something which, you know, even recently we're talking to the teams, 
I think we have privileged relationship with the different. The teams, I think we have privileged relationship with the different suppliers. 
And so that's something, again, that's, 
you know, we don't expect any, certainly not any material, nothing that would be, um, sort of out of usual, um, delays or, or disruptions there. 
I think in relation to solar, it is maybe a slightly different story. So, in the short term, again, we have the visibility. In many cases, we already have the panels actually in our possession. 
And so, it's, there's no issue there. 
Um, in the medium term, we are obviously monitoring the supply chain carefully and talking to the suppliers almost on a daily basis to really understand if there are any issues. 
So far, um, you know, 
I mean, the issues that are being highlighted 
have been delays, which could be, let's say 
a month, that's sort of the type of timeframe, which is really not material in the context. So, even if it's slipped a quarter, a month or the other in terms of profitability, we don't see that as an issue. 
But there is a degree of uncertainty in the at the moment. 
And so, we are working very closely with the suppliers to make sure that we have that, 
you know, we are able to close that, um, uh, timings so that we have better visibility on that. 
But again, um, I'd say on, on wind, certainly there's no issue there. In, in terms of solar, just a lack of visibility, 
which we are working through but so far we have not had any material, uh, let's say indication that we would be out of, um, not able to comply with the targets. 
M&A transaction definitely, you know, will be done on balance sheets. Uh, 
I think we have, uh, space for that. I mean, this is a transaction which brings also some operational megawatts with good profitability and also good pipeline. 
So, we would be deploying CapEx in any case, um, in the region. 
And so, in that extent, you know, we are not expecting to do anything different, you know, from what we would normally do. 
So, it would fit within the normal, let's say structure of balance sheet, um, that we would be assuming for the next couple of years. 
And if you want and we can also comment into bit more detail on that. 
In relation to net income, I mean, this year, obviously there have been, you know, as I mentioned earlier, there have been some issues which have impacted us. So, it's not a, it's not been a great year. 
We have had much lower wind generation. 
So, that is certainly something which has impacted the year. 
We've had some one offs like ERCOT, which again, um, obviously not, you know, impacted us earlier this year. 
Um, and also in terms of some of the, the hedges in terms of, uh, Spain, I think, you know, we addressed that as well, although that's, let's say more residual. So, really the key thing has been the wind generation. 
I mean, obviously we are ramping up growth and so ramping up growth means that we ramp up DevX, we ramp up, 
um, some of the growth, um, costs, but I think that's what they built into the, 
the numbers over the, certainly over the medium, uh, medium term. 
So that's, let's say the guidance. I could probably give you on that. Um, but anyway, we can come back to that, uh, again, if you want any, any more detail on that. 
Very clear. Thank you. The next question comes in from the line of Manuel Palomo calling from inaudible Paraba. Please go ahead. 
Hello. Uh, good afternoon and thanks for, for taking the questions. I, 
I've got, uh, follow up on the, on the transaction. I understand that today's inaudible transaction is not just a simple acquisition 
of assets, but could you please give us, uh, some, some additional information color about, uh, about the transaction in terms of operational data? 
Uh, I mean, in terms of, um, the expected, uh, IBITDA, uh, net profit maybe for, for the year 2022. 
And also if you give us a bit of the detail on those, uh, 540 megawatts in operation and under construction, how much is in operation? How much is 
under construction? 
And my second, uh, my second question is, uh, relates, uh, to the Spain. Um, 
I've seen that there's been a significant decline in the average selling price in the country from 80.3 to, uh, 58.5. 
So, I would ask for a bit of color on the granularity on the different components for these, 
uh, declining the price given the high wholesale prices that we are seeing. 
And also, uh, wanted to ask you a bit about, um, about your, uh, hedging policy for the, for the coming year or years in Spain. 
Uh, one question, uh, 
could be, if you have contracted volumes in Spain that could put your risk in case that, uh, the, the resource continues to, to inaudible. And 
the other question is whether did you give us an expectation in terms of, uh, volumes that are already hatched and also prices 
at, uh, which you have hatched volumes. Thank you very much. 
That, uh, thanks Manuel. So, in relation to the first question, 
I mean, some additional color I can probably provide for 2022 is that, you know, the expected EBITDA contribution would be around 50 million euros for ' 22. 
And we expect that to grow at around 25% Kager over the next couple of years. 
So, there would be north of a hundred million, certainly by 2025. Um, and hopefully, well, I'd say that. So, in terms of, um, let's say financials, 
uh, you know, and we don't go down to the net income level. 
In terms of megawatts the, 
um, so I, I'd say that talking AC operating end of the year, you'd probably be expecting to have around 430, uh megawatts. 
Uh, the rest would be coming in early next year. So, probably another 200 plus coming in, in, in ' 22 AC. 
Um, and hopefully more than that, but I'd say, let's say on the conservative side, that would be, that would be it. 
So, that's probably some of the color I can give it to stage in terms of the transaction. 
In terms of timing of closing, you know, it is subject to regulatory approval. So, we will have to go through that still before we can actually step into the company. 
So, what we've done is just signed, obviously the, the SPAs 
and we expect that would happen, 
let's say the most optimistic scenario would still be this year. 
Um, but given COVID et cetera, maybe early next year. So, in terms of actual closing of the transaction. 
In relation to questions, two and three, uh, where I can probably ask, pass it on to Julio as a- Thank you. Thank you, Miguel. Um, I'm inaudible. So, 
regarding Spain, so maybe I think it's better if I just, uh, no split this in three building block. 
So, let's start by the actual pre-hedging, 
okay. So, we have about 2.5 TWhs with, you know, generation, which is under the regulated framework. 
Um, and that on average, we have a price of 76.5 euro per MWh. 
Then we have about one TWh, so that's, 
uh, um, uh, merchant, those that capacity, which is under a merchant, uh, you know, on a merchant basis, so, outside a regulatory framework. 
And that was sold at an average price of 67 euros per MWh. I mean, this includes the, uh, the pool price, you know, the, 
uh, the, the WAF. So the, the Wind Adjustment Factor and so on and so forth. 
Um, no, in, if you build these two together, you get to an average price of around 74 euros per MWh. Again, this is pre-hedging, 
okay. Now the, the second part of this is that as you know, we have a, a hedging strategy to mitigate, 
uh, uh, volatility, uh, in, in inventory that we have a low risk profile. 
So, you know, before the year started, we have already approximately, uh, or as the was starting, we had approximately 2.2 TWhs, uh, 
of energy sold forward at 53.5 euros per MWh. So, 
basically when you combine these two plus the fact that you have a lower, uh, a wind resource this year in Spain, 
basically you get down to an average price of the 58.5 euros that, uh, that you, we were reporting and that you were referring to, 
um, again, the combination either, or this is the result of, and, and the combination of in one hand, the fact that we, and once we have the hedge in place, 
um, then, I mean, if there are, there is any Delta, uh, towards the regulatory hedge, um, 
I mean, that is, will be impacting the books and impacting the books. 
And secondly, because there is a, a part of this hedging that was, uh, that we had a shortfall in terms of volume, 
um, and therefore we were not able to, to generate the, the required power, um, and basically had to buy it at the higher, uh, market prices. 
So, it's the combination of these two factors, you know, what is the actual pre hedging plus the hedging that's, uh, yield this 58.5 euro per, per MWh. Um, 
as we move forward 2022, maybe here two comments. So, we 
have approximately 70% of our capacity, our generation hedged for, um, uh, 2022. 
Uh, that's an average price of 50 euros per MWh. 
As you know, I mean, there has been, there is now a discussion in terms of regulatory, um, 
you know, some, some potential regulatory change impacting the 2022, 
um, which, you know, the government is discussing this with different renewables associations. 
Um, so this is something that we have to wait and see what is the outcome, uh, of, of that discuss and to what extent it could potentially impact the, the hedging strategy, 
uh, towards 2022. 
I mean, if nothing changes, um, as I said, I mean, we have about, uh, 70% that's around 2. 2TWhs also had for ' 22 full year. Thank you. 
The next question comes in from the line of Jenny inaudible city. Please go ahead. 
Hi, thank you very much. Um, 
I have two questions, please. 
Uh, just going back to the point around, uh, supply chain, 
we've just heard, uh, on the inaudible core about, um, solar, uh, panel delays in the US and Vestas obviously reported today, and they highlighted some of the delays around 
onshore wind, uh, two out of three orders are being pushed back. Um, 
I understand, uh, you say that you've got very strong relationships, but I, I just wondered whether you can elaborate a little bit more 
around that. Do you have existing, 
um, uh, sort of contracts in place to, uh, effectively mitigate any, uh, or claw back any loss earnings on the back of any delays in, 
um, some of these supply chain issues, which may come through end of this year next year? 
Um, just, just really trying to understand where the, um, uh, where, where, where your strong relationships, how, how that manifests itself. 
And then, 
um, secondly, uh, on Sunseap, uh, Manuel's already asked quite a bit of the details. I just wondered, 
uh, whether you can give the debt number, the net debt number 
that you'll be taking on. 
And then very lastly, uh, an apologies for a newbie question, 
but when I look at, uh, 
E- Equinor, uh, when I look at Alstede, all of these companies are now starting to report at least give guidance around the EBITDA X gains. And 
I just wondered, um, to hear what your latest thoughts on that, 
uh, in terms of, uh, your views and including the gains in EBITDA. Thank you very much. Yeah. 
Thank you. So, uh, uh, taking the, the first question on the, the supply chain, 
I mean, first of all, cop you know, we have contracts obviously for everything that is under construction and that's, um, that we have secured. 
And so, to that extent, you know, those contracts typically, uh, have clauses which in the case of, uh, delays or significant delays, 
there are penalties associated with that. And, you know, that's, I don't think in anyone's interest that there would be those delays. 
We have these long term relationships. I mean, we've been in this business now for, you know, almost two decades. 
Uh, we're not the number one customer of Vestas, we are probably be close, depends maybe on the year. 
So, I think in relation to that, we, you know, obviously we work with them 
and, you know, try to have the best terms possible, but we also have the contract in place. And, uh, and we will obviously enforce those. 
And to the, as I mentioned earlier, you know, we have had no indication that there would be any 
delays on the, the project that we already have on the construction or that we are, let's say developing over the, the, the next year or so. 
In relation to solar panels, um, 
I mean, there, it's, it's not so much a question of, um, let's say, 
well, I'm sorry, in, in relation to pricing as well. I mean, obviously that's already built into the contract. So, when we lock in the, the CapEx, we're also locking in the pricing 
and, and, uh, yeah. 
And so, to the extent that it's closed, it's closed. 
If, for example, we are still in the process of an RFP or a tender or something, 
and there is an increase in the CapEx estimate, then we will see that through into the higher PPA prices or the auction prices. 
And so that's why I gave the example of, of Spain, where it's on an increase in the tender prices. 
And also in some of the PPAs that we are currently negotiating where we've gone back 
to the customers with higher PPA prices. Um, and since it's a general sector wide thing that's been, uh, accepted. 
Uh, so I'd say that that's the visibility that we have. 
In relation to solars, I'd say, um, 
again, we have good long term relationships with, uh, suppliers like LONGi, Boviet 
which are, let's say some of the, the top, uh, suppliers globally. 
Um, you know, to the extent that there is issues on pricing, and there have been, we are also feeding that through, into increased PPAs. 
In any case, when we talk about increases in PPAs were talking about maybe 
two, $2, two euros per MWh, I mean, that's the sort of size of the, of the Delta that we see in some cases. 
In terms of actual timing, as I said, there, there's some uncertainty, so we have had no indication that there will be any material delays. 
But in any case it is something that we're following closely. So, obviously we are, um, we know that there have been issues in the supply chain, uh, further upstream. 
And, and so, I mean, we're, we're continuing to monitor the situation, but, um, I don't have any specific, let's say guidance to give you on that. 
Um, apart from that, it seems to be manageable within the current context or within the current, uh, let's say estimates that, that we had given out to the market. 
In terms of net, sorryâ€¦ So, hopefully that answers the, the question or, or given you a little bit more color on the question. No, that's perfect. Thanks. 
In termsâ€¦ Yeah. In terms of the net debt for Sunseap so it's around 200 million. 
Uh, so I think we've given enterprise value 870 million, uh, equity value around 600 and something million. 
And so, I think that's the, you know, the Delta would be around 200 million. 
What, what ha- what we have said, however, is since that there, some of these projects are under construction, 
uh, over the next couple of months or sort of by the end of the year, probably the enterprise value would be closer to a billion because of the additional CapEx that will be in place. 
So, uh, let's say breaking it down into very specific numbers, EV 870 as of, uh, date of signing, 
uh, equity value 690, net debt 180. 
And, um, and as I said that the enterprise value will be closer to a billion by the end of the year, which is probably when we would do the closing. 
In terms of guidance, um, 
I mean, to be honest, 
we, we consider, and we have been considering now for a while that, um, the asset rotation strategy, something which is, let's say an intrinsic part of the business. 
I mean, 
uh, we build megawatts, some of them are to keep, others are to sell and we give visibility on those gains. 
And so, when you talk about X gains, 
I mean, what we've indicated to the markets, 
let's say in the context of our business plan, is that the capital gains implicit in the business plan are roughly 300 million per year over the next couple of years. 
So, if you look at the numbers that you have for EDPR, that's sort of the level of gains. 
And so, one minus the other would give you, let's say the guidance X gains. Thank you very much. 
The next question comes in from the line of Mikhael Zebala calling from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good afternoon, Miguel inaudible and Andrea. Uh, 
two question for, fro- from me please. So, as you pointed out in, in your slides, uh, the last draft of the, the US reconciliation bill 
is proposing 10 year extension for, for subsidies. 
Uh, would it fair to say that there is upside to, to your long term capacity targets from, from, 
uh, February. Uh, and could, could you give us an idea in terms of the incremental opportunity here, uh, versus your plan, if, if those extensions, uh, become a reality? 
Uh, and the second question is we've seen permitting issues in, in most of the European markets. Um, it's been a, a problem for new projects. 
Um, so could you, could you please discuss, uh, the visibility that you have right now where Sunseap pipeline given is, 
is, um, so big. This inaudible the, the operational capacity, 
uh, what can you tell us about the permitting situation in, in some of those Asian markets? Is it, is it better 
than in Europe and, um, also conscious that, that is a bit of a different game for distributed solar, 
uh, so is it fair to say that this is easier, inaudible technology easier to, to permit than utility scale solar? Thank you very much. 
Right? Yeah. So, I mean, great questions. In relation to the first one, I, I mean, I think actually your first question is slightly related to your second question as well. 
Uh, so the 10 year extension is absolutely fantastic. I mean, obviously gives a, a big boost to the industry as a whole in the US, 
and, you know, just continuesâ€¦ I mean, if renewables is already competitive, even without, 
uh, the PTCs, I think this really gives an extra boost, uh, to continue to growth of renewals in the US, both wind and solar, 
and also even other technologies like storage and hydrogen, which will also, and offshore, which also get, let's say that additional boost. 
I mean, I wouldn't want to necessarily give, uh, a specific target because I, I don't have one of upsides to the long term goals that we've given. 
What I would say is, I would go back to one of the, you know, the comments which I, I made, which is if we want to reach the targets, the overall sort of, um, say Paris agreement targets, 
the one and a half degrees, 
we would be investing 4 trillion per year globally as opposed to the 1 trillion. So quadrupling. 
I mean, obviously that's not the basis for our numbers. So, our numbers are based on let's say, let's say more conservative, uh, growth plan. 
But I mean, this is just a massive amount. So, I don't think the issue, I mean, the sky is the limit in terms of number of megawatts. 
I think the bi- big issue, uh, which is on the table in terms of how fast we can roll this out 
is making sure that each individual country has a very specific target. So they go from that more aspirational goals to very concrete, um, 
yearly goals over the next 10 years. 
And they translate that for example, into tenders or they translate that into sort of specific, uh, 
processes so that they continue to drive the demand sort of at the, the national and at the regional level. 
And, and then I think one of the things which we've also been highlighting both with the European Commission and also within associations like Wind Europe or Euro 
Electric is around the permitting issues. 
So I, obviously some countries are easy than others. Um, 
I think there is work that can be done there. 
And that's something that I know, you know, at the highest level in the European Commission and I, I think in the, certainly in the European Commission. 
They are looking at permitting issues, how they can, let's say, look at the best practices of different countries, 
come up with a list for example of countries and how, uh, they rank in terms of time to be able to get the permits done and to get projects sort of approved. 
As you know, can vary quite a lot between different countries. 
And so, I think focusing now on some of those issues and making sure those are, let's say more, are facilitated, 
I think that will help certainly translate some of these more ambitious targets into very concrete numbers on the ground and, and accelerate even more, uh, what we're currently seeing. 
In relation to Sunseap in particular, I mean, I think in Asia Pacific, definitely the issues around permitting are relevant 
because I mean, it is a densely popular region of the world, 
which is good and bad. I mean, it's, it's good because there's a lot of demand there, there's a lot of need to decarbonize economy. 
But it does mean that land is expensive and need to really manage, uh, let's say those permitting, uh, to make sure it's compatible with the local communities. 
I think that's why things like, you know, floating solar, um, or, or reclaiming land or offshore. 
I mean, all those or, or distributed generation, which is actually something which is really growing a lot in a lot of these countries, 
are ways of reaching those objectives. 
Um, let's say in a way, which is consistent also with the, the permitting issues and with the, the, the impact on the local communities. 
So I think Sunseap has been very successful in terms of what they've done over the last couple of years and the way they've positioned themselves for this. 
In terms of growth going forward, 
I mean, we're talking about, 
you know, probably being able to grow at 2-300MW at least in the short term per year, um, AC and sort of 3-400 DC. Uh, and 
I think, as I said, I probably upsizing that 
given the different markets and, and just given the overall size of the region. 
So, hopefully that's added a little bit of color too, to the question. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. 
The next question comes in from the line of Philip inaudible calling from inaudible. Please go ahead. Yes. Uh, good afternoon. 
Just three follow up questions. The first one is concerning, uh, the 540MW of Sunseap. 
Uh, you mentioned at 1 million euro per MW, which seems to be quite high. Could you just elaborate about this figure? That's my first question. 
You mentioned also 20 year PPA, which is a good news regarding the duration, but is the 670MW which are in operation and, and inaudible 
um, are fully under PPA means 100% of the capacity is under PPA. 
That's the second question. And the last question is concerning the valuation. 
Could you just elaborate how you are valued, the value creation you mentioned on the slide, 
11 means that, um, could you just give us some powerâ€¦ 11 means that, um, could you just give us some parameter you use or more simply, 
I would say, uh, 
this, uh, on the bracket margin generated versus the construction cost, which seems to be quite high, uh, somewhere around 50%. Could you just elaborate concerning this valuation? Many thanks. 
Okay. In, in relation to the first question. So the $540, um, million, 
I mean, it's high, but you have to think about it in terms of distributed generations. 
So we're talking about, um, let's say smaller m- project sizes typically would be in the single digit, uh 
megawatts and obviously in locations, which have, um, higher costs in terms of deployment, because of, because there are more distributed generations. 
So in terms of the CapEx, uh, you know, given the, the way they were developed, I think it's, uh, a normal or what would be expected. 
Also just to remind you it is AC and not DC and sometimes I think when people are comparing the, let's say CapEx numbers for solar, it is important to make that distinction 
because obviously it is, um, you know, AC and DC do have a, around a 20% difference. 
Um, so I think in relation to CapEx, I mean obviously we think CapEx will then continue to come down over the next couple of years, but let's say that would be one first comment in relation to that. 
In relation to the second question, the 20 year PPAs. 
So yes, um, it is pretty much fully contracted, uh, for the, the PPAs or, or regulators and 
I think that's mentioned here on one of the slides I, I don't have, 
so I can find exactly the number of the slides. 
But that is fully contracted 
and at the 70, around 75 Euro per megawatt hour. So 
I just also highlight the, let's say the, the price of the, or the implied price of those PPAs/ regulated. 
In relation to the value creation, I'm glad you asked the question. I mean, what I would say is, you know, we look 
when we look at these projects or we look at these acquisitions for our platform. I mean, we are applying the same type of investment metrics that we do for other projects. 
So in this case, we would be looking at, let's say above 2% spread, 
um, over our cost of capital. 
And that's assuming, let's say a relatively prudent, um, growth plan over the next couple of years. 
So let's say it would be basically basically taking the current, uh, operational projects and let's say in the margin on that, using that sort of spread, 
and then also looking at the future value creation that will be had with, uh, that growth, 
and the overall it has to be, uh, in line with our investment criteria. So around the 1.4 times, or, or at least above the 2% spread. 
So that's sort of the way we would look at it from evaluation perspective. 
That's why in terms of the slide, if you noticed, 
I mean, in the way we brought it up, it's the CapEx and then the value creation and the pipeline 
and those three bars actually sum up to more, or at least visually they should sum up to more look more than the implied enterprise value actually paid for it. 
Because we do believe we are, uh, getting a, a good return for this investment, assuming relative, you 
know, reasonable, uh, assumption. Ju- just for additional is this means that, um, for the, uh, pipeline of the 4.8 gigawatt you have taken the assumption that, uh, the, uh, utility scale business are going to be, uh, bigger down the, uh, 
Digi and means that your CapEx will go down toward the normal level what we're seeing in, in, in some projects around the world, somewhere between 0.5 0.6, that's 
correct to assume? 
What we've looked at, and then the, probably the best way to think about it is we've looked at what would be a reasonable growth rate or relatively, you 
know, being relatively conservative obviously we don't want to be too aggressive here. In terms of growth, uh, of megawatts over the next couple of years until 2025 thereabout 
and the implied value creation that we will be getting on that assuming our typical investment return. So, you know, around the 1.4 times work or above 2% spread. 
And so just saying is that implied in that pipeline, 
we're assuming that we will develop at least part of it, not all of it, but at least part of it over the next couple of years, that we will be creating value from that pipeline 
and that will give us a return which will be, let's say quite a bit higher than the 870 that we are paying for the platform. 
Many thanks. Okay. 
The next question that comes in from the line of inaudible Alonzo calling from Social General. Please go ahead. 
Uh, hi, good afternoon. Uh, just a couple of, of, of questions, uh, left please. 
Um, regarding the, the expansion into new markets specifically in, in a 
Asia, um, this is a, a solar platform, 
but, uh, do you think it could be, uh, uh, a good idea for you to, 
to look for a similar, um, uh, similar transaction or, or a similar approach for developing wind 
in Asia? Or do you think your capabilities are, uh, good enough to, to, to go and, and do it, that directly? 
And the, the, the second one is, 
uh, if you can provide a little bit of color about a work in progress that you do, do you expect to have at the end of, of the year? 
So, um, which amount of, of money will be invested and reflected in the net, but not, 
um, uh, contributing to, to EBITDA. Thank you very much. 
Thanks. So, in relation to the first comment, I, 
I think I um, I mentioned the presentation that we would look to leverage on this platform to bring our competenci- competencies in wins. 
Uh, so we are not looking and not thinking about, you know, buying any additional platform, uh, in Asia for wind. 
We think that, you know, given the team and the quality of the people there plus our own expertise and, you know, the people we have in 
internally, that we would be able to build on this platform to develop, let's say the, the wind, uh, component to it. 
So it's not in our plans to go out and do another acquisition for a specific wind platform. 
Um, in relation to the second question on work in progress, I'm just looking around, I'm not sure we have the specific number, perhaps we, 
you know, we can follow that up later, but it's not something I have here off the top of my head. 
Next question comes in from the line of Sarah Pacini calling from Media Banker. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. 
Uh, um, just, a clarification if, if possible about the, the dealer of, uh, inaudible. 
So how do you consider the, the distributed solar generation versus the utility scale generation? Do you think is a more 
risky business or they have similar characteristic? 
Characteristics, sorry. Uh, and when you indicate the 75 Euros per megawatt hour, um, 
I presume this is for, for the assets already secure, but do you expect to this tariff to be applicable also for the future projects? 
Um, and then also about the pipeline? Uh, I understood that large part of the pipeline is also related to floating PB, 
uh, can you please indicate a level of CapEx per megawatt for this technology? 
Uh, and then the second question is, 
uh, about the, the guidance. Could you please, um, indicate what is the level of EBITDA and, uh, net depth that you expect by year end, considering the $300 million capital gains and also the acquisition of inaudible. Many thanks. 
Okay, so, in relation to your questions in relation to the first one distributed generation versus utility scale. 
I mean, I think one of the key things, and, you know, we, we've obviously been doing a lot of work on Asia Pacific and seeing how we can take advantage of the growth opportunity there. 
It is quite densely populated, 
and I think that's something to, to bear in mind. So, uh, distributed generation there, which can be sort of, you know, two megawatt the, you know, that type of range 
or, you know, one to 10 megawatts type range, 
um, can be quite an interesting solution because it can be deployed much closer to the industrial customers or the customers that, um, let's say that we are entering into PPAs with, 
and then growing that, um, sort of that scale, uh, in the region. 
So it is relatively similar, I'd say 
in the sense that you have also specific counterparts. And I mentioned some of them, you know, whether it's an Amazon or Microsoft, uh, those are the type of customers that you can also have in this case. 
That's true for some markets. In other markets, for example, in Vietnam, 
I mean maybe you have a regulated tariff and so in that case, it would also be, let's say for the utility scale, um, it would also be something that we would be considering. 
Um, so from a technological point of view, it's not so different 
from a regulatory point of view. 
I mean, the key thing is also looking at the, at the regulation or at the, the counterparty. So I don't think they're very substantially very different businesses at the end of the day. 
And, and we're not talking B2C, we're talking, you know, when I talk distributed generation, we're talking basically CNI and the, and B2B customers. 
Uh, so I don't see it as a materially, very different business. 
In terms of the, the second question, the 75 Euros per megawatt hour so these are for assets already secured. 
I mean, obviously this will evolve over time, depending on, you know, the countries, depending on whether, 
um, you know, what are the, the CapEx assumptions that will be using or sort of getting for the different project. Uh, 
I would say that over time we would expect these numbers to probably start coming down 
as also, you know, the say the economies of sca- of scale start kicking in, in some of these, uh, geographies. 
So, but I would say they would still, they 
would still stay relatively high numbers, certainly compared to perhaps some of them numbers we see in other parts of the world, for example, like in Iberia or some parts of the US. 
Um, so the 75 euros per megawatt hour is for what we have secured. I wouldn't expect it to deviate too much over the next couple of years. 
In terms of floating PV, solar CapEx I don't have a specific estimate for that. Uh, we can get back to you, um, on that. 
When we are looking at, let's say, when we're looking at what is the pipeline, the value of a certain pipeline, 
the most important thing for us is do we think that we can get a positive value creation, a positive margin, uh, on the, the projects when we invest in them. 
And that's why the metrics that we look for, whether it's the 2% minimum spread or the 1.4 times work 
that's really what's most relevant for us. 
That needs to be technologically feasible, you know, we need to make sure we have a good a, counterpart and that PPA is, is competitive. 
In terms of the specific CapEx estimates maybe we can come back to you with that. 
In terms of EBITDA net income, uh, what I'd say is that, you know, we are still comfortable with consensus, 
um, and essentially it will depend very much on, as I mentioned in the presentation 
on closing some of the asset rotation transactions before the end of the year. 
So I think we're making good progress there. As you know, we have several transactions on track, uh, that we signed earlier this year. 
And so I'd say, you know, we will be above the $300 million that is our expectation, uh, by the end of the year. And so in line with EBITDA and net income, 
that's out in the market. 
And which I think has been given out by IR. 
Thank you. The next question comes in from the line of Ali Jeffery calling from Georgia Bank. Please go ahead. 
Hi, um, three questions from me please. 
Um, first is on, um, just going back to the poor wind resource that we've seen this year, I'm just ask giving, you know, asking the question again. 
Do you have any reason to believe that the P50 low factors that you're assuming in the future for wind should be lower? 
Um, for example, are you having any, are there any noises internally getting louder about having to look at this again? Or are you aware of any studies that are questioning, um, 
P50 low factors as we look at them? 
And also, are you looking into this, are you carrying out an assessment into this area to see if you're still comfortable with where the P50s are? 
And then the second question I have is just specifically on the Portugal and Poland, 
um, cells, um, you know, done at quite high EV to megawatt multiples two, 2.4 megawatts, 
can we expect when you complete these, that the gains that you get on these assets on a per megawatt basis 
are significantly higher than the, um, 250 per mega we saw at the beginning of the year? 
'Cause if you assume a typical CapEx, you might expect that the gains here are gonna be really quite chunky and in excess of 500,000 megawatt perhaps. 
Any comment on that would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. 
Okay. All right. So I think in relation to the first question, that's, I mean, the question I certainly ask internally constantly 
and, um, and so far, there's no reason to believe that this is changing. 
I mean, that's the honest answer. 
You know, when we look back over 20, 30, 40 years, I mean, you know, and look at the long term 
trend in, in sort of we factor in the last couple of years or in the last couple of quarters. 
I mean, there is volatility, there always has been volatility. 
It seems to be within the normal range and so the overall trend line does not seem to be, um, deviating. 
So, um, you know, there will be good years, there will be bad years, I mean, this is clearly not a good year. 
But, um, the only voice I think that is inaudible and myself, making sure internally that we are sufficiently comfortable to be able to tell you, and, you know, and the rest, 
uh, that, you know, we have no reason to believe that this is changing. 
And, um, and so that's the question we ask ourselves internally, and that's the assessments we've been looking at and sort of the statistics we've been looking at. 
And as I said, nothing has led us to believe that there is a change. 
In relation to the second question, um, 
I mean, yes, 
you are, right. 
I would say particularly in the case, um, of Portugal, it would be a higher, multiple per megawatt in Poland, um, it probably be more in line 
with the, the values that you indicated. 
I mean, we will provide specific numbers on the, obviously when we close them. 
It is all subject to adjustments and to, you know, changes, um, depending on the contractual provisions that we have with, um, 
the buyers. And so that's why we typically only give out the final numbers when we actually close the transactions. 
So, you know, hopefully by year end we will have done that and then we'll a- be able to provide additional information on that. 
But I would say, yes, I mean, your, your intuition is right that the gains per megawatt will be higher than the, the inaudible. 
Thank you. The final question comes in from the line of George Gamar calling from JB Capital. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. 
I just have two follow up que- questions if I might. 
Uh, the first is a, a technical one related to your, to your issues with the regulatory edging in Spain. 
I would like to understand exactly the mechanics of what happened in the quarter, 
uh, and if possible, if you can quantify what was the impact in the quarter of these, the regulatory edge as you might call it. 
And the second one, uh, is related to distributed generation, you are doing a, a massive, uh, push on distributed generation with this acquisition of inaudible. 
Uh, could we see, and this is a thing that you mentioned in the past. 
Could we see, uh, EDBR buying more platforms of distributed generation in other geographies? Thank you very much. 
Um, so in relation to the first one, I then pass it to Hui and, and probably more detail we can also then take it offline, 
um, just to walk you through the exact mechanics, but, but I I'll pass it to Hui. But so I'll just answer the second question first. 
And then before I pass the, the ball, 
I mean, in relation to DG, 
I think DG, well, first we're talking about typically these platforms are more B2B or CNI. 
And so the line between DG and, and utility scale sometimes becomes more blurred, certainly in certain geographies. 
So I think our position has been that the same way that we look at, you know, wind 
solar offshore, within these technologies, you then have slightly different segments. 
And sometimes these are blurred. 
So you can have, for example, utility scale in France, 
which can be maybe 10 megawatts and you can have a, what we would call distributed generation, which might be also some single digit or, or close to 10 megawatts depending, just because it's behind the meter. 
Um, so I think, you know, we do see synergies there and we do see these as different ways of let's say attacking the market 
in different geographies and also depending on the particular regulatory environment. I, 
I wouldn't see ourselves, you know, buying a lot more platforms or at least, you know, we don't have a strategy for going out and buying more DG platforms. 
We have done that selectively where we think it adds value to us. 
So this is one case, I mean, Santi does both, 
does it's expected going forward to do about 50% each, 50% utility, 50% more, let's say CNI, and DG. 
We have done that in the US with C2. So that's also complement to our existing platform in the US. 
And I think that also gives us a, a good insight into the dynamics of the, let's say the DG, uh, markets in the US. 
So again, we will do it selectively. We do think it's a good way, particularly in some geographies of getting access to, to more growth, particularly on the, lets say on the solar side. 
But it's not something that let's say we have a, an active strategy of specifically going out to buy more of those platforms. 
In relation to the first question, then I'll pass the ball, Hui. If you want to take that. 
Yep. Thank Miguel. Hi. Um, so I, I will definitely, we can take it offline and go through in more detail, but just in a, in a ballpark. 
So we have about â‚¬15 million, uh, impact that's â‚¬10, â‚¬15 million euros impact in Q3, uh, from this, uh, financial hedging in Spain. 
Um, our full year estimate is around â‚¬25 million on the basis of a P50, uh, wind resource in the, in the fourth quarter. 
Um, so that's, now the, uh, the amount sort of the, the range that we are talking about. Um, 
I mean the mechanics just, you know, in, in one minute is basically once 
if you're, if, if you have regulatory, uh, so wind farms on the regulatory framework, and if we are hedged 
um, uh, as you know? Any, if the price goes above the, uh, the regulatory cap, you'll have to get that uh, additional revenue back to the system. 
But if you are hedged because we decided to hedge some volumes within the collar so that we don't take that volatility, 
then you need to give back, uh, the Delta to your hedging and not to the regulatory cap. 
So that's what it's, it is impacting. But again, if you want, what I can do is we take it offline and go step by step so that you can get comfort on the numbers and the dynamics. 
Um, are we there? Thank you. That was the final question in the queue. 
Okay. Thank you very much. Uh, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks everyone. Take care. Take care bye bye.
