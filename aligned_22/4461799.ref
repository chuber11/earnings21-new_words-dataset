Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Galp's third quarter 2021 results presentation. 
I will now pass the floor to Mr. Otelo Ruivo, head of investor relations. 
Good morning, and welcome to Galp's third quarter in nine months, 2021 results presentation. 
I would like to thank you for joining us today and wish that you are all in good health. 
Today, Andy will provide an overview of the quarter performance and key strategic developments as well as an updated guidance for the full year. 
Philippe will then take us through the quarter financial results. 
At the end, we are happy to take your questions where Andy and Philippe will be joined by the remaining members of the executive committee. 
If you want to participate, please follow the operator's instructions at the end of the call. 
As usual, I would like to remind you that we'll be making forward looking statements that refer to our estimates 
and actual results may defer due to factors included in the cautionary statement at the beginning of our presentation, 
which we advise you to read. 
I will now hand over to Andy. 
Good morning ladies and gentleman. 
Galp's Q3 operational results were robust capturing the improved macro namely higher Brent prices and improved refining margins. 
We delivered over 600 million euros of consolidated EBITDA already at pre COVID levels. 
On top of this, we now have a renewable business, not consolidated, 
but fully capturing improved market conditions delivering 28 million euros of performed EBITDA in the quarter. 
We also generated a healthy operating cashflow of 468 million Euro. 
Therefore a robust contribution despite some operational challenges. 
However, our free cash generation reflected the temporary effect related with our gas hedging strategy 
and the significance spike in gas prices during the period. 
Due to this effect, as well as the interim dividend of 200 million Euro paid to shareholders during the period meant our net debt increased 
to 2 billion Euro. 
This puts us slightly above our targeted net debt to EBITDA ratio of one. 
However, we're expecting further deleverage through Q4 and confident that the dividend variable component will be distributed. And I'll cover that again later in this call. 
In addition to the actual Q3 financial numbers, we also made progress towards executing our strategy to create a more sustainable company. 
Finally, I'm happy to see the external recognition of our strategy with Galp re- currently holding, leading, leading positions 
on the relevant ESG rankings. 
Acknowledged further by the 700 million Euro lending we have secured from EID. 
Now, let's look at the businesses in more detail. 
During the period, we have seen some operational improvements in upstream, namely into Petrobras in Brazil, 
leading to a stronger oil output. Welcome at a time of high oil prices. 
However, due to some maintenance activities on Galp's exports, overall oil and gas production was planned quarter on quarter. 
During the quarter, the largest FPSO so far in production in Brazil was started up on the sepia field. 
Petrobras' delivery of the FPSO in these difficult times is to be commended. 
Although a small production contribution to Galp in the period, the production rate from the one world hooked up is prolific, boarding well for the full potential of the field. 
The FPSO in Atapu is also now producing at high levels, close to plateau production with only four wells connected. 
The Brazilian pre-sold continues to be an amazing story, 
with new wells demonstrating high productivities and strong reservoir potential. 
The improved operational conditions allow us to resume some inspection and maintenance activities. And through Q4, we hope to see progress on working through the maintenance backlog. 
We remain confident on the four-year production guidance updated last quarter 
at 125 to 130,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. 
Going forward, we expect the business to maintain its strong cash deliv- 
delivery with disciplined approach to CapEx focused on key attractive low carbon 
developments, such as backlow, a project, which continues to progress well. 
Coral FLNG from Mozambique also progresses well and is on track for first gas during 2022 with sail away from career expected during Q4. 
On the expiration of fore front, we are keenly anticipating key worlds in the Campos Basin in Brazil 
and in Saitama Princebay to be spurted later this year and early next year. 
On the industrial side, refining margins have now recovered from the weak environment throughout 2020 and early 2021. 
There are up to 70% quarter on quarter to $4 per barrel supported by an increase of middle distillate and gasoline cracks during the quarter. 
This refinery margin includes all energy costs, such as natural gas and electricity and any CO2 licenses we may need to acquire. 
On top of this. We're seeing gap's refining margin, October to date, at above Q3 levels, at around $5 a barrel. 
However, we need to report that we will see some production limitations during this quarter. 
As announced a few days ago, there was an unplanned event in one of the two furnaces of the Sines atmospheric distillation unit. 
There were no injuries, but it's led to a temporary stoppage of the unit. 
However, during the rest of Q4, the three put of the distillation unit will be restricted while repairs are completed on impact in furnace. 
We expect the issue to be fully resolved during this quarter. 
In addition, we have a planned maintenance in the hydro packer, which will start this week and should last around 20 days. 
Considering these operational limitations for Q4, we expect three puts of 15 million tons about 30% down quarter on quarter. 
While realized refining margins should stand at four to $5 a barrel. 
On energy management, this was a weak quarter impacted firstly by the extra costs related to the access to the LNG re- regasification terminal Portugal. 
These extra costs are now no longer charged from Q4 onwards. 
Also, with impact- impacted by negative effects by the all product supply pricing lag, resulting from the commodity price increase during the period. 
But most importantly, by unplanned natural gas sourcing restrictions related to our long term 
suppliers, which obliged us to acquire some volumes at expensive spot conditions. 
All in and, all energy management contribution was negative in the quarter. 
And going into Q4, we're setting with our main suppliers, any potential deviations from the planned deliveries, given the cost of securing alternative supplies. 
And we're preparing contingency plans to mitigate any potential shortfalls. 
Clearly shortfalls could have an impact on operations and results. And in such cases, we may continue to see some weaknesses on the energy management contribution. 
Therefore, unfortunately, Q4 for industrial energy management may not be stronger than Q3. 
Looking further ahead, we should have our Sines refining system operating in normal conditions by the end of this year. 
And I'm confident on the work we're doing on our gas trading strategy to allow some more flexibility and increased contributions from 2022 onwards. 
In commercial, 
mobility in Iberia is recovering with an all product sales increasing both in B2B and B2C segments, 
but still some 20% below pre COVID levels. 
Our results show this progressive positive trend where B2C has been recovering faster. 
But we now also see some positive signs in B2B, but aviation and marine segments do still remain weak. 
And the same time, we're taking steps to transform this business, 
to adapt to consumer needs. Uh, efforts to extract more from non-fuel have been proven successful. 
And our convenience retail is already delivering at pre COVID levels, and today represents over 20% of the commercial contribution margin, 
which is up 5% on 2019. 
With progressively increasing convenience sale and expect convenience contribution to more than double by 2025. 
In renewables, our production is sold under distraught merchant conditions 
and our generation capacity could have been hired this quarter. However, four plants have been restricted due to an issue with one transformer. 
And we've been implementing mitigations with some of the 200 meg- megawatts of impacted, uh, electricity. 
And we hope to get back to full operation in early 2022. 
But in addition, we plan to bring online an additional 236 megawatts of solar projects by year end. 
Meanwhile, we're executing our strategy and progressing with our renewable expansion inside and outside Iberia. 
In Q3, we acquired additional solar capacity in Spain, of 220 megawatts. 
And last week we announced an important step in our renewable venture in Brazil, where we acquired 600 megawatts of solar capacity, 
of high quality projects, projects in a pre-construction stage. 
The acquisition cost in Brazil were not material. Further payments, however made, but only when the projects hit specific development milestones. 
These projects are expected to be online before 2025. 
This is a clear step forward for Galp in the country where we've been present for over 20 years. 
And we've recently reinforced our renewables team in Brazil, a country which offers an opportunity to develop profitable, renewable power generation platform. 
But we will maintain our discipline. 
Entering in early a pre-construction stage and creating value by building up a por- portfolio from there. 
Our energy management team will be fundamental to capture market dynamic opportunities, 
monitoring the market development and valuing the best way to sell our power generation with a mix of PPAs and merchant exposure. 
These acquisition positions Galp with a 4.7 gigawatt portfolio with projects, both under operation, development and construction. 
This puts us in a strong podition, position to at least meet our 2025 goal of having over four gigawatts operating. 
And well positioned for the 12 giga- and visions we have for 2025. 
Thriving through the energy transition is not just about renewable capacity, 
but also about developing low carbon businesses and making sure we have access to finance structures to provide us an efficient capital structure to develop these projects. 
So what are we doing on this front? 
In early August, we launched a pilot of a new convenience concept store in Portugal with no fuel offering. 
And in Spain, we've upgraded around 35 stores, which are also showing strong results. 
We're also proceeding with our electrification plans having acquired in the quarter 280 EV charging points across Iberia. 
And we will end the year with over 1,000 points, more than doubling since last year. 
And step further to reach the company's ambition by 2025. 
On new energies, green hydrogen plants are becoming real, currently developing a two megawatt pilot with FID expected by year end. 
This will accelerate our learning curve before the larger capacity electrolysers get closer to reality. 
We're advancing simultaneous with two projects of 100 megawatts each. 
One by ourselves and the other one in a consortium. 
On another front, we are thrilled to have secured access to funding to our low to no carbon projects by prestige ent- entity, like the European Investment bank. 
This includes an up to 750 million Euro to finance solar PV projects in Portugal and Spain, 
as well as the rollout to 550,000 EV charging points across Iberia. 
We've also secured project finance for 50 megawatt project in Spain, operating in full merchant conditions. 
All our operating projects in Spain have now been project financed, all with debt level above 70%. 
Looking at 2021 overall, 
considering the status of operations and adjusting to the short term ma- macro outlook, 
assuming a $70 breadth for the year, 
we estimate now full year EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow to stand above 2.3 billion Euro and 1.8 billion Euro respectively. 
While on the operational side, commercial industrial energy management 
should stand below the estimates we, we provided last June on the back of slower anticipated Iberia into mine recovery and restrictions in energy management. 
But upstream and renewables will benefit from higher oil, gas and power prices. 
Our CFFO, non-ad adjusted operating cash flow is predicted to have a 400 million Euro difference to our adjusted operating cash flow. 
This impact is mostly driven by a hedging strategy to protect the commodities price risk related with our gas sourcing and supply activities. 
In the recent months, we saw an increase in margin deposits related with future contracts as a result 
of the unexpected significant spike on gas prices. 
This impact drives mostly from contracts that will end in 2022 when the supplies are delivered to the customers. 
Therefore going forward, we will see cash inflows yielding CFFO levels above the OCF, 
either when we make these gas deliveries or when gas prices are just downwards. 
Philippe will elaborate a bit more on this later, 
but let me in- reinforce, despite currently materially impacting our CFFO and net debt, 
this is a temporary effect. One that will be reverted on the short term during 2022. 
We are aware this may impact our shareholder distributions framework. 
We will need to monitor how gas prices evolve and what will the effects on financials be at year end. 
By then, we will take a view. If some adjustments to the dividend framework should be considered when proposing our 2021 distributions, 
given the one off and temporary nature of this impact. 
Lastly, on net CapEx, we are now estimating 
the year end be at the lower half of the previously provided garden guidance. 
So to stay within 0.5 and 0.6 billion euros demonstrating our continued capital discipline. 
So to wrap up, this quarter benefited from the more supportive macro, 
and we continued seeing positive signs of recovery and a strong commodity price environment ahead. 
This environment is causing some temporary impacts on our cash delivery. But as I mentioned, these are temporary and will revert. 
More importantly, looking further ahead, we are starting to show clear and important signs of stress the 
execution, both around our legacy, business' growth and transformation, but also around expanding our renewables footprint and moving forward with new businesses. 
Our operational rement- momentum has room for improvement, 
and I am confident we will see a turnaround, allow us to deliver even stronger results. Finally, 
a relevant part of our investment case is to maintain a competitive shareholder remuneration. 
We are conscious that our shareholders deserve to be rewarded in such a strong macro environment. 
Therefore, we are monitoring very closely the evolution of the lines impacting our net debt and CFFO 
and confident that we will be able to recommend a variable component related with 2021. 
Now, over to you, Philippe to look more deeply at the financials. 
Thank you, Andy. And good morning, everyone. 
I am on slides 12, where we have the 
upstream EBITDA of 522 million, which clearly benefited from the rise in Brent prices 
even if we did continue to see below average premiums on the cargos we sold to Asia. 
And this comes from China restrictions on some local importers and regional crudes being priced more competitively versus Brent. 
Our oil and gas realizations versus Brent were also affected by the cap we have for now 
on our Brazilian associated gas sells. 
So the current gas price formula is capped at $55 Brents. 
Upstream CapEx was 187 million, and this went primarily 
to our pre-sold developments, namely Tupi and Bakaleo, and Koral in Mozambique. 
The CapEx line this quarter also includes 34 million payment for the acquisition of a stake in BMS8. 
This increased the Galp's stake from 14 to 20% back in 2017. 
And the payments were contingent on certain milestones. 
And the final one should be distributed in Q4 or early Q1 next year of about 40 to $50 million. 
Commercial EBITDA was 87 million in the quarter. 
Now this with seasonal quarter on quarter higher oil product sales and the gradual easing of lockdown measures. 
Still commercially EBITDA was down year on year as the margin environment is been pressured by the current much higher commodity prices. 
Industrial and energy management EBITDA was only 15 million, that's down 35 million from the previous quarter. 
The Sines Refinery had a healthy contribution with realized margin of $4 per barrel and cost of $1.50 per barrel. 
Energy management however, saw gas sourcing restrictions 
leading to spot purchases to comply with our commitments with clients. 
Also, as we had flagged before, the increase regasification costs in Portugal impacted EBITDA 
with about 10 million euros during this quarter. 
In oil products, the rapid commodity price increases that we are seeing in the period has caused negative 
price lag effects under the formulas we have established with our clients. 
Industrial and energy management operating cashflow includes the contribution from associate companies, 
such as the Galp's stakes in the international pipelines, which bring the gas from Algeria through Morocco and Spain. 
Now, after some 25 years invested in those assets, these concessions will end this month. 
So we will now bring the Algerian gas through the Medgaz Pipeline, where we are not an investor. 
On renewables, now you know we do, you know, we don't consolidate this business. 
So what we show here are proforma numbers and the proforma EBITDA was a very healthy 28 million in the quarter. 
Now, we do continue to see significant supply chain and permitting challenges to develop and build the renewable projects in Liberia at the speed we wanted to. 
But we remain committed to deploy the ambitious pipeline of projects and grow the installed capacity. 
So short term, we have over 200 megas of new build capacity coming online by year end. 
This is most welcome in this environment. 
And in addition, we should also see the transformer issue, uh, resolved shortly, and this has kept about 200 megawatts offline. 
On slide 13, 
here, you have the P&L where you see the EBITDA of 607 million in the quarter. And EBITDA follows this, uh, in tandem. 
Associates were up to mainly from the increased net income from our solar JVs. 
Net income was 161 million under RCA. 
Now under IFRS, 
net income was negative 334 million 
driven by the negative 545 million in special items. 
And this comes mainly from the market to market of our hedging positions. 
Now, these price protection contracts do not qualify under IFRS hedge accounting roles. 
So we need to take this volatility to the P&L as opposed to equity. 
So throughout 2022, 
The revenues we generate from the gas volumes that underline these derivatives will compensate these market to 
market variations as it is designed to. 
So the hedges are made to reduce our economic risks. 
So no worries here other than unwelcome temporary volatility. 
The cashflow on slide 14, you see we are strong operating cash flow for 168 million. 
Now CFFO is affected by the working capital built, resulting from the margin deposits 
to cover the exchange rated derivative positions. 
And maybe Otelo, we should spend a minute on this derivative and margin deposit topic. 
So in the P$L, we have the market to market of the entire derivative book. 
And in the cash flow statements, we have the cash that we need to post as collateral with the exchange. 
The number is quite high this quarter, 373,000,444 
for the full nine months. And this is the reflection of how much gas prices have gone up. 
And why do we enter into derivatives in the first place? 
So we buy gas from our suppliers and we sell the gas to clients. 
And the business model is to make a commercial margin between the two. 
However, the gas that we buy is mainly priced off Brent 
and our sale say to industrial clients are normally TTF linked. 
So we therefore protect the basis risk of the price of what we buy and what we sell through the derivative market. 
So effectively, the gains that we could have made from the recent sharp increase in TTF versus Brents, 
those gains are neutralized by the derivatives. 

So if you exclude these derivative margin accounts, which are temporarily, 
the free cashflow was a healthy 260 million in the third quarter. 
This is all from my side, Otelo, um, we'll now take your questions. Thank you. 
To ask a question, you will need to press * 1 on your telephone. 
In the interest of time, we ask participants to limit their questions to two each. 
To withdraw your question, please press the # key. 
Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. 
Your first question code from the line of Beraj Bukacha from RBC. Please ask your question. 
Hi there. Uh, thanks for taking my questions. Um, apologies. I cut off on my, this might have already been covered, but two, two questions. The first one's on the sort of she distribution. 
You mentioned a number of times about the, the temporary nature of the, the margin impact. 
So as we're thinking about your full year dividend, i- is it fair to just strip that number out and then run the calculation on, on that CFFO number? 
Um, and then the second question is on, um, what you mentioned on gas sourc- sourcing. Um, you highlighted some contingency plans, um, for gas sourcing in the fourth quarter. Um, 
I was wondering what, what exactly that would entail. 
Uh, thank you. Thanks, Beraj and then thanks for your question. Look, I have to say that, you know, we have set up to now that we are just gonna do a mathematic calculation on the, the supplementary dividend, 
uh, we will do a mathematical calculation on that. And, you know, depending on that working capital build, we'll, we'll see what that yields. 
What I think we're saying here is there will be, uh, we've agreed with the board that there may well be a discretionary element that we will add to that. Uh, 
I can't tell you today how that will be calculated or, or what there will be, 
Beraj, but I think, you know, what we're, what we're indicating here is that we think this is a very much a one off issue that, and the shareholders shouldn't be penalized for it. 
So, um, you know, more to come on that one. 
On the gas sourcing, you know, I think this is about, you know, we are, um, having some issues with our gas supplies and, you know, with the current gas markets, as you might imagine, 
um, replacing and buying new cargos, um, you know, can be really expensive. 
So we're very much looking at the, at the demand side of that and seeing, you know, what we can do to reduce, 
um, our, our own use as well, uh, to be honest with you, Beraj, and, and to see how we can mitigate, um, any potential sourcing constraints we get in the quarter. 
So, you know, we're turning every stone and, and would be very reluctant to go and 
buy new volumes to the kind of spot prices we're seeing today, 
to be honest with you. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alessandro Pozzi from Midiobanca. Please ask your question. 
Hi, good afternoon. Uh, thank you for taking my, uh, questions. 
Uh, um, the first one is on the, um, upstream guidance, uh, 
I believe in Q2. You mentioned it would've been a, a bottom line of the guy, of the ranger for 2021, but you maintain it. 
And I was wondering, 
uh, um, how you would think about maybe the exit rate in, uh, Q4. 
And maybe if you can give us maybe some, 
uh, some key date for 2022, I believe, uh, uh, the start of course, uh, is one of them. And maybe you can give us an update on that one as well. 
That's, that's my first question, Uh, thank, uh, thank you, Alessandro for your question. Um, 
I think I'll hand over to Tori to talk about the, the upstream position. 
Thank you, Andy. Um, so with respect to the upstream production and the guidance for the fourth quarter, 
I think you can expect the production that it's very similar to the one that we have seen in the, the third quarter. That's our key guidance to you. 
With respect to 2022, that's a bit early. Let's revert to 2022 at the capital markets day when we have consolidated all our numbers un- unless it's for, for next tier. 
With respect to Coral, uh, the product is going extremely well. 
Um, and, um, it now it's, um, very visible that we will have a sail away from, um, Korea in the middle of, uh, middle of November, 
then it's sails to, um, to, uh, Mozambique, um, for the offshore commissioning 
and, uh, in our plans, uh, we have first gas in the second half of, uh, 2022. Thank you. 
Okay. Thank you. The, uh, the second question on, uh, uh, renewables, uh, um, 
I think part of your strategy is to, uh, farm down, uh, some of your oppositions in, uh, in certain assets. 
Uh, and, uh, given the spike in the electricity price, do you think 
this is potentially happening sooner rather than later? And yeah, in general, I was wondering if you can give us an update on, uh, potential, uh, disposal opportunities there. 
Uh, that's sassy. Thank you for your comment. 
I mean, I, I, what I, what I'd like to just, um, say is that what we're doing is we're building a portfolio. We talked about 4.7 gigawatts. 
Um, we're continuing to build a portfolio to give us more options, um, to make sure we are delivering the gross capacity of, of the four gigawatts. 
In terms of our sell down strategy, you know, clearly we, we haven't yet got firm plans of when we are gonna kick that process off. 
Uh, we are diversifying the countries we're working in with our announcement now we're moving, uh, into Brazil. 
Um, but there will be a moment, um, when we will both look at, at some sell downs, um, particularly when we de-risk the projects, 
uh, but also, you know, at what, look at what time, what timing we would take some, some more PPAs 
because we're, we're entirely merchants at the moment, which is obviously, um, good with the current, current prices. 
Uh, but over time, I think we will want to position, um, more in the long term 
markets, um, but no, nothing definitive, um, to share at the moment. So thank you for that. 
No, just to follow up on, on Brazil. And do you expect to sign PPA, uh, for the new asset? 
Yeah, I mean, Brazil has quite attractive index linked, 
um, both 
public, um, you know, so, 
uh, both open commercial and, and government, uh, PPAs that, that we can, um, take part in. 
But it also has a very attractive merchant market at the moment. 
We, we probably will plan to do a bit of both, 
um, to get a strong underpinning for the project, but then to enjoy some of the upside, um, in the merchant market. 
At the moment in Brazil, there is, has been quite a str- significant drought, uh, which is, um, putting some distress into the electricity system. 
Um, and therefore, I think there will be a, it'll be very welcome for us to build some more renewable capacity there and take part in the, you know, electricity growth that they are seeing in that country. 
I think they have an ambition for something like 40 gigawatts 
of renewable cacity- capacity by 2030. So a very attractive market for us to, uh, to participate in. Thank you. 
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Alford from city. Please ask your question. 
Uh, thank you. Uh, good afternoon. I've got a couple, just pressing on the upstream. I was wondering whether you could update us on when we might expect, uh, a new development plan for Tupi, 
which could help offset the declines that we're going to see from the field, I guess, in the next year or so. 
Um, and then secondly, just to follow up on the gas sourcing, uh, question from earlier, 
um, I appreciate you, you're looking at mitigating the, the cost impact of, of gas sourcing, uh, in four key, but I, 
I don't know if you could maybe look out a little bit more into 
2022 and, and, and why do we not still see, 
I guess, a headwind around the costs, uh, associated with, with buying that gas, uh, for more of a medium term impact on the business and energy management? Thank you. 
So, firstly, can I ask Tori to talk about the plan of development for Tupi? Tori. 
Thank you, Andy. So, um, the work with the, the new plan for operation and the development on Tupi and RSM is actually going really well and, and the partnership, 
uh, uh, it is significant work already done. I think the document is now in the order around 900 pages. 
Uh, the expectation and the full intention from the partnership is to de- deliver this plan to the AMP by the end of, uh, end of this year. 
So that's the, uh, forecast and, uh, the plan seems to be being a robust. Thank you. 
Yeah. So on the gas sourcing, um, kind of early to, to talk too much about 2022. 
Uh, clearly we, we wanna build more flexibility, uh, into our position in terms of, you know, 
I think for me, for us, the lessons learned a bit that we, we did hedge 100% of the volume and, and I think going forward, we, we are gonna have to look to, 
uh, to give ourselves a bit more flex if we do have supply, um, restrictions. Uh, you know, I I'm, 
I'm quite optimistic about the long term, we've got Venture LNG coming in 2023. 
Um, and I think we can position that in the market, uh, in hopefully in a, in a strong profitable basis. 
So no, no specific guidance on 2022. 
The only thing I can say is we've secured the regasification here in Portugal without the premium that we paid up to the end of Q3. 
So going through 2022, we'll still enjoy, um, a lower cost of regasification of the LNG that, that is delivered. 
Um, but I think we've now got a much better handle on our ability to respond, um, to any, um, sulla- supply shortfalls, particularly looking at, you know, some of our own use and, and, and how we can, 
how we can build more flexibility in that balance over time. 
Great, thanks. And just to follow up on Tori's point on the, uh, sure development plan in Tupi, 
um, is it there a prereq- prerequisite, sorry that, um, you need to get a license extension? And if that is the case, um, how, how is that going in terms of that negotiation? Thank you. 
Okay. Uh, thank you, Michael. 
Um, without going into too much detail on this, uh, Michael, uh, but you can, can expect that we will have several elements into this plan 
and some of the elements in the plan will also then be requiring a license extension. Uh, 
correct. Uh, so this, we are expecting that there will be, um, uh, some discussions going in in order before the whole plan is, uh, is for… 
We are looking for 20 or plus extension on the, on the, uh, field life actually. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. 
Your next question comes from the line of <unk> from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your a question. 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Uh, I had two please. Uh, the first one was related to Brazil production. 
Uh, last quarter you talked about, uh, preventing maintenance impacting, uh, production uplift in the second half of 2021. 
Just wanted to check if, uh, you could comment on the progress here. Uh, yeah. Is the maintenance activity completed in 3Q or is it still persisting in, uh, into, into the fourth quarter? 
Uh, the second one was related to your, uh, shareholder distribution policy. Again, uh, last quarter you mentioned, uh, that you're reviewing the option of using buybacks. Uh, 
I was just wondering if you have reached the decision on that, or, uh, will we see, uh, uh, the incremental, uh, inc- the increase in the shareholder distribution are reflected in the additional dividend. Thanks. 
Let me just start with the second. 
Um, what I have said, and, and what we are doing is, is looking at, um, and, and consulting with shareholders around, 
uh, buybacks versus cash dividends. 
And, and that work is still ongoing. So I have nothing to report on that at this stage. Um, but just to, to reaffirm, you know, we're looking and, and, and consulting with the various shareholders about that. 
On the Brazil production, I'll, I'll hand it over to Tori, in, in a second. 
I think, you know, one of the difficulties, um, that we've had, and actually, you know, we see this in, in other parts of the world as well, where 
through COVID, 
um, clearly there was a maintenance backlog increase, but also a delay in hooking up wells, 
a delay in doing work 
overs. Um, and so I don't think this is, uh, constrained, uh, just to Brazil. But Tori, anything more to add on, on the normalization of the situation in Brazil? 
So Sophie, we, we are moving in the right direction still, however, being constrained, 
um, just to give you a sort of in one indicator and while the POB was restricted, around 60% of the capacity 
has now increased a bit. So we are around 80% of POB capacity on the different insulation. So we have more, 
uh, hands on the deck in order to, to work with the, uh, the backlog. 
Uh, it's now being worked systematically and, uh, we expect that there is two units that is scheduled for, uh, maintenance in the, in the fourth quarter of this year. So it's picking up, 
but there is a backlog and that will take some time to, to be sorted out. 
Thank you. Thank you everyone. Your next question comes from the line of John Rigby from UBS. Please ask your question. Hello. 
Thank you for taking the call, uh, taking the question. Um, 
I think this is for Philippe I guess. Um, I, I noticed the, the sort of step up in come contribution from renewables, obviously with the, the high electricity prices. 
And that sort of flows through from your performer EBITDA into, mainly into associates, um, as you've noted. 
Um, can you just help and run through the, sort of how both the, the earnings 
and then also the cashflow cascade kind of works into your income statement into your consolidated account? So I'm particularly interested 
maybe where, where you are 
doing, 
um, uh, refinancing. Um, does that reappear back in your cashflow statement as a dividend or as a divestment? 
Um, uh, I just wanted to sort of understand 
and what the allocation and priority of cashflows would be to paying interest versus paying dividends 
back to yourselves, uh, paying, um, back 
some of the capital on the, uh, loans, et 
cetera. So if this makes sense, some sort of, um, map of how cash flows and earnings work back into your, into your business, if that, if that's possible. 
Good morning, John. Um, I don't think what we are doing and will do is different from, uh, what we've done with other associates or what everybody else does. So you have unconsolidated entities 
are currently generating more cash. 
So that cash goes to pay project finance and OpEx, of course. Yeah. 
And whatever is left under the financing agreement, as long as you comply with debt service code ratio, then you distribute the cash, 
uh, as dividend. 
And when you use that cash for CapEx, but we will show the numbers gross. So all the cash that comes to Galp comes from in the cash flow statement as, as a dividend income- 
Yeah. and CapEx will be gross. So the money goes back into projects for expansion. 
On the P&L, what you see 
is the share of profits, it's an accounting number, share of profit that goes under associates in the, in the P&L. 
So because we have very long term funding, you know, the one we've just closed as an 18-year maturity, 
we do expect depending, uh, on power prices, of course, we do expect 
significant cash flow monies coming in over the next few quarters. 
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. That makes sense. 
Um, can I just ask a follow-up question, 
um, just on, on Mozambique? 
Um, um, it's really about the, the onshore project, uh, itself and not really about the, the, the delays or, or visibility around that. 
But just as, as the 
sort of at a higher level, just as the, um, the world is starting to focus very much on, um, scope one, scope two, uh, emissions around new projects, 
is there's a dilemma, um, or a paradox with, with LNG, is that scope one scope two can be actually quite high or very high, 
although scope three, sort of full life cycle can be relatively competitive, including there's some advantages in terms of, of clean air where you are, you are using the gas to generate electricity, et cetera. 
Does that present a problem for you in the context of your plans around, um, um, going to, to lower emissions zone, to, to net zero, 
um, in terms of being a participant in that, in that project or is the plans ultimately 
to physically, uh, deal with the, the carbon, uh, that will be omitted as part of the process of, of liquefying, uh, the gas? 
Thank you. Thanks, John. And I'll, I'll be asking Tori to, to follow through you. Clearly, you know, our net zero commission, uh, position is 2050, a long, a long way off. 
Um, particularly gas, as you know, particularly in the Asian context, uh, replaces coal, so, so, so it's positive. 
Um, but we are very focused on what the scope one and two emissions of the LNG plant, um, being designed are. So, I mean, Tori, do you want to explain some of the things we're looking at? Yeah, 
I'll do that. Thank you, John. 
Uh, so yes, actually, one of the things that is being looked at as the, the product now is, 
um, is being revised, ah, and we are using this time in order to see how we can optimize it further. 
One of the things that also then is looked into is how to reduce the CO2 emissions from the, um, from the, uh, from the plant. 
And, uh, with that in particular mind, what you just, uh, mentioned, John. So that is one of the factors that is now being, uh, being put on the drawing board. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Giacomo Romeo from Jefferies. Please ask your question. 
Uh, good morning. Good afternoon, actually. And thank you for taking my question. 
Uh, 
I have, uh, two, uh, left on my list and, uh, first one is, if you can talk a little bit more about, uh, the size of the Brazilian renewable opportunity and sort of what sort of, 
uh, uh, what sort of pipeline beyond the, the sort of capacity that you announced you see? 
Um, and the other question still on renewables is, uh, if you can give an update on how the, uh, search for, uh, the new CEO role is going, 
and when you expect to sort of have, uh, an update on that. 
Okay, thank you for the question. 
Uh, look, the Brazilian, uh, pipeline is a significant one. We've announced, um, a participation in two projects of total 600 megawatts. 
Um, but we are looking at a much, a much bigger funnel of opportunities there, both in solar and some in wind as well. 
Um, but no deals done yet, uh, but we continue to look at how we can expand away from that position. 
Um, I, hey, look, I, can, we have selected someone to be the new CEO. 
Um, we haven't gone public on who that is yet. 
Uh, but just to say that that, that process has gone well. Uh, I'm very excited about the individual that we will be able to announce that will take that business to the next level. 
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Stone from Barcode. Please ask your question. Thanks. Hi, good afternoon. Uh, two questions please. Um, first just like clarification on the dividend again. 
You mentioned there's gonna be some discretionary elements, 
but you you've quantified the year to date number at 400 million euros of what you're losing on these temporary derivatives. 
So would you not be able to know exactly what that number is at year end and just, just add it back? 
Uh, and then a comment on that is why not change the structure to be linking or dividend to, to the operating cash flow, X working 
capital, you, you might, might create more, more simplicity in, in the structure? 
And then the second question on the upstream production run rate as you're going through the rest of the year, you mentioned that the main- maintenance backlog is improving, 
but it looks like quarter and quarter volume's looking pretty flat-ish. 
Can you maybe just quantify how much are you lo- losing in production due to this maintenance issue 
and therefore how much is to play with when we're going to next year and thinking about what might come back? 
Thank you. Thanks, Josh. Um, you know, I, I, 
I don't want to give any definitive guidance on how we will calculate the supplementary dividend. It, it will, we believe it'll be partial. 
Um, we have, uh, permission from our board to say that the, this will be, uh, considered, but no clear mandate on, on the magnitude of that. 
Uh, when 
we, yeah, when we look at our mechanism, 
we use CFFO because normally managing working capital is quite a bit of hard work in, in terms of managing stocks and everything else. 
I mean, this is a distinct one off that we really couldn't control. 
Um, but actually not only affects CFFO, it affects net debt. 
Um, so both those parameters, uh, are affected by this, this one off, um, margin account build. 
Uh, but I can't, I'm not in a position today to give you a definitive calculation method, uh, for how that supplementary dividend, 
uh, will be calculated. We'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. What the macro, 
what our OCF is, how strong the company is at the end of the year, 
um, before we declare what that supplementary dividend will be. Um, 
I think I'll hand over to, 
to Tori to talk a little bit about, you know, what we've seen in terms of shut in production and, and how much, uh, there is behind the pipe there. Tori. 
Thank you, Andy. Um, thank you, Josh. 
So when it comes to maintenance is 
a part of life. 
That's the natural part of the way we do the business. So also going forward, you have to expect that we will, um, have a periodic maintenance on the different units, 
uh, in, uh, in, in, uh, in all of our operation. 
Typically the, the chartered FPSOs have, uh, 10 to, uh, 15 days of maintenance, uh, every year. 
Uh, on the replicants uh, we have a longer, but more periodic maintenance typically that is 20 days, but then only every three years. 
It's done with more force and typically also connecting with the flotel. So you have more, uh, people to, to, to, to contribute. 
So, uh, what I can say is that, uh, 
we expect going forward that maintenance will be more or less as we have guided before and have impact in the production in the order of around 5,000 barrels, um, um, 
per, per day. 
And that is the best guidance I can give you also going, going forward, uh, Josh, on that. Thank you. 
Thank you. If I could just follow, if you could say how much the impact is this year, so far versus the 5,000 barrels a day. 
So Josh, actually, um, in front of me, I don't actually have that number, 
uh- That's fine. in front of me. So, sorry, I can't answer that here now. No, that's fine. I can, I'll have to follow up with you. Thank you. Thank, thank you. Thanks. 
Your next question comes from the line of Medi Anabati from Bank of America. Please ask your question. Hi. 
So good afternoon all. Thanks for taking my questions. So we, if, uh, my questions have already been answered, but I have some, um, some, some issues with the, the connection. 
Uh, the, the two questions on my side. Uh, first regarding, you know, your, your gas sourcing, uh, issues. 
Um, can you tell us if you could get some compensation, you know, from your insurance, as it seems you are not, uh, uh, receiving contractedness uh, from suppliers, 
uh, or maybe, you know, explaining again, why you, you can't get any, uh, compensation 
please? Um, and, um, given the natural gas price development, should we expect, uh, a significantly higher negative impact 
in the first quarter compared to, to, to, to the third quarter, 
just for us you know, to avoid, uh, let's say a big, uh, negative, uh, surprise, please? 
And, uh, the second question is more about, you know, um, uh, stakeholder dividend pay to, to Sinopec. And in case you didn't pay 
any dividend in the third quarter, should we then expect two dividends, 
uh, to be paid, uh, in the first, uh, quarter, uh, or you just decided to, to skip, you know, the, the sales personal dividend? Thank you. 
Let me… Uh, thank you, Medi. Uh, let me answer the first question. I'll ask Philippe to do the second and third. 
Um, now we are, indeed we're in intensive, uh, negotiations with, with our suppliers to say, to try and mitigate any impacts. 
Um, there are some, 
uh, penalties, but I have to say that there are a very small fraction of the difference between the spot price and, and, and the market pri- and the price we have actually, um, secured for those volumes. 
Um, so that, that really doesn't compensate, uh, the difference. 
Um, but indeed it, you know, it is a discussion we have, and we're obviously working really hard to make sure that there is no interruption and, and we're able to supply our customers, um, um, without, um, missing a beat. So, uh, 
I can't give you any numbers on how much we would recover from, from any, uh, lack of supply. 
I can say we are in, um, active discussion, uh, with them to make sure that they do supply. So Philippe, second and third question? 
Hi Medi. Um, your question is on working capital in Q4 and how does, uh, TTF change that? If I understood correctly. 
No, no, I, no, the question 
was about Sinopec. Okay. Yeah, that one, that one, I got. Okay. So on, on Sinopec, what we have agreed with Sinopec way back then 
is that free cash flows after paying all CapExs are distributed out 
30, 70%. 
So depending on the free cash flow, um, this year and next, 
um, and, and the following years, the, the role is quite, uh, straightforward. 
So this year, we're expecting, um, an, a payment. So within fiscal year 2021, 
say 120, a 
hundred <inaudible> depending on what the micro will do, 
and next year, 
uh, it's not necessarily payable in Q1, is we'll look at what the cash flows for 2022 look like. And 30% of the free cash flows 
will be distributed out sometime during next year. Thank you. And, and about the first quarter payment to Sinopec? 
Should we expect you to, to be back to normal in the <inaudible>? 
Again, it is not necessarily payable in the first quarter. 
So we paid the Galp shareholders in the second quarter, 
and we discuss with Sinopec depending on what the cash flows are, CapEx commitments, the best timing of payments. 
So we have quite flexibility on timing of payment. 
But within 2022, then it should be about 30% of the free cash flows. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. 
Your next question comes from the line of Michele Della Vigna from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. 
Thank you. It's uh, it's Michele here. Two quick questions, if I may. 
The first one, I just wanted to check that Coral FLNG because it's offshore would not be in any way affected by the security concerns that are lingering in Mozambique. 
And then secondly, I was wondering if you had a chance to start looking at your business through the lenses of the EU green taxonomy, 
and, uh, if you have an early indication of what 
percentage of revenue and CapEx will be taxonomy compliant for you. Thank you. 
Thank you, Michele. 
Uh, so on the, the, the current security issues, you know, largely this is a well offshore and, and therefore, um, we believe, uh, outside, uh, the current insecurity, 
um, clearly sure bases exist, um, but in places which, uh, where I think, uh, security is, is better guaranteed. 
So at this stage, um, we do not have any, uh, specific concerns around that, but we need to stay alert of course. 
Um, on the use of taxonomy, I, you know, I think it's, it's early days for us to, to make any, um, clear indications to the market about, uh, the proportion that would fall under that, um, requirement. 
So at this stage, no update on the EU taxonomy. Thank you. 
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Candy from Santandery. Please ask your question. 
Oh yeah, thanks. Um, going back to Brazil and, and maybe a couple of the earlier questions, 
uh, is, is the Brazil renewable asset base gonna be consolidated or non-consolidated? 
Will you treat 
it differently from the Iberian, uh, renewable business? Um, and what kind of CapEx do you think is needed to build out that, um, Brazil, solar 2025? 
And if I may, um, obviously you're looking at asset rotation, uh, in renewables, and you've got this target of 12 gigawatts by 2030. 
Am I my best to assume around 50% of that would the net capacity for Galp, uh, 2030? Thanks. 
Thank you, Jason. I mean, I think firstly, the way we are actually approaching Iberia as well, so the one gigawatt we've essentially added to the original ACS deal, 
um, plus Brazil is that in the first instance we develop it. 
Um, and then only after the COD, when it's online, that we will sell, sell down and, and deconsolidate it. 
So, um, that is our current modus operandi. 
Um, and you know, clearly we will also finance, uh, um, these, uh, these projects. 
Uh, so, you know, I think, uh, that's the way we, we, we will go about, 
um, those projects. The, the CapEx renewable costs have gone up a little bit in the, um, globally in the last, uh, six, nine months. 
Um, 
but yeah, I'm, I'm not, I won't give you any, any clear guidance, but anything 
between, 
what is it, 500,000 and 700,000, uh, per megawatt would be, would be in the ballpark of how much, uh, it costs to develop these projects. 
But we hope to get, 
you know, 65, 70% or more financing as well. So the equity, uh, contribution is, is, is far lower. 
Uh, um, and I think that also answers the, the asset retain, yeah, the 12 gigawatts. 
Yeah, I think we will continue to… You know, we talked about essentially a, um, dilution of 50% in our portfolio on the 12 gigawatts position. 
And, and we, we maintain that. 
I think this is all going to be, uh, based on opportunities on being able to maintain the deconsolidation. 
Um, and when we can rotate it, so the timing of it, when we can rotate those assets, 
that we've de-rationed significantly that we can sell down to a strategic investor in order to leverage up our own returns. 
So I don't want to give any firm indications when we're gonna do it, how we're gonna do it, um, but I think it's about a discipline that we want to instill within the renewable business 
about how we make sure that we do get and, and have an opportunity to get double digit equity returns 
on our renewable investments. 
Now that's great. Just to clarify the 500 to 700,000 was, uh, dollars? Euros. Oh, euros. Euros. Euros. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ignacio Dominic from JB Capital. 
Please ask your question. 
Yes, good afternoon. And thank you for taking my questions. 
I have to, my first question is on refining and the positive evolution of refining cash costs. Uh, can you comment on what has been driving this trend 
and where should we be refining cash costs going forward? 
And then my second question is on, on renewables. I think you mentioned, uh, generation was impacted by a transformer upgrade. 
Uh, so my question is, uh, when do you expect this issue to be reverted 
and if you would expect any, any compensation to this, to this impact? Thank you. 
So let me start with the transformer issue. Um, clearly this was part of the legacy in the joint venture we had, uh, with AC- ACS. 
Uh, we've had 200 megawatts that have been, uh, outta capacity. 
Uh, we 
have we're on the verge of putting 65 megawatts back in online to, to compensate for that. Essentially a transformer that was allocated to a future project, we we've now retrofitted. 
Clearly, at this time of year and going forward with lower solar radiation, 
uh, that really helps, uh, mitigate if not totally mitigate the, the, losses we may get in the fourth quarter. 
But we have new transformers that are arriving to installed in 
just in the new year, um, early, early months of next year, that to have us, um, completely ready to go once the sun comes back in Iberia for, uh, for Q2 onwards. 
Um, now when we comes to refinery, uh, cash costs, we've talked about driving down to, um, $1.70 per barrel. 
Um, 
clearly, safety comes first and costs comes second as we, we continue to emphasize to, to our people on the ground, but Tori, do you wanna talk a bit about the, 
um, the cash costs and what we might see in Q4, or particularly with also the, the work we need to do on the, on the furnace? Yes. 
Thank you, Andy. 
Um, you're right. So the overall ambition has been to drive down the cash cost and, uh, be in the area of, um, slightly below $2 per barrel. 
However, as you know, we have had an, um, operational issue in the, um, in the atmospheric distillation unit, 
which we will need to repair. The repair is actually ongoing as we, we speak that will impact our cash cost for the fourth quarter. 
And, uh, our current best estimate is that we will be spending around 10 to $12, uh, million on, on, on those repair 
that will translate into the, to the cash cost. So 
I guess the best guidance I can give you today is that the fourth quarter, you will see it around $3 per, uh, per barrel 
as an indication for what the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, cash costs will be for the, for the fourth quarter. 
We, however, believe that the by, by this quarter, we should be back into normal operation unless we are getting any, 
um, surprises during the, uh, this repair, 
uh, repair work. So all work is that this is completed during 
this quarter. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rafael Dubois from Societe Generale. Please ask your question. Hello. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two left. The first one is, uh, still about this working capital buildup. 
Um, assuming that the TTF price stay where it is now, 
can you, can you give us a feel for what the working capital builder could look like in Q4? 
And then I have another question about renewables. You talked about 60 million Euro of, uh, Pro Forma EBITDA. 
Can you tell us what utilization rate you assume as well as the solar capture price that you assume as well? Thank you. 
So, can I ask Philippe to answer the first question? 
I have felt compared with what we have on the balance sheet on September 30, 
we have calendar 2022 TTF was training at about 57 euros. 
Uh, it is currently at 54, I think. 
So given what, where we are today and where we stand, I would say it should get a bit better- 
Okay. uh, but it is incredibly volatile. 
So it's very hard to call the shots on what, uh, December 31st. And this is a daily market to market number. It's, that is every day. Yes. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Hi, Rafael. Yeah, just on this renewables question. Um, moment to, well, in the Q3, we enjoyed about 110 euros per megawatt hour as a solar capture price. 
Um, clearly our generation capacity comes down in Q4 as, and we get less sun. 
Um, but we will have about about an extra 100 megawatt available online to, um, to enjoy whatever sun we do get in the, in the fourth quarter. 
Um, so, you know, that's, that's really 28 million was the Pro-Forma EBITDA for, for the Q3 to give you an idea of what kind of run rate 
clearly it would have the extra 20% that would've been, um, somewhat higher. 
So that that's, that's the current position we're in. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Lofton from JP Morgan. Please ask your question. 
Hi, thanks for taking the questions, uh, two, if I could please. First, just, I wanted to come back to the operational outlook in pre-sold Brazil and the earlier comments. 
Um, could you just share a sense of, of how the operational backdrop has evolved since perhaps the update you provided in the summer, 
um, where the, sort of the maintenance backlog sits 
today compared to the middle of the year and how long you expect it to be able to, to work through before you get back to the normalized 
for 5,000 barrels a day plus minus of, 
um, annual maintenance effect that, that Tori, I think you referenced earlier. 
And then secondly, just on price realizations of the upstream, we've seen a wider 
average oil and gas realization discount, the headline. Brent, the last couple of quarters, 
I think you've highlighted softer pricing or, or more competition into Asia on the Brazil exports. 
Um, how do you see the outlook there looking into 2022? Is this something that you still expect to be temporary and ultimately revert 
or something that could become more of a medium term structural issue? Thank you. 
If I can just start and I'll hand over to Tori to, to add on the Brazilian, um, outlook. 
And we did a, quite a full analysis of what we produced this year versus what we'd hope to produce this year and to try and understand what, 
what the key issues for the shortfall were. 
I mean, what we found was one of the biggest thing is just how it takes a lot longer to hookup wells now, whether they're new wells or their work over activities that need to be done. 
Um, we had also, and we've mentioned this issue about the, um, the riser issues and, um, tests we've been doing on the corrosion, the stress corrosion, cracking corrosion of, of, of rises. 
Um, and Petrobras' done a lot of work on that and 
that has, that has an impact, um, of a couple of points of availability at the moment and, and for, for a short time to come. 
Uh, and then there's the overall, uh, availability level of the, of various FPSOs that, that Tori was, was just, was alluding to. 
And then lastly, there's a reservoir performance, and I know a lot of people are being stunned about it, but what we found the reservoir actually performed slightly better than we expected, 
uh, this year. So, so I think there's some good use below the wellhead 
in terms of the, um, the reservoir itself. It's, it's these compounded issues 
that we have above the wellhead that I think, you know, that we're, that possibly are working through. 
Any more to add, uh, Tori? No, 
I think, um, on the, on the, on the maintenance, I think you've covered it, uh, well. 
It's, uh, actually to, to sum it up 50% of the shortfall, uh, we have seen this year is due to delays in well connections and, uh, then there's another 20% that is related to, 
uh, um, delays in, in well work overs. So that's, that's really is capturing the, the majority. 
Uh, it actually has been slightly positive. What have happened on the, on the issue of stress corrosion, 
we, we, uh, the inspection that is, was done over the summer actually proved to be better than anticipated. So that meant that, um, a few producers could be put back in, in operations, uh, 
before 
expectations. So 
hopefully, and crossing fingers that is now going forward in, in a good, good way. The long term solution, however, that will take some time, 
um, because that will require new materials to be, um, 
uh, qualified, uh, for that, that issue. 
Um, and when it comes to the price validation, uh, the market that's very much dependent on the situation in, in China, 
we have seen that the, the Chinese market has been, um, somewhat more difficult in the, uh, in the, in the, in the third quarter. 
Uh, so the, uh, the discounts, uh, has had to be a little larger in order to place the volumes. 
Let's see what the role of the independent refiners, uh, in, uh, in China will be going forward that has a direct impact on that, that market and, uh, the old outlook. 
So we will stay, uh, with the, 
uh, with the, um, uh, with the sort of same guidance that we have given you, but expect it to be, uh, for this quarter in the area of eight to $10 per, per barrel, less as a discount overall. 
And that's factored in, which is very important what Andy also said in his speech, uh, in the beginning that 
our gas prices in, um, Brazil, the, for the associated gas is actually capped at $55. 
Uh, so, uh, there is a there's, um, there's a limit to, uh, to how much we can get on the, on the, on the, on the gas side. 
However, that ends, um, by the end of this year. 
So from next year, we, uh, we will actually dispose and handle the, the natural gas, the associated gas ourselves in Brazil. 
And that should give us some more, um, uh, capture capturing a higher, higher margin on that. Thank you. 
Your final question comes from Anish Kapadia from Palissy Advisors. Please ask your question. 
Oh, hi. Um, yeah, just had, uh, one question remaining. I think you, you touched on it slightly, 
but, you know, we are seeing, um, evidence of quite strong inflation and it could be quite persistent inflation in, in the market. 
And you know, I'm thinking about that both from 
the raw material side of things, but also the, uh, the potential for, um, higher inflation and higher interest rates going forward. 
So I was just wondering if you could cover the, the impact of that in particular on, on the renewables business of those higher import costs coming through, but also from a, from a financing perspective and a returns perspective of how you think that, um, higher inflation and higher interest rates could, uh, potentially imp- impact our business. Thank you. 
I'll ask Philippe in a second to talk, uh, a bit about interest rates. 
Um, you know, I think one of the benefits of our joint venture that we secured with ACS was, was it locked in construction costs going forward. 
So, um, we've largely, de-risked particularly with the 2.9 gigawatts that, that we have in that, in that particular deal. 
Um, but what's interesting about these higher costs 
and perhaps the risk of higher interest rates is, 
you also see a bit of a slow down in people building more capacity and, you know, as result that feeds into 
what we also see, particularly at the moment is, is clearly pretty high, uh, solar capture prices. 
Um, so I think these things have their own balance to them. 
Uh, we have pretty strong position in that we, you know, we've, de-risked, uh, the construction costs in our deal with, with ACF. 
But Philippe, do you wanna talk a bit about the interest rates and, and how exposed we are to that? 
Anish, because we, we project finance, the, the banks ask us for a very significant proportion of the funding to be swapped fixed rates. 
So we are fairly hedged on the funding cost. We're fairly hedged through the EPC, uh, contract we've signed with ACS. 
Um, we are seeing unit CapEx prices going up. So everything is becoming more expensive, 
uh, access to land interconnection, equipments. 
Um, actually quite a number of auctions took place recently, a number of bidders were betting on declining CapEx numbers. 
And they've bid very aggressively. 
So also to be seen how many of those projects will actually get funding and get off the ground. 
So we'll see less projects being, uh, built more challenge for those that are not hedged. 
Having said this, um, we're seeing a lot of inflation on the price of the electrons that we see. 
So net net, 
this is not, um, necessarily a bad for the projects and in the short term. Um, in the longer term, we we'll see, 
but Galp is mostly hedged. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. 
I think this ends our sessions. Thank you for your time and for participating. 
Uh, we hope you find this is update useful. As always the best relations team is available for any additional qualifications. 
We will be on the road again from November onwards. So really hope to meeting you in person soon. 
Have a great day and a productive hunting season. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.
