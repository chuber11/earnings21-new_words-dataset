Mr. Ririek Adriansyah for his overview. Please, Ririek. Thank you, Andi. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call for the first half of year 2021 results. We really appreciate your participation in this call. Amidst prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, Telkom saw positive results by recording 69.5 trillion in revenue, increased 3.9% year-on-year. 
Expenses increased but at a slower rate of 2.8%, 
resulted in a better profitability. EBITDA grew by 4.7% while net income increased by 13.3% year-on-year. 
This achievement showed that our business plans are on the right track towards a healthier 
condition and stronger fundamentals throughout the end of this year. IndiHome continue as the inaudible 
for Telkom revenue and profitability. Its revenue reached 12.9 trillion, grew by 24.2%, supported by additional subscribers and better ARPU. 
The strong performance resulted in the increase of the consolidated revenue from 15.5% last year to 18.5%. 
IndiHome profitability also continued to improve with EBITDA margin of 47.6%, a significant increase 
from 38.6% in the first half of 2020. 
During 
the first half of 2021, IndiHome inaudible added around 285,000 new customers despite the pandemic situation 
that might slow down physical marketing activities and installation of new lines. 
Meanwhile, ARPU improved to 270,000 Rp 
in the second quarter from 266,000 Rp in previous year. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Telkomsel saw improving performance 
amidst challenging cellular business environment. Telkomsel's revenue in the second quarter of 2021 grew by 3.5% as compared to previous quarter. 
Payload consumption reached almost 10 GB per data user, a substantial increase of 41.4% year-on-year. Revenue contribution from Digital Business is consistently increasing and reached 
70- 
77.3%. Digital Business, Data, and Digital Services also grew by 4.7% year-on-year to 33.4 trillion, and that's been the key 
driver of Telkomsel as a digital telco company. Digital Services sales grew by 28.1% among the retail products and digital lifestyle, advertising, and enterprise solutions. 
Enterprise segment successfully grew by 12.2% to 8.7 trillion 
Rp, with IT services and enterprise connectivity solution remained the biggest contributor to the segment revenue. 
This saw consistent improvement in our turnaround strategy. 
In the meantime, 
Wholesale and International Business segment recorded revenue of 6.9 trillion, increased by 1.2% year-on-year, supported by increasing tower business, data center, and A2P services. 
In the period, total fixed line business contribution has reached more than 40% of Telkom's consolidated revenue and more than 30% of Telkom consolidated net 
income, reflecting healthier and well-diversified our business. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Telkom continued to build synergy and collaboration with digital and technology companies. 
After an additional investment in May 2021, an additional leading digital company, Gojek, in 
August 2021, Telkom also signed an MoU with Microsoft to explore cooperation in the development of intelligent infrastructure 
with development of digital talent and acceleration of Telkom's group digital transformation. 
Telkom's Venture Capital MDI demonstrates strong capability and performance. 
MDI port- portfolio has shown an outstanding performance in terms of inaudible, exit strategy, and synergy value. 
MDI has invested in more than 50 start-ups in 12 countries, 
of which three companies have done IPO and six companies have been successfully acquired by third parties. Moreover, 
inaudible had two unicorns in its portfolio, NIUM and Kredivo, and other two companies are expected to be the next unicorns. 
With this achievement, MDI has brought positive impact on Telkom's Digital 
Business. We are building up capacity in data center and cloud business. 
Today we operate 26 data center facilities, 21 domestic, um, and, and five overseas with total capacity of around 43 megawatts. 
In first 
half of 2021, data center contributed 713 billion, um, in revenue or 
increased by 11.7% year-on-year. To enhance our capacity, currently we are in the progress of developing new type of data center which is a Hyperscale Data Center, certified as Tier 3 and 4 
in a total area of 65,000 square meters near Jakarta. 
Our Hyperscale Data Center will be completed in stages, and, and the first stage is expected to complete by end of 2021 with a capacity of 25 megawatts. 
At the final stage, Hyperscale Data Center will have capacity around 75 megawatts. In tower business, 
after we successfully consolidated tower assets, Mitratel own 
23,000 towers with tenancy ratio of 1.57 as of June 2021. 
Mitratel as a stand-alone company booked revenue of 3.2 trillion in the first half of 2021 or grew 10.9% year-on-year. Mitratel 
EBITDA margin also improved to 76.8 in first half of 2021 
from 69.7 in the first half last year. 
The realignment of tower portfolio within the group is actually to enhance Mitratel value and 
at the same time will make Telkomsel to put more focus and efficient on its core services. 
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude my remarks, let me share our main guidance for the year of 2021. 
One, we expect that consolidated revenue to grow by low to mid-single digit. 
Second, EBITDA margin is expected to be relatively stable. Third, 
capital expenditure or CapEx for the group is expected to be around 25% of revenue excluding additional CapEx on 5G. 
That is ending my remarks. Thank you. 
Thank you Ririek. We will now begin the 
Q&A session. inaudible May we have the first question, please? Yes sir. Certainly. 
The first question comes from the line of Piyush Choudhary from HSBC. Go ahead. Hello. Yeah, um, thanks for the opportunity. 
Congratulations to the management team for the great set 
of results. A couple of questions. Firstly, on your, uh, mobile business, 
could you share some light on the competitive dynamics? Uh, we've taken tariff hikes, um, so 
is the tariff hikes likely to sustain? And what are the other potential levers for ARPU development in mobile business? 
Secondly, on data center, 
um, what is the total CapEx annual for the new Hyperscale Data Center of 100 megawatts, 
inaudible? And, um, how much is already spent on that? 
And, uh, if you can share in the first stage, like, 25 megawatts is coming, uh, how much of the capacity is already pre-sold? Thank you. Hi Piyush. 
This is Rachel. I'll take your first question regarding the mobile market competitive dynamics. 
I think, uh, to your question which is, um, are the tariff hikes sustainable and what's our outlook on ARPU? 
Um, just to recap that since the end of quarter one, Telkomsel has already taken initiative to signal to the industry that it's necessary to halt unhealthy pricing practices in the mobile market. 
Uh, we need to make sure that RPMBs are good and the profitability is strong as an industry. 
So we had stopped unlimited, um, and we have increased our prices progressively in phases over the last few months. Un- unfortunate- <silence> Hello? A.J. Pardon the interruption. 
We have lost the line for speaker Rachel. Other presenters, please take 
over. Heri, can you take over? Uh, uh, can I, uh, continue with the second question, uh, while we're waiting from, uh, uh, continuation from the first question? 
Yes. crosstalk On the second question, uh, Piyush, uh, the total CapEx for the new Hyperscale that are currently under construction, around 70 million USD. 
Uh, it is 1 / 3 of the capacity that we can build in the property that we have 
here. So, uh, I think gradually, uh, along with the 
inaudible I think, uh, uh, expanding demand, we're going to, uh, inaudible now that we already built. 
So, uh, that, uh, that's the situation now. How many? Uh, I think, uh, client, uh, uh, that we have or user 
right now, we are in the process of, I think, uh, selling this pre-sell to the users, potential users. 
For your, uh, info, in our, uh, data center in Telin in Singapore, for example, the utilization there is 
already around 
82%; in Indonesia, around 76%. It means 
we, uh, have a list of, uh, I think, demand for, uh, uh, selling these capacities. Hope 
that answer all your question. Yeah. Thank you for that. Thank you for that. This is very helpful. 
Piyush Choudhary, I'm back. Uh, should I continue? Yes. Thank you. 
Hello? Yes. So, um, I inaudible changing the prices, uh, in, 
in- I think inaudible, so I think in terms inaudible, we should assume the health is inaudible, however, inaudible now is their support inaudible, the customer. 

The student will have some inaudible and will be inaudible, so 
those are the, some of the, uh, challenges we might foresee in terms of our inaudible. 
Nevertheless, inaudible approving, uh, overtime. 
I hope that answers your question. 
Thanks, inaudible, thank you. Thank you. Your 
next question comes from inaudible. Go ahead. I inaudible, uh, get 
some clarification on the inaudible items, like really inaudible. Be aware of, are 
there inaudible? Uh, second, inaudible investments, can I 

get any clarify on that inaudible invested a million dollars into this. 
What kinds of inaudible you normally take inaudible to offer these investments inaudible on the inaudible and how big a inaudible do we have? 
And on the Microsoft deal, 
third question, what do you, 
what do you expect to see with this deal with Microsoft? Is there any specific target on, on, uh, internal revenue as a cost savings that can happen inaudible. 
Thank you. Hi. inaudible, uh, I can answer your questions inaudible. Uh, it is inaudible 
because 
we have our inaudible plan, uh, I think corporate system that there is inaudible, 
to, to have some, uh, inaudible company inaudible. Uh, and then, 
on the, inaudible relative 
to the, uh, inaudible, uh, specifically, inaudible 
performance inaudible, 
expected to decline. inaudible 
pension benefits also in case in this one, in case, uh, inaudible. 
I think inaudible. There is enough there. 
I think that what it 
is 
is inaudible. We still can manage this one. inaudible. inaudible too, 
for loose inaudible items at these levels pulling into the next quarter, that's 
how we did the inaudible. Uh, I think this is maybe part 
inaudible employees, inaudible, uh, inaudible this one, but over all, 
I think we don't have any kind of, uh, something that, inaudible 
along the time, becoming more, uh, more inaudible. Okay. 
Yeah. Uh, and then, 
inaudible uh, inaudible nine hundred million, it seems, uh, inaudible. 
We are, uh, more than inaudible, uh, inaudible in developed country, 
so there, what we can say that, uh, 
I think, uh, we compare the inaudible, uh, uh, I think, uh, part of the inaudible. So, uh, inaudible 
there is income that we have from the fund, uh, above that, uh, I think a 
trace of it independent inaudible investment. 
The inaudible, uh, quite, uh, inaudible, so- Dip their hand in the dollars 
has been deployed already? For example, inaudible type? Uh, 
the inaudible. So I think, uh, inaudible. Now, uh, in the inaudible, I think we, 
uh, we can, 
uh, collect inaudible of nine hundred, so 
I think I already have, uh, uh, quite 
many, uh, 
in different plans. inaudible you are aware inaudible. Too much important inaudible, did a similar inaudible, 
so within Microsoft inaudible. We 
don't have to be using it at this point. 
We are just, uh, lay down our, uh, inaudible. And 
working with Microsoft is, is, uh, is one of the, 
one of inaudible similar companies, because, uh, we do deliver with, uh, IP inaudible 
do they get them if, inaudible? Thank you very much. Thank you. The 
next question comes from inaudible. Go ahead. Hi. Uh, thanks 
for the call, this is inaudible from inaudible. uh, three questions from me inaudible other questions. Um, first, 
on the mobile, inaudible that we are inaudible with, uh, you know, with 
the next wave of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, 
uh, I just wanted to, uh, get your thought as to whether you think, uh, you're inaudible some risk in terms of the development of competition. Uh, 
I just think some of the smarter players, perhaps, uh, uh, adjusting the prices might appeal to consumers, uh, you know, the cust- the, uh, the lower inaudible power? 
Or is everybody just inaudible and you think inaudible compare to prices going up, uh, even including the following. That's 
question number one. 
Uh, second question, uh, in regards to the inaudible, uh, uh, 
I just wanted to clarify that the 70 million dollars that was mentioned, this is just for the first space, uh, is that right? 
And, uh, does that inaudible equity inaudible or is the land, uh, uh, leased? 
And my third question is, uh, with regards to, uh, MBI, uh, you, inaudible $909, is 
that what we are inaudible or, 
or do we foresee that potentially going up for inaudible the 900 million dollars, uh, fund that you mentioned 
and oh, the inaudible value in terms of the current, the current value. Those are my three questions, 
thank you. Hi, inaudible uh, I'll take your first question. inaudible and also inaudible, 
um, inaudible power inaudible so the operators inaudible. 
Now we're looking to lower denominations to inaudible. So, 
not inaudible for the customer base. 
Thanks. Hi, inaudible and this includes the inaudible. 
And then on the MBI, 
uh, of course there's, uh, uh, potential, but we gong to embrace the inaudible on this one. 
As you may know in this region, uh, the growing of the inaudible, very high 
and I think we have many inaudible and others 
so we still have inaudible on this one, so, uh, 
I think we will continue to see the inaudible deliver the political 
inaudible. Uh, company. 
inaudible that we can build with them, uh, inaudible making 
our company more difficult. Okay, and what is the 
current value of this, this investments? And, 
and another follow up, uh, is you mentioned just now that the, uh, the inaudible acquisition of land, 
uh, is, is that the land just for phase one or have you also bought the land, uh, you know, for phase two and phase three already? 
Uh, we already bought all that, the land, uh, for the inaudible, uh, and then, 
uh, your question on the, uh, specifically what is the value of the 700? Uh, I, unfortuneately cannot, uh, disclose that one, 
uh, but, inaudible one 
of the plans inaudible investments and inaudible, they already, uh, inaudible 
around 2.5 billion. 
We can have a gain of 100 million from this one if that happens. 
I think, uh, uh, it will, uh, uh, we can have one of them, inaudible on 
this one. Okay. Thank you so much inaudible. 
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of inaudible from inaudible. Go ahead. Yes, uh, thank 
you. Uh, inaudible, uh, so basically, my first question is on, is on the, uh, data centers. Uh, you mentioned that it's about, uh, 
currently inaudible 43 megawatts, uh, how 
much of that is used for, uh, telecom, telecom group, uh, 
purposes and, uh, you mentioned inaudible is about 76% 
inaudible currently, yeah, uh, yeah, how much of that, how much of that is, uh, is used for, uh, telecom, 
uh, in terms of inaudible. 
That's question number one. 
Uh, question number two is about, um, what, what is the, 
uh, uh, um, in the last could of days, they mentioned in the, in the inaudible that 
there's a potential for anywhere between, um, uh, inaudible and telecom. 
Is this, uh, is this, um, eh, eh, in lieu to this or is, uh, 
some, some, uh, part of that has been, uh, uh, inaudible, from both sides, uh, 
extensively, uh, and, uh, what, what type of, uh, the screen for this, uh, for this corporation. 
What are the scenario, what are the scenarios that, uh, that you, uh, that can be considered? 
Uh, as a corporation between, uh, the, the two, I believe, in the physical inaudible space, yup. Thank you. 
Uh, thank 
you for the questions, and, uh, inaudible 42 megawatts, uh capacity for our inaudible. And the second question, inaudible- inaudible the- the- the inaudible was 
led by the inaudible, uh, inaudible. So, I- I- 
I- guess that's yesterday, inaudible discuss anything inaudible. We can not give 
you any- any- any information at this point. All right. Thank you inaudible. Uh, could I have 
a follow up on the- on the data set, on the- on the new 25 uh, megawatts, uh, capacity. 
inaudible intends to uh, occupy how much of that? 
And uh, maybe uh, I can inaudible out one more question, if I may? 
Uh, on uh, it's a follow up question from uh, from- from- from a previous participant. 
Uh, with relation to the- to the inaudible price hike. Uh, 
how 
uh, uh, what has- what has driven you to- to- to uh, to increase 
inaudible price hike at this- at this point? 
Uh, are these uh, are these on a nationwide basis or a- or a- a- a- selectively implemented? 
And uh, are- 
are there- are inaudible promoted, 
like for instance inaudible or uh, the- the marks inaudible? 
Yeah, so uh, so basically uh, what has really inaudible this point to- to- to- to inaudible price hikes and uh, 
and how, uh, yeah, how confident 
are you that the- the- the 
other mobile net will not, uh, take advantage of this? inaudible. inaudible. 
This is uh, the purpose of the data center is for the global inaudible and 
for the internal uh, inaudible much more than 20% inaudible uh, X amount of profit. And the intention of 
this inaudible 
is uh, one of the parts of the data center ecosystem on inaudible mostly on the global place 
inaudible. Thank 
you. Thanks. inaudible. inaudible. So uh, two questions. Is the price hike inaudible end of uh, Q1, it's not so much a formal price hike, but it was absorbed from inaudible 
for the half a year. 
And it was only once inaudible. It wasn't nationwide. 
inaudible progressively since the end of Q1 
and inaudible from the price hike it wasn't really just increasing the 
inaudible, it was more of a inaudible the prices inaudible more competitive or more valuable customers, but we 

try to keep an eye on the things they are asking inaudible and 

hopefully will grow. 
So, this is how we did that. inaudible basically our inaudible customer base. 
We have also been using um, I think a new model inaudible recommending. So inaudible for customers. 
The customers who are more uh, inaudible same kind of concept with them. 
inaudible even more and higher volume and higher payouts we offer them inaudible. So, inaudible. So, the 
business uh, type of inaudible for customers from all different kinds of uh, inaudible for them. inaudible hope that the competition 
can also correct the pricing, um, inaudible and we hope this will continue in the- in the future inaudible overall. Yeah, thank you. Thank 
you. Once again, just a reminder if wish to 
ask a 
question please press star one on the telephone. 
We have a follow up question from line of inaudible, okay. 
Please go ahead. inaudible. Um, two questions please if I may. Um, inaudible in the home um, the inaudible. Uh, could 
you inaudible um, how's um, are you thinking about the inaudible outlook and subscriber inaudible. Uh, secondly 
on your inaudible you have um, inaudible, but can you 
also share some tangible benefits inaudible like subscribility and inaudible or any kind of tangible 
uh, benefits would be uh, inaudible. inaudible. 
For the second question inaudible. But more 
importantly our recommendations is inaudible. 
Yeah, yeah. But um… 
Okay. Yeah. Thanks. inaudible in the- in the- inaudible the- the inaudible. And also, we inaudible. And also 
we

Got it. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Once again, 
if you wish to ask a question please press star one 
on your telephone. The next question comes from the line of inaudible. Please go ahead. Hi thank you. Uh, 
I just have two questions. Uh, first question, can you inaudible on the um, ideal plan for uh 
inaudible and uh, second question on inaudible uh, inaudible I missed the- your response earlier on the question about 
uh, current outlook for inaudible subscribers uh, going into this year and next year. Thank you. 
I think on the inaudible, uh, inaudible from 
the ICO, uh, today and uh, one 
of the inaudible uh, inaudible November. So, inaudible in November. 
So, that's uh, in our plan. 
Currently we are uh, in the process of inaudible and other activities related to the ICO project itself. 
inaudible you want to answer inaudible what is the inaudible. Okay, uh, inaudible. 
For the second inaudible Q1 inaudible customer uh, inaudible. Uh, but other than that inaudible uh, uh, because inaudible the pandemic 
inaudible uh, inaudible because uh, uh, inaudible. So, uh, we 
look uh, to be more proactive to make sure that we can inaudible because inaudible the customer and to offer the uh, inaudible customer uh, uh, inaudible. I think both inaudible answer on this one. 
In terms of the demand inaudible the next two years. Uh, from the, I think uh, inaudible right now it is uh, really hard inaudible because of the COVID situation and so on. 
And inaudible price uh, increase the quality of our customer by inaudible at least one million inaudible quality. 
For this uh, I think, uh, inaudible the price increase, uh, I think inaudible. Uh, this uh, 
already bring us to the uh, inaudible in this year uh, while uh, financially inaudible. Part is, 
I think, uh, about the situation of inaudible. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
We have a follow up from uh, inaudible from inaudible. Please go ahead. Yes, uh, thanks very much. So, um, 
I wanted to inaudible uh, about- about uh, the profit from the inaudible from uh, 
the farming. Uh, when- when this will- when this will be finalized and uh, you expect to uh, inaudible uh, 
this uh, 
this frequency. Uh, inaudible megahertz uh, and uh, 
may- may I ask uh, uh, uh, the, on the guide, it's a bit open for uh, 
interpretation. Uh, it- it's about 25% of uh, of- of your revenue, 
uh, ex- excluding uh, 5G uh, 
uh, inaudible how, what- what does this uh, actually mean? I mean, uh, uh, inaudible are also going 
to be used for- for 5G. This is my understanding. Uh, uh, how- how 
inaudible statement and the guidance. Thank you. inaudible your question. I think some of the progress for the department inaudible. 
So, typically inaudible is 25%, including the inaudible. Uh, for the, 
I think the, that's for the outlook. 
Because the 5G inaudible will remain still inaudible the 5G. Right, thanks. 
So, uh, just to uh, follow up. 
That inaudible um, 
maybe 5G better than the uh, more uh, uh, more intensified maybe, uh, going forward, maybe- maybe next year 
and 
that uh, that topic- Yeah, and that, uh, that capex sales inaudible and, and, in, uh, on, may, may have to increase there, uh, there in the following years. 
inaudible we have to wait until it's inaudible when inaudible went fast. inaudible countries with the inaudible sector of. And inaudible that point, um, inaudible, 
uh, inaudible 
Right, right. Thanks. But maybe I can speak one, one inaudible. Uh, 
with regards to, uh, inaudible, uh, 
does, it, it's still inaudible uh, planning to transfer more assets to, uh, to inaudible in the, in the inaudible future. 
And yeah, thank you. 
Uh, thank you, inaudible. 
And, uh, transfer of the inaudible, uh, let me inaudible in the inaudible I think inaudible and the business there is, 
uh, inaudible, uh, inaudible. 
And then, uh, inaudible we are in the process of, 
uh, finalizing the transfer of 4000, uh, towers. So inaudible, uh, 
inaudible but I think, uh, how much is, uh, going inaudible that we have in the market, uh, supposed to be inaudible on 
that one. So, uh, inaudible basically, uh, uh, I 
think, uh, inaudible. We'll see what happens. inaudible on the what is, uh, 
inaudible. But, uh, if it's, uh, inaudible in the plans of the company 
inaudible Oh, oh, okay, so, uh, this new, um, uh, uh, inaudible, uh, this, this is 4000 inaudible dollars, uh, in addition to the, uh, uh, 6000 inaudible in the, in the past, right? 
Yes, yes. This is inaudible also have around, uh, inaudible we supposed to have around inaudible, uh, inaudible tower after this added to 
now, 4000. Right. And, and, uh, you, you listened to inaudible $1000 from, uh, from telecom, or is it from, uh, inaudible 
sales? Uh, we have our 
inaudible uh, in brand inaudible a pair of towers from cellphones to make our cell. Uh, this is not include in the 10,000 that inaudible Okay, okay. 
And what is the inaudible rate on this, uh, 4000 towers? 
Uh, I think, uh, we have to inaudible but the situation right now, I think the inaudible around 1.26 inaudible, yeah. Uh, 1.7, uh… 
inaudible 5-7, oh sorry. 
1, uh, .57. Uh, this tower, uh, is inaudible uh, inaudible 3% of the tower. 
And inaudible, uh, inaudible and the rest in the outside of the inaudible. Of course, 
I think, uh, inaudible uh, quite a, a significant, uh, potential in case of inaudible Right, right. 
Uh, thank you so much, inaudible. 
Thank you for your, uh, feedback. Thank you. 
The next question comes from the line of inaudible from Alliance inaudible. Please go ahead. 
Sorry, Alex, and, uh, thank you for the opportunity. Uh, three questions here.

on, uh, the inaudible around, uh, dividend policies, if you have any? Uh, understanding that 
inaudible might need, uh, coming back inaudible stocks on, on a dividend's base. 
Thank you. 
Okay. I think 
inaudible, uh, basically we, uh, inaudible the, uh, the reason why inaudible and, uh, in the market for the investment, uh, that you guys make on us inaudible. Uh, but

Um, are you guys have more, like, um, more inaudible bank, where you, um, you will eventually, um, exit? 
Or is this, 
um, more of a… 'Cause I noticed most of the investees are part of your verticals as well, 
um, or do you guys plan to be a long-term, uh, investors for your portfolio companies? Thank you. 
Well, uh, it's inaudible in a, inaudible but, uh, just want to, to understand that inaudible 
we're not going to be like a compa- a, inaudible the impact, and, and mostly inaudible 
What we do with inaudible is, is it's good side. One is the first, uh, we are, you know, inaudible but, 
uh, similarly the other, uh, 
looking at what is the important so inaudible with the inaudible can be related with a member of the company inaudible complete inaudible 
the others. And so, so I think, 
uh, we inaudible too bad inaudible. And, and, 
uh, for the, uh, I think that inaudible 
is, is the inaudible because inaudible that can inaudible in be our, has a inaudible 
and inaudible in that. Maybe 
just a quick follow-up: I understand you 
establishing a, a long-term relationship, uh, 
with inaudible importance, but, um, you know, in the inaudible exit inaudible, you know, 20%, 30%, um, inaudible 20%, 30%, but 
holding a stake in the company a necessary step to, uh, cement that relationship? 
Or, uh, you know, once you've been working with them for a while and you do them in the beginning, or is that sufficient by itself? 
Well, the, one, uh, I think 
we are inaudible is, is, is, like I said, is also what kind of, uh, inaudible. It's, 
it's, uh, quite promising, and then, uh, it's a, we believe it's, it's a coming that is good for us, and inaudible now we can do, 
uh, as promised, as, as we cannot, uh. So, 
so, so I think that is, that is, that's real. We, we do the investment 
and, and, and, uh, and, uh, yeah. Okay. Uh, thank you. Thank you very much. 
Uh, so my last question is on the, uh, the inaudible seg- segment, the telecom segment overall. 
Um, I noticed that inaudible markets now very close now to, uh, 50%, uh, consider that scale is now play out very nicely. Um, 
I noticed that if I take the whole, take the whole segment you have inaudible margins 25, 20 segment, 
20s, inaudible so that means that inaudible salary mostly, if not higher. 
Um, would, would you be able to give us some guidance on, you know, if over the long term, between inaudible and, and enterprise and 
wholesale, which is probably the most inaudible towers and inaudible, 
what kind of EBITDA margin or what kinds of margins generally are we looking for, for each subsegment? Thank you. 
Uh, thank you for the question. I think, uh, probably inaudible answers. But, uh, I think overall, uh, we inaudible market right now. 
If you see in the home we have, uh, inaudible margin 
there. Uh, you asked whether we can inaudible increase the margin. Uh, the margin right now that we have, uh, of course from the 
inaudible that we have, and then they also buy on, I think, inaudible I think that's the, uh, profile on that one. So, uh, inaudible to balance is in the inaudible margin and inaudible also the long-term inaudible, 
uh, uh, system of inaudible of our 
home business marketing, more, I think, inaudible, uh, uh, inaudible customers here. 
I think, uh, with the margin that we have, 
we are very happy with this. We try to, uh, inaudible, uh, and inaudible by helping more customer in more cities. 
Uh, inaudible with this, uh, hopefully it's all, uh, inaudible well. inaudible we can have a better market inaudible and better opportunity at this, I'd 
say. What happened is you get, uh, more money by growing the inaudible of the business with the thin margin inaudible. And then, uh, in inaudible 
and, uh, uh, inaudible enterprise, uh, we have about a, a inaudible margin about inaudible. 
So we, uh, noticed inaudible related to help inaudible that we have 
inaudible built, and so on. We inaudible enter into inaudible by helping inaudible, uh, I think, 
uh, inaudible on this one. So, uh, in the long run if inaudible, uh, try to, uh, inaudible get, uh, margin. 
In the power business, uh, of course, inaudible understood, there inaudible have to have, I think, uh, quite inaudible. 
I think that the direction that we have 
addressed without, uh, I think, uh, from inaudible we do have a, I think, a quite a good margin. Uh, and inaudible of the inaudible 
of a better inaudible Okay, uh, thank you. So maybe just a follow-up, uh, on a long-term basis, and you know, as a five-year basis, 
uh, would it be fair to say that the fixed segments EBITDA margin is probably 35%, 40%, uh, once 
you mix 
the scales and the tower business inaudible? Or if, would it be more similar to the way we have right now, 
uh, around this inaudible Hmm. 
I think, um, uh, we do support inaudible 
but more than inaudible earlier, as in, uh, we know that, uh, in the, uh, 
I think we're in the home, uh, inaudible have more inaudible, um, than the front. 
We make our inaudible, uh, I think depend our market, and so on, this month. Uh, 
I think, uh, inaudible earning proof but, uh, I think more than worth. 
Okay, uh, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
If there are no further questions, I would like to end the call back inaudible at inaudible please go ahead. inaudible thank you everyone for participating in, uh, to this call. We apologize for those present who have not yet inaudible their account. That inaudible. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
