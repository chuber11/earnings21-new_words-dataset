With that I'd like to hand the call over to Paul. 
Well, thank you Ava and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Delighted to be here and together with the members of the Executive Team to take you through the updates on our business and financial performance. 
You may have noticed that the visual change to our materials is more clear, it's more modern. 
I want to emphasize that it's part of the transformation soon to be knocking us off the table, including how parts of the business are named or indeed presented. 
Going forward, we'll be known as Sanofi across our businesses and we continue to work to raise the standards of disease treatment and prevention. 
Let's start with the full year view. We deliver a 7.1% sales growth this year compared to a 3.3% last year. 
Dupixent grew across all geographies and vaccines delivered another year of record influence to business with €2.6 billion in sales. 
The contribution of our other GDUs has also been critical. 
The core assets we prioritized in our general medicine business grew 5.6%, now amounting to €5.8 billion together. 
And our consumer health business is catching up fast to close the gap with market growth. 
Bottom line, we delivered an EPS of €6.56, growing at 15.5% and continuing the strong trends we set since 2019. 
We have inaudible improved our profitability with a BOI that now stands at 28.6 at CER. 
This is proven by both improved gross profitability given the growing specialty care and GenMed core asset portfolios as well as our discipline in spending. 
At the same time, the way we set our financial targets allows us to keep adding to our early-stage pipeline. I'll talk a little more about that in a few minutes. 
Moving to slide seven, let me turn to our main transformation activities this year. 
We announced six bolt-on acquisitions which strengthen our growth areas in immunology, oncology and vaccines. 
They're a perfect fit with our strategic priorities as outlined on Capital Market's Day in December 2019. 
We stay on the lookout for exciting business development opportunities. For example, our collaboration with BIOND which adds a new generation checkpoint inhibitor to our clinical pipeline. 
We also intend to unlock the potential of digital, data and artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development. 
This is the rationale behind our partnerships with Owkin and Accenture, to help us future accelerate our efforts in immunology and oncology. 
As we focus our efforts on building a sustainable pipeline, we're also taking action to reduce our complexity, again fully in line with our 2019 commitments. 
We've continued to diverse brands from our established portfolio and moved more than 50 countries to a distributor model. 
The stand-alone model for consumer health is about 80% complete and we started an ambitious program to reduce the number of consumer healthcare brands. 
The next major milestone for us this year will be the planned IPO of EUROAPI, which could create the second biggest API player in the world. 
Now let's move to what is at the core of our Play to Win strategy, developing breakthrough medicines and vaccines to improve peoples lives. 
Let me give you a few highlights of what has been achieved over the past 12 months to advance our priority assets and beat, beat in the few benchmarks in R&D productivity. 
We delivered seven positive pivotal read-outs last year, 
this further marks a major scientific advancement in our effort to provide protection against RSV for all infants. 
We're about to begin global submissions one year ahead of our initial plan and we're getting ready to launch for the 2023 RSV season. 
Dupixent has only begun to penetrate the large type 2 patient population and atopic derm and asthma. 
Last year, four additional indications delivered positive results. 
The year was also marked by eight major approvals for Dupixent, Libtayo and Sarclisa 
as well as Nexviazyme in Pompe Disease which strengthens our Rare Disease franchise. 
Our R&D engine achieved a remarkable milestone this year, 
with 10 molecules entering the clinical pipeline from in-house research. It's something we have never achieved in the past. 
Our focus on three key therapeutic areas; immunology, oncology and neurology is increasing. 
We're building an inaudible immunology pipeline and have put our OX40 ligand antibody Amlitelimab on the list of our priority assets, 
which allocates additional funding to allow accelerated development of the program. 
A potential first-in-class and best-in-class treatment for a range of immune mediated diseases, starting with atopic dermatitis. 
Rilzabrutinib is in Phase 2 development as a potential oral treatment option, inaudible asthma and CSU are going to be open soon. 
Oncology keeps building with the amcenestrant first line study, AMEERA-5 already fully recruited. 
Significantly earlier than planned, given the high interest in the study from the investigated community. 
In addition, we entered broad Phase 2 programs for our engineered best-in-class in inaudible SAR'245 and 
our first-in-class CEACAM5 antibody drug conjugate to explore and accelerate the development in areas of high unmet need. 
In neurology, our scientists are continuing to build qa body of data showing the impact of Tolebrutinib on human microglia, 
which supports some pieces that this brain penetrable molecule modulates neuroinflammatory processes directly within the central nervous system. 
We will share new and important data inaudible just coming up shortly. 
We also have started Phase 3 developments of Tolebrutinib for the treatment of Myasthenia gravis, 
a chronic progressive neuromuscular disease that strikes more than 10,000 people each year in the US alone. 
Advancing to slide nine, I want to highlight how we are strengthening the early stages of our early pipeline by adding 36 projects in one year. 
This speaks volumes about our commitment to build an industry-leading sustainable pipeline with a steady stream of new assets that can transform the practice of medicine. 
2021 has also marked the creation of our mRNA Center of Excellence, to accelerate the development of the next generation of vaccines 
With the ambition to deliver a minimum of six clinical candidates by 2025. 
We shared with you the interim results of our first mRNA monovalent flu study and pivoted our platform to modified mRNA in record time. 
As we transform and modernize the company for the long-term, the teams also keep delivering robust performance and creating value in the short-term. 
Our Q4 program is a good reflection of this. In fact, this quarter marks the first time that the Specialty Care business has led our business units by sales. 
The growth drive of Specialty Care with Dupixent 
53% up compared to the same quarter last year and our Specialty Care pipeline has grown to 87 projects in Phase 1 to 3 with 61 
in our key therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology and neurology. 
So, with that, let's start the Specialty Care and Bill over to you. 
Thank you Paul. It is indeed a very exciting milestone for Specialty Care to emerge as the largest business unit of Sanofi by sales in the last quarter. 
This milestone validates our commitment to execute on our business priorities and to be a leader in innovative medicines that change patient's lives. 
The fourth quarter proved to be another remarkale period of growth for our Specialty Care franchises with €3.5 billion in sales, up 21.3%. 
As mentioned by Paul earlier, Dupixent, our truly transformative immunology mega-brand, delivered once again a stellar quarter with more than €1.5 billion of sales 
and higher double digit, and high double digit growth across all regions. 
More about the brand performance in just a minute. 
Double digit growth of our oncology franchise in the quarter and for the full year was mainly driven by the continued launch execution of Sarclisa and Libtayo in their respective key markets. 
Looking ahead, we are on a trajectory to exceed €1 billion in sales in oncology this year 
despite the continued decline of Jevtana due to generic competition for the product in Europe. 
Our Rare Disease business recorded exceptionally strong fourth quarter sales up 9.5%, 
driven primarily by higher demand across the Pompe, Gaucher and Fabry franchises. 
Notably, our Pompe franchise reached blockbuster status in 2021, totalling more than €1 billion in global sales. 
We are making great progress in the US uptake of Nexviazyme, our recently launched next-generation ERT for Pompe Disease. 
We are actively working on establishing Nexviazyme as the next standard of care in global markets. 
We obtained marketing approval in Japan in November and have launched there. 
In addition, we look forward to a number of potential approvals in 2022 and continue to work toward approval in Europe from the EMA. 
Rare Blood Disorders franchise sales grew 2.7% when excluding lower industrial sales facility. 
Growth of the franchise in the fourth quarter was driven by Cablivi, mainly due to additional launches in Europe and higher Alprolix in the US. 
High fourth quarter sales of immunology and neurology were due to the performance of Kevzara, which grew mainly because of the continued global demand for IL-6 receptor blockers and a temporary shortage of a competitor product, Tocilizumab. 
As a result, we expect the demand for Kevzara, which is indicated for patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, to remain strong in the coming months. 
Strong growth of Kevzara was partially out stepped by anticipated sales declines of Aubagio and inaudible in the quarter. 
Now moving to slide 13. 
Dupixent delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2021, driven by consistent strong growth quarter after quarter in US and ex-US markets. 
Last year alone, Dupixent added €1.7 billion of incremental sales to the top line, making it Sanofi's number one growth driver. 
Annualizing now at more than €6 billion in sales we continue to believe that we are just at the beginning of the journey for this mega-brand. 
Over the last two years, the key contributors to consistent strong growth have been patient demand, the approval of new indications and the expansion into younger patient populations. 
I'd like to remind you that 2 -42-1 growth is commonly impacted in the US due to patients inaudible reset. 
However, consistent strong underlying demand quarter over quarter has resulted in Dupixent becoming the number one newly prescribed biologic among, among each specialist we call on, including dermatologists, allergists, pulmonologists and ENTs. 
Outside the US, China continues to represent a major growth opportunity. 
With more than 30,000 adult patients treated to date, the launch is progressing strongly and according to our plans. 
Dupixent growth opportunity in China is bolstered by the early NRDL listing, 
which was just extended by the authorities in China to include the 200mg dose, improving our access to the adolescent patient population. 
In atopic dermatitis specifically, we have been rapidly advancing our leadership as new entrants come to the market in the US, Europe and Japan. 
We believe competition can further raise awareness and help unlock our full market potential in AD. 
Recent US approval of competitive AD treatment options have come with a significant delay and in some cases, safety concerns which are reflected in their label. 
In line with our expectations, some new entrants have restricted indications as second line systemic therapies which can mean use after Dupixent. 
We believe this further reinforces Dupixent's best-in-disease clinical profile, balancing rapid and sustained efficacy with proven long-term efficacy. 
This strengthens our position as first line therapy in the growing AD market. 
At the same time, we remain focused on delivering milestones for future growth, 
including the regulatory submissions of AD in children younger than six years old and in eosinophilic esophagitis. 
In Asthma, we received a positive CHMP opinion for Dupixent in patients as young as six years old, with a final decision expected by the European Commission in the coming months. 
We're also excited by the recent pivotal data read-out in prurigo nodularis which I will discuss briefly on my next slide. 
On slide 14, the data points on the chart demonstrates impressively the consistent benefits Dupixent has shown across two Phase 3 trials, PRIME and PRIME 2. 
These data confirms significant improvements in itch and the appearance of skin lesions in patients who are inadequately controlled with topical therapies 
or for whom those were not advisable. 
The pivotal data read-out is also confirming the potential benefit of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 as 
the central drivers of Type 2 inflammation in this specific disease, 
adding yet another indication for Dupixent if approved. 
Importantly, data from the PRIME and PRIME 2 studies were consistent with the well-established safety profile of Dupixent in already approved indications. 
We are very excited about the opportunity in prurigo nodularis, given the high unmet need and lack of approved systemic therapies. 
We are on track to begin submissions to regulatory agencies in the first half of this year. 
Moving to slide 15, I'd like to highlight two of our launch opportunities in 2022. 
Both new product exemplify our commitment to bring innovative treatments to the market in Specialty Care, addressing underserved and sometimes under- uh, 
ultra rare diseases where there are few or no approved treatment options available. 
On the left side of the slide, we are eagerly expecting the FDA approval of Sutimlimab with the inaudible date tomorrow, February 5th. 
Sutimlimab has been developed as the first treatment for cold agglutinin or CAD, 
and our plan is to begin launching in the US through our existing Rare Blood Disorders business operations. 
A roll out of launches is planned for Japan later this year and in key European markets beginning in 2023. 
On the right side of the slide, the upcoming launch of Olipudase alfa, underscores our unwavering commitment to delivering innovative therapies for the rare disease patient community. 
Once approved, Olipudase will be the first and only therapy for pediatric and adult patients living with non- CNS manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase deficiency or ASMD, a rare disease that robs quality of life for patients and their families and also increases the risk of premature death. 
The clinical development program for Olipudase has demonstrated positive results in two separate clinical trials, 
in adult and pediatric patients. 
Data from the ASCEND and Phase 2 ASCEND-T trial evaluating Olipudase alfa served as the basis for regulatory filings. 
Turning to slide 16. 
Efa, our uniquely engineered Factor VIII has the potential to revolutionize factor treatment for Hemophilia A patients, 
pending successful completion of our ongoing Phase 3 trial. 
Efa is designed to maintain high factor levels for much longer than all currently marketed factor replacement therapies. 
The product profile aims at providing sustained protection at near normal factor levels for most of the week, helping patients enjoy normal levels of physical activity. 
Couple with a low treatment burden of a once weekly dose. 
Considering the winning combination of convenience with weekly dosing, therapeutic activity with unmatched factor levels and a safety profile in line with other factor therapies, 
Efa has the potential to become the factor therapy of choice, 
significantly improving quality of life for Hemophilia A patients. 
With the potential to capture a significant share of the global $5 billion factor class market, 
we see high commercial opportunity for Sanofi territories US and Japan, addressing patients already on factor therapy and expect a rapid uptake once approved. 
We also believe that Efa's profile would be competitive against non-factor treatments, unlocking additional opportunities by converting a portion of the non-factor patient population to safe factor treatment. 
While we are still waiting to see the Phase 3 data, we are looking to sharing the pivotal results with you which we expect at the end of Q1. 
With that, I hand over to Thomas to update you on the Vaccines business. 
Thank you Bill. Two full inaudible in vaccines generated significant sales of €2 billion, including 
the strong increasing Flu sales in Europe as well as gross reporting by PPH and Travel franchises. 
The lower GBU sales last year were mainly due to the US influence on market where two factors combined. 
First, the immunization rate due to the priority given to COVID-19 vaccination in November and December. 
And second, the record inaudible in the third quarter leading 55% / 45% split for the Q3/Q4 period. 
The US performance was partially offset by the strong Q4 demand in other geographies. Especially Europe, where Efluelda was very successfully launched. 
The PPH franchise recovered with a strong fourth quarter growth despite lower growth rate around the world. Mostly driven by Pentaxim performance in China. 
Finally, we are also pleased to see some recovery of the Travel franchise even though we are still far from the pre-pandemic level. 
Last note, 
on inaudible despite the pandemic environment, all five Vaccine franchises have demonstrated growth in 2021 compared to 2020, 
illustrating again the robustness of our Vaccines business. Next slide please. 
On the next slide, let's look at our record Flu performance in 2021, with a 6% growth over last years record. 
On the left chart, you can see that the impact from the US market contraction was more than compensated by the strong performance of Europe and rest of the world. 
Let me be very clear, the US sales reduction has nothing to do with our product's performance. 
COVID-19 was still given the priority by retailers and inaudible providers and as a result, 
the total number of US injected this season differed by 17%. 
Despite that challenging environment, Flu continued to expand market share and gained 3.5 share in the senior segment in the US. 
In Europe, the strongest Flu inaudible in Germany enabled us to reach the spectacular 64% growth following the positive inaudible recommendation. 
And the last to report, that for the first season three out of four German senior citizens have been affected from Influenza inaudible. 
The right graph shows the continuous progress of our Flu franchise. All incremental sales in 2021 were driven by our differentiated Flu vaccines. 
Thanks to their proven ability to protect against cardiovascular events and against immuno-hospitalization. 
For the first time ever, our differentiated Flu sales represented the majority of annual sales, 
indicating that the importance of providing protection beyond Flu resonates well with the common stakeholders. 
I'm confident that our Flu franchise will continue to grow in 2022 and that this year we'll see another record year. With that I hand over to Oliver. 
Thank you Thomas. Moving to General Medicine on Slide 19, we are anchored by our performance in the fourth quarter. 
The execution of our strategy continues to deliver as planned and the focus on our core assets has consistently generated positive results in recent quarters. 
In the fourth quarter, General Medicine sales with €3.4 billion, which included sales from industrial sales. 
Our core assets grew 2.1% and we're up as much as 4% when excluding the affect of inaudible sales regional in the US, 
which ended at the end of 2020. 
We drove double digit growth for both Multaq and Soliqua in the quarter 
while target growths of 7.5% was accelerated by the trump performance in China, 
where the product is already included in the Volume-Based Procurement program for the second year. And generated growth of 28% in the inaudible, 
we are very happy about the performance. 

in 
Germany. 
As highlighted during the previous earnings calls, Lovenox sales were slightly down. 
This is mainly due to the high base for comparison in the first quarter of 2020, 
which followed the introduction of the WHO guidelines for the treatments of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 
as well as some supply limitations. 
Our leading transplant franchise was strengthened by the consolidation of our new product addition, Rezurock. 
Starting on November 9th, Rezurock added 20 million euros of sales in the quarter. 
I will provide more detail on this exciting launch on my next slide. 
In China, Sanofi participated in the VB program for insulin in November. 
We are very proud of the results in the balance of our insulin category with Lantus and Toujeo. 
Sanofi was the only multinational company among the winners in Category A, 
which is a product category that will receive most of the hospital volume allocations. 
Our glargine franchise remained broadly stable in the quarter, supported by Toujeo, and despite the price and inventory adjustments in China, in anticipation of the implementation of the insulin DVT, which is expected in the first half of 2022. 
Sales of non-core assets were lower in the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
The decline of 7.6% 
reflected the impact of product divestiture, which are key to our ongoing strategic streamlining efforts. 
We are vigorously reducing the number of small product families, with the objective to drive efficiencies and increase profitability. 
Moving now to Slide 20. For the full year 2021, general medicine sales reached 14.2 billion euros, which included sales from industrial affairs, totaling 808 million euros. 
Importantly, our core assets were up 5.6%. 
This performance translates into growth of 7.6% when excluding the impact of Praluent sales to Regeneron in the US. 
Across our brands, Lovenox, Praluent, when excluding US sales, Soliqua, and our established brand in the transplant business, 
Thymoglobulin and Mozobil, delivered double-digit growth in 2021. 
The performance of our core assets in 2021 
reinforce our confidence to deliver on our ambition to grow our core asset mid-single-digit CAGR over the period of 2020- 2025. 
For 2022, we expect another year of strong performance of our core assets. 
Despite the high base of comparison in 2021 for Lovenox, we expect sales of Lovenox in 2022 to be close to the level of 2021. 
Our well-established transplant franchise is expected to continue the growth path, strengthened by the launch execution in Rezurock. 
Soliqua is also set to continue its growth trajectory, supported by differentiated clinical profile. 
Leveraging the compelling SoliMix data, Soliqua is well poised for the competition with premixed insulin in its key markets. 
We are also very excited by the anticipated approval of Soliqua in China later this year. 
In China, the winning position of our basal insulin products, Lantus and Toujeo, in Category A of DVT 
will enable us to deliver significantly higher volumes but at lower price. 
With the pricing effect in mind, we expect our total glargine sales, Toujeo and Lantus, 
to decrease by around 30, three-zero percent, in 2022 in China. 
Looking ahead, we aim to establish Toujeo as a basal insulin of choice in the large diabetic market in China 
and expect to make Toujeo an important growth driver for our business in China in 2022 and beyond. 
Our non-core asset performance in 2021 reflects the impact from the progress we are making with our portfolio streamlining efforts. 
As discussed earlier, we continue to reduce the number of nonstrategic tail product families. 
In summary, our 2021 achievements give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitment to stabilize sales by 2025, as compared to the 2020 base, and to maintain general medicine BOI margin accretive for the group over the 2020-2025 period. 
Now, moving to Kadmon on slide two, 21. Let's discuss the value proposition of this important transaction for Sanofi and our transplant business. 
The acquisition was completed in November and represents a strong fit with our strategy. 
Kadmon's key asset was approved in the US last summer and receiving positive market feedback as highlighted on the slide. 
Rezurock has already reached 96% penetration in 80 key centers, and more than 500 patients have been treated to date. 
As we shared on our last earnings calls, Rezurock is a first-in-class treatment for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older, with chronic graft-versus-host disease 
who have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. 
The prevalence is roughly 14,000 patients in the US, with steroid being the current standard of care 
in frontline cGVHD treatment. 
We estimate that 5,000 to 7,000 patients in the US who are treated with steroids fail in their therapy and then require additional treatment. 
In the slightly more than four months in the US launch, Rezurock generated sales of 44 million euros, 
of which 20 millions were consolidated by Sanofi since the acquisition. 
Going forward, we plan on accelerating the geographic expansion. 
We will continue to leverage our transplant expertise to maximize Rezurock's growth potential, capitalizing on our longstanding relationship with the transplant community. 
In conclusion, we are excited about this innovative new core asset for Sanofi and confirm that the Kadmon acquisition will be slightly accretive in 2022. 
With that, I hand over the call to Julie. 
Thank you, Olivier. It's been a year since we presented our strategic priorities, with the goal to grow our priority brands above market growth as early as 2022 in key geographies. 
I'm glad to, to report that today, we're ahead of that commitment. Indeed, in 2020, we were losing share and we were trending about five points below market growth. 
The latest market data shows that we have closed this gap. 
In November, on a rolling 12 months, we are at par with market growth. This despite our absence in cough and cold and physical wellness categories in the US 
and mainly driven by our priority categories in key geographies gaining share. 
These results show that the execution of our three strategic priorities to drive our business is starting to pay off. 
On our first priority of cutting and embracing complexity, we've been able to increasingly focus on our key brands and geographies. Thanks to our simplification efforts, 
we have divested and pruned 111 non-core brands, a reduction of 40% of our total number of brands, 
which represents less than a point and a half of our sales. 
We've also reduced our trademarks by 50%, our domain names by 30%, and are continuously working on simplifying our processes and ways of working. 
At the same time, we have embraced the complexity of our multi-local brands by reallocating investments to brands with the biggest growth potential in market ger- share, market share gain. 
On our second strategic priority, to become a true, fast-moving consumer healthcare business, the 
creation of our standalone is a key enabler. And we're on track. 
80% of our legal entities are now live and we integrated key functions like industrial affairs, all science-related functions, and supply chain under one roof. 
The success of this is twofold. First, a significant increase in agility, in reaction to market, and consumer needs. 
Cough and cold is a good example, where we were able to quickly seize the opportunity of the market rebound in Q4, resulting in market share gain in October and November, excluding China. 
This is a first in four years. 
In addition, as mentioned earlier, this helps us to revisit our ways of working and adapt them to, to the specificities of a fast-moving consumer healthcare business, for 
example, in consumer engagement, digital market, marketing or speed of innovation. 
A big focus has also been to strengthen our brand equities and campaigns, beyond the pure science and quality of our products, which we already deliver. 
On our third priority to build our digital and data edge, 
the creation of our standalone here again has given us the opportunity to revisit and build fundamentals with a strong focus on e-commerce, brand sites, CHC-specific CRM, and third-party management systems, and data-driven A&P innovation tools. 
Regarding our Rx-to- OTC switches, both programs continue to progress despite the pandemic. 
The team is actively working on the projects, and we continue to execute critical studies in accelerated fashion. 
For Cialis in the US, we have completed the self-selection studies, and results have been submitted to FDA, along with the protocol for an actual use trial. 
No erectile dysfunction, Rx-to- OTC switch project has gone this far. 
We are now waiting for the FDA feedback in order to proceed. 
For Tamiflu, we're evaluating the status of the current flu season to determine if certain studies can progress. 
In the meantime, we have accelerated all studies that can be done without the presence of disease to keep the pace. 
On both programs, we should be able to share more next quarter. 
Turning to page 23, when looking at net sales performance, we have delivered 5.6% growth in Q4. 
Our organic growth is even higher with 7% growth in Q4 when excluding the impact of divestments. 
These results are driven by three factors. 
First, the progress we've made on the execution of our strategic priorities, as mentioned earlier. 
Secondly, we benefited from the market rebound in categories like cough and cold. And lastly, we also benefited from COVID vaccinations, specifically in pain care. 
We will continue to focus our efforts to further delivering our three strategic priorities 
that have proven to be working, with the ambition to build a true, fast-moving consumer healthcare business and be at par with the market. 
Let me wrap up by saying how much I am enjoying working with the team, driving the CHC business back to growth. With that, I hand it over to our CFO, Jean-Baptiste. Thank you, Judy. 
Let me start by highlighting some strong proof points for Sanofi confirmation in 2021. 
First, we managed to increase full year gross margin by 120 bps to 71.3%. 
This improvement is linked to the growing sales contribution of our brands in specialty care on higher-margin vaccine products. 
It is also the result of efficiency measures in manufacturing, which typically require a longer lead time before they become accretive to margin and are now starting to come through. 
As I've said before, we are committed to continuing this trend of gross margin improvement. 
So then, we managed our OpEx in 2021 effectively and without disrupting the strong growth momentum. 
We successfully controlled the increase in OpEx on managing them to grow slower than sales, which was possible as a result of our rigorous prioritization. 
As before, we reinvested the vast majority of efficiencies generated during the year. 
Finally, let me briefly comment on another proof point of our transformation, head, headcount. When I took on the CFO role in 2018, the company employed around 105,000 employees worldwide. 
With the ongoing transformation towards a more agile organization, we are now in a new phase with approximately 96,000 globally, 
while we continue to change our ways of working. 
We are embracing digital change, streamlining our portfolio, and collaborating with partners and geographies to balance or reduce infrastructure, while improving access to our medicines. 
On this path, we expect to end the year with a headcount closer to 90, 000, reflecting a more efficient organization. 
This would represent the 15%, one-five, lower headcount as compared to 2018, and would include the successful IPO of EUROAPI on the existing plan. 
On slide 26, turning now to the full P&L for the fourth quarter, company sales increased 4.1% at CER, 
driven by excellent growth of Dupixent, and other specialty care franchise, as well as consumer health. 
Business operating income grew 6.9% at CER, 
benefiting from improvements at gross margin level, which were driven by the favorable portfolio shift to specialty care products and efficiencies within industrial affairs. 
In the fourth quarter, we again saw an increase compared to last year, with the margin improving 240 basis points. 
Business EPS grew 9.8% at CER, benefiting from a slightly lower tax rate of 20.5. 
Turning to Slide 27. 
We have achieved around 2.4 billion of cumulative savings, of which 2.1 were accrued through OpEx efficiencies, as depicted by the bright purple boxes shown on this slide. 
In addition, we realized an incremental 300 million in COGS reductions over the last two years. 
Specifically, we achieved our target of 500 million savings in R&D due to prioritization of specialty care on exiting diabetes and cardiovascular. 
In addition, lasting efficiencies were generated by consolidating function across sites, improving our trials logistic, 
reducing cycle times through advances in data and digital, coupled with more agile governance. 
Gen med has been successful in reducing the complexity of its business, focusing on key markets, on employing a digitally enabled go-to-market model. 
G&A across all areas of Sanofi contributed 500 million of savings over the last two years, driven by smart spending initiatives, 
real estate efficiencies, a preferred supplier model on digitalization. 
In summary, we remain on track to achieve our target of 2.5 billion savings by end of 2022. 
Most of this year's savings are again earmarked to be reallocated to fund our growth drivers and key programs in R&D. 
Moving to Slide 28. Let 
me briefly comment on our strongly increased free cash flow. In fact, we doubled free cash flow since 2018, so we focus on improved business performance and change in working capital. 
Given the strong improvement in free cash flow in recent years, 
we were able to achieve our 2019 capital markets day objective of a free cash flow increase of around 50%, one year ahead of schedule. 
On slide 29, 
we maintain our objective to continue Sanofi's annual dividend policy, which is reflected in the fact that the company has consistently increased its dividend payments for the past 27 years. 
As a result of Sanofi's performance in 2021, 
we announced that the board has proposed a dividend of 3 euros 33 cents. A growing dividend remains an important element of our capital allocation, 
but it ranks behind our organic investment on business develo- developments in our priorities. 
On slide 30, we provide an outlook, highlighting expected business dynamics across sales and expenses. 
Focusing on the left part of this slide, you can see expected drivers of sales across our GBUs, including the continuation of strong growth from Dupixent, record flu season, and maintained business momentum for the core products of consumer health and gen med. 
As communicated before, we expect consumer health priority brands to grow above market in key geographies, resulting in growth for the entire business, 
but only progressively nearing market rates. 
At the same time, we also foresee overall GBU sales in gen med to stabilize. 
The EUROAPI third party sales are currently consolidated in this business. 
And upon the planned EUROAPI IPO, gen med sales will be reduced by that amount going forward. 
On the right part of the slide, we expect gross margin to continue to improve due to product mix and 
efficiencies. R&D expenses are expected to continue to grow in line with our strategy. 
As we keep streamlining our gen med and CHC business, we expect to generate around 500 million in capital gains throughout 2022. 
We estimate that our 2022 ETR, effective tax rate, to be around 19%, one-nine, given the evolution of our product and geographic mix. 
This estimate is based, of course, on current tax legislation. 
So, on my final slide, slide 31, we expect full year ' 22, 2022 business EPS to grow in the low double digits at CER. 
On our way to achieve our 2022 financial targets, we also guide to a BOI margin of 30% for the year. 
On foreign exchange, we see a positive currency impact of 2 to 3% based on January average exchange rates. 
With 9.2% EPS growth in 2020, our 15.5% EPS growth at CER in 
2021, we are on track for a third year of double-digit or near double-digit EPS growth. 
I hand now the, the call back to Paul. Well, thanks, 
JB. Uh, we expect 2022 to be another busy year with important, excuse me, milestones for our priority molecules and other pipeline programs. 
We're looking forward to the results of four pivotal studies, including amcenestrant in second and third-line metastatic breast cancer, 
as well as the phase three results of efanesoctocog alfa in hemophilia. 
The readout of Dupixent in chronic cold induced to the carrier may add another dermatological indication, addressing a population of 25,000 patients in the US alone. 
We also anticipate making further important pivotal trial decisions, especially in oncology and, uh, um, vaccines. 
Moving to slide 34, into ESG, you may remember that our social impact strategy was approved by the Sanofi board a little more than a year ago. 
Our renewed contract with society is fully aligned and embedded with our business strategy and ambitions. We made good progress across all our four pillars. 
Today, I would like to highlight some achievements in the area of affordable access. 
The mission of the Sanofi Global Health Unit we created last year is to increase access to essential medicines in some of the world's poorest countries. 
In the area of malaria, TB, and noncommunicable diseases, we have increased both the number of patients reached and the number of countries. 
In addition, Sanofi is committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatment. 
We donated again more than 100,000 vials in 2021. 
This builds on a 30-year humanitarian commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases. 
Moving to Slide 35, as we look into the 2022 calendar, we will update you every quarter on our new initiatives happening across the four pillars of our ESG strategy. 
This quarter, we wanted to put the focus on access. 
We are proud to announce a partnership with Medtronic Labs and the launch of a multi-country, multi-year collaboration in the field of noncommunicable diseases. 
Together, we will leverage digital health and a community-based approach to improve disease awareness, 
diagnosis, and management of diabetes and hypertension, 
in strong collaboration with health system partners. 
The public health burden of NCDs is staggering, with 35 million deaths globally, of which 
28 million occur in low to middle-income countries every year. 
This project will contribute to strengthening health systems as they build towards universal health coverage and sustainable development goals. 
On my final slide, let me touch on some planned events in the first half of this year. 
As mentioned, we expect to have further tolebrutinib data presented at ACTRIMS, and we'll organize a virtual event around this. 
Invites will be sent out shortly. 
We also plan for an update on, on our immunology pipeline, including Dupixent in late March. 
As part of this update, we will revise upward our peak sales potential for this medicine. 
We are currently finalizing our plans for an event focused on ESG that we hope could take place in the June-July timeframe. 
Well, let's open the call now for Q&A. 
Thank you. We will now open the call to your questions. We would like to ask that you limit your questions two each, so we can call up a number of the participants. 
You have two options to participate. Click the raise hand icon at the bottom of your screen. You will be notified when your line is open to ask a question. 
At that time, please make sure you unmute your microphone. 
Or option two, submit your questions by clicking the Q&A icon at the bottom of your screen and your question will be read out. 
Can we now have the first question? 
Yes. The first question comes from Wimal Kapadia from Bernstein. Wimal? Oh, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. 
Wimal Kapadia from Bernstein. So, first, can I just ask, uh, on the, the US flu business, uh, you know, declined year on year. Uh, Tom, uh, you, you flagged a, a 17% mar- market contraction in volumes. 
So, could you just provide a bit more color on your expectations for the volume value mix for the US in ' 
22? And what was the level of coverage in ' 21? Was that actually below historical pre- COVID levels? And if so, should we be, should we be getting a nice bounce in, in coverage in 2022, specific to the US? 
And then my second question is just on the OX- the OX40. 
Um, you know, we had, had some data last year for the OX40 program from, uh, you know, which is now a priority asset. Just curious how you're thinking about targeting the OX40 versus the OX40-Ligand. 
And then, I'd love to hear, you know, how you think about the duration of effect. Just given, looking at Amgen's drug, looked rather compelling on that front. 
Have you seen anything from your own asset suggesting a similar efficacy profile with time? Thank you. 
Thank you, Wimal. Uh, great questions. Uh, Thomas, flu coverage, read across to ' 22. 
Thank you very much, Wimal. Indeed, you understood very well that, uh, the US flu situation in 2021 was a very specific US situation, 
uh, with minus 17 on the overall, uh, volume for the US. 
Um, and, and what that means that it was lower, uh, than 2019. 
Very specific to the US again as we-… uh, than 2019. Very specific to the US again as you seen from the other market. 
Uh, and inaudible leading to the COVID-19 uh, specification. 
You know, there was a lot of confusion with different inaudible being licensed at the same time. And a lot of decisions on the boosters. 
Uh, so definitely we don't see that as a play moving forward for 2022, 
uh, because of course if you end up being 2021 with a US vaccine inaudible that leaves room for growth. 
So we are very confident about 2022. 
We expect to see both volume and value increase in the US, uh, as of this year. 
To give you an example, and I think it's a good illustration of- of uh, of what could happen in the US for flu in 2022, um, 
I think everybody has understood that uh, there needed to be some fixes on the US inaudible and 
CMS has very interestingly decided to increase the flu vaccine administration fee 
from $17 to $30 total for the season inaudible in the US. 
So I think there's going to be a strong CDC understanding as well as strong inaudible to make sure that 2022 is very different from 2021. 
And that's why we're expecting inaudible flu season overall inaudible and indeed an increase of uh, of flu in the US in 2021. 
Thank you, thank you inaudible vaccines. Um, uh, John Reed, OX-40 
ligan. I think the question from inaudible is about duration and um, efficacy and may you have some thoughts on tolerability as well. 
Yeah, I think it was about OX-40 the receptor versus OX-40 the ligand. 
And uh, we prefer the ligand, uh, because it is uh, induced on inaudible cells, so its uh, quantity in the body is less. Whereas OX-40 is- 
is more heavily expressed on a constituent basis and can you know, 
mean that you're going to have to dose higher to- to neutralize it. But more importantly I think 
than that is the fundamental difference in the mechanisms of our molecule and inaudible acquisition, versus the Kirin antibodies that 
Amgen has accessed. Um, the Kirin 
/ 
Amgen antibody is a depleting molecule 
that uh, actually kills the cells that express OX- 40. Whereas we have a non-depleting antibody that modulated OX- 40's pathway. 
Um, the downside to depleting is that um, both effector T-cells, which are you know, contributing to the autoimmunity, 
but also regulatory T-cells that we need for suppressing autoimmunity express OX-40. 
So over time you have the risk of depleting those necessary regulatory T-cells with a depleting mechanism. 
Uh, so we feel that in terms of longterm safety and durability of the affects that uh, a non-depleting antibody targeting the ligan is really a superior way to go. 
Thank you John, couldn't agree more. Next question. 
The next question will come from Richard Buffer at JP Morgan. Richard? 
Thanks very much for taking my question. 
Uh, two questions Steven. Uh, the first one just on flu, uh- uh, as well. 
Just 
uh- uh, could you talk about your manufacturing capacity and supply and how that will develop, 
and- and the demand that you might see, uh, for high dose beyond Germany, uh, in- in Europe? 
And then second question, uh, there's clearly been quite a lot of interest, uh, for consumer assets, uh, early on this year. 
Um, does that lead you to change or accelerate any of your plans for the consumer business, uh, going forward? 
Thanks so much. Thanks Richard. 
Uh, I'll… Uh, first of all, I'll compliment Tom and the team on what they've done with the high dose launch and particularly this year and remotely, incredibly in Germany. So the question is supply and beyond. 
Thanks Richard. Definitely, uh, no concern at all on uh, on US uh- uh, or non-US flu supply. Uh, we are very confident. You know very well that last we've 
added a new flu vaccine inaudible you 
know so that we are investing into additional inaudible for the mid to longterm inaudible. 
So really moving forward on that and feeling very confident inaudible. 
Of course, as every single year 
we are always receiving the inaudible and 
at the end of the Q2 quarter we inaudible to make a little bit of inaudible. 
When it comes to demand, uh, as you inaudible very strongly, uh, this year in Germany. 
We expect this to further grow. There is room, uh, to grow in Germany. 
When it comes to inaudible Europe, we are going to introduce in 2022 in a couple of new markets in Europe. 
But you know very well when it comes to vaccine and flu inaudible 
it's about adding presidential recommendation. It's about inaudible investment. 
So we start new inaudible until we have the right investment in place and then we provide the supply. 
Thank, thank you Thomas. Uh, the consumer question, um, you know 
I think I got where you're heading Richard, uh, the thing for us goes back to what we said, 
Capital Markets Day, December 2019. 
We thought we could grow, prices were growing. We thought we could come and increase agility, accelerate growth, make better choices, prioritize and leverage e-commerce, 
and run fast all the way to the switches. And I think 
Julie and the team have done an incredible job frankly in doing that. And we're really delighted with the progress, uh, we made. 
We know a lot happens outside with other companies and different things, 
but we know the choices that we made back in ' 19 and we're very happy with how things are performing. 
Okay, next question. 
The next question will be Louisa Hector at Barrenburg. Louisa? 
Hello, thank you for taking my question. 
Um, possibly for JB, but you mentioned the headcount reduction as a positive. Can you give us an update on the euro API spend inaudible? 
And then also on gross margins, so clearly um, very good progression, working very hard on this and it's paying off. 
Can you guide us to, whether to think about a continuous improvement 
through 2023 which inaudible generic arrives? Thank you. 
Okay, thank you Lousia. 
So JB, you always get the fun ones so maybe um, um, inaudible probably 
related to headcount. You may want it a tiny bit broader, and then of course gross margin 
and go from they. Yeah, so particularly with inaudible we have the new business model inaudible but we have also 
this API activity, uh, which we've been the leader, uh, in this field. 
And uh, inaudible ' 21 -' 22 we are on course, uh, to uh, to do this. 
So yeah inaudible the results. Uh, looking forward to uh, to make it up inaudible. 
On the gross margin, yeah, effectively we- we delivered on ' 21. We are guiding again on improvement. 
On the midterm, uh inaudible make gross margin guidance inaudible 
something which is a strong element to keep in mind. 
Is that on our inaudible. Uh, we 
are going to have uh, quite a transformative journey in terms of costs, which uh, should uh, really help us, uh, 
I think to neutralize any price inaudible we could have, 
uh, because we are looking at implementing, uh, new, new manufacturing, uh, processes that will deliver strongly in terms of company improvement, 
so that's a clear 
piece. Thank you. And Louisa you didn't ask, but- but um, me, but I'm glad you asked the question because 
you know, there's a huge amount of work. You know while we're advancing the pipeline inaudible in uh, early development, 
uh, the six acquisitions. I- 
I think inaudible occasionally is the fundamental work that's going into reshaping the company, 
the right size in the company. inaudible more importantly, you know, we're having an IPO in the first half of this year at this same time. We're carving in the consumer business. 
And on all these things, we're outperforming whilst doing them, whilst delivering on the science and the overall financial performance inaudible for ' 22. 
We- we really feel like you know, the level and scale of the transformation that's happening is 
perhaps not fully understood and it's okay. But it's expensive. So maybe next question. 
Yes, next question will come from Simon inaudible. Simon? Hi, 
thank you for taking my questions and I love the new branding by the way. 
And the first, the first question is actually for JB. You know, you've given guidance for inaudible ' 22 
if you look at inaudible 
wondering if you could potentially comment on the sustainability of this inaudible how we should maybe you know, revisit our- our expectations. 
And then the second one, it's just on um, the inaudible and thank you for the updated timeframes with respect to guidance. 
I mean I think it's- it's clearly brought everything out of the water in terms of inaudible maybe can 
you comment on any impact that you're seeing 
or that you expect to see with um, the recent launch inaudible? Thank you. 
Okay, well thank you for the kinds words on the branding. 
Uh, you know for those that haven't followed it closely, you know, it is the original font from our uh, birth in 1973. 
Um, and it's also uh, an opportunity for us, uh, to- to be a little bit more disruptive and unify the company as well at the same time. 
So I'm glad that it's recognized. I- I think it's more dynamic frankly and reflective of the comment I made earlier in terms of transformation that's happening here. 
And from that high energy question to tax, John, back to crosstalk to you. 
crosstalk Thank you very much. Yeah, it's uh, it's a inaudible tax rate, 
uh, in terms of this product. 
As I said, uh, in my, in my previous speech, it's really something which is dependent of uh, further changes in the inaudible 
We have uh, inaudible uh, and let's say that the underlying uh, tax rate, uh, is like between 19 or 20. 
Uh, but as we speak, I don't know what will be the full impact inaudible changes, uh, of uh- uh taxation in- in some of the reasons, like the, like the US. 
So yeah, uh, a good trend, uh, 
with uh- uh, the trend, a big chunk of it linked to our uh, business on tax inaudible also, which is going positively. 
Uh, but that could be deferred in the midterm by other changes, uh, in other regions. 
Thank you, uh, 
JB. Um, thanks also Tom, for the compliments on inaudible which is you know, uh- uh, frankly incredible performance, 
um, and led by inaudible and the team. So those comments about new entrants and early signals. 
Yeah, well thank you for the question. 
Uh, you know, uh, none of the new entrants are a surprise for one thing. We've been planning on these. We've been waiting, in some cases extended waits, uh, for the inaudible almost a year delay. 
And while it's new competition, uh, in the US, you know we've had these uh, competitor that have already launch in Germany and uh, on the way in Japan as well. 
So we're certainly uh, used to them. 
And I think the one thing that they do is they really reinforce inaudible clinical profile that we have. 
You know, just go back to the biology. 
Targeting inaudible that is fundamental to type-2 inflammation. 
And no other product has been able to show the profile that we have in any of the type-2 diseases. And you know inaudible where we are uh, 
the leader now. 
Um, uh, asthma as well. You know, the profile again, 
uh- uh, we think is uh, the top, the best profile that is in asthma and we're, you know, seeing really very promising signs all around the world 
of uh, our ability to compete and win, uh, in the asthma space. 
Just one comment, as uh, we have competition come in to the atopic dermatitis market, 
it actually helps to serve to grow the market, grow awareness of atopic dermatitis, et cetera. 
And you know I- I, as we've had competitors launch in other countries as I said, Germany and Japan, we have seen market expansion. 
So that's what we expect, that's part of our aspiration to have a uh, you know, 25 to 30 percent 
advance therapy penetration in atopic dermatitis over time. Uh, that's one of the contributors. 
But you know, the one thing that's clear is that we are on top. We remain on top and we uh, believe being best in disease we will stay on top. 
inaudible apologies to interrupt, yeah inaudible in the US. Is there any early feedback you could share? 
No, there's really nothing that we're seeing. It's still very early. You know, we're- we're staying uh, with the trends that we've seen. 
Yeah, just to, to add a sort of point to Bill's point, which is, you know 
I think 
the uh, the assumption is always it's a zero sum game. You know inaudible for example, the baggage. And you know with the inaudible it's half the answer. inaudible so um, 
you know, and you know 
that most of these mechanisms have failed in at least one of the indications that inaudible has already approved. 
Uh, and uh, inaudible would probably be in that box too. I think, I think it failed in AD if I remember correctly. 
So- so we're uh, on one hand, we're the only medicine that will inaudible in every indication. 
On the other hand, uh inaudible every time. 
A little bit of competition to help drive up penetration of advanced therapies is absolutely essential. And to Bill's comments about Germany 
should not be underestimated because, um, you know, uh, we obviously will carry the education of these disease areas, 
but it's good that others want to come in and try and do that too. When you grow markets, when you're the market leader, it's- it's a very healthy place 
to be on behalf of patients. 
Okay, next question please. Next question will be from Graham Perry, Bank of America. Graham? 
Thank you guys for taking my questions. Um, so congratulations on getting inaudible three questions. I'm afraid I'm gonna, I'm gonna break that. <laugh> So um, uh, just wondering 
um, have accrued all the events now, um, in Data Lock, and so are we still on for Q1, 
uh- uh inaudible on that study? And the inaudible only show benefit in inaudible mutated patients 
who are obviously more rare in the front line 
setting, and- and I think that's leading to some pessimism around you know the potential in- in frontline. So perhaps if you could just address that point. 
And then secondly a question on M&As. You've done a lot of smaller pipeline deals of late. Obviously inaudible evaluations have fallen somewhat at the moment. 
inaudible are you seeing more value and opportunity to build out further in oncology where I think you highlighted inaudible? Thank you. Thank you Graham. 
I didn't hear the first part of your question 
so uh, inaudible question. Um, thank 
you, uh, for raising it. So I'm going to toss it to John. John I don't know if you heard it. It was um, you know, 
uh, the competition, uh, showed more efficacy I think in ESR, 
uh, mutation, and so what's to be the cost for us? 
And where are we on database lock and inaudible Q1. Right, right, okay Graham. Thank you. 
Um, in terms of the activity inaudible on wild type versus mutant estrogen receptor, 
we're fully active on both. Whereas the competitor molecule is better on the mutate than on the wild type, so that's not at all a liability for us. 
And so it is one of the differentiators or our molecule and one of the many factors that we think gives it a best in 
class profile, along with the uh, the pristine tolerability. 
Um, you know we're um, we expect to have the data this quarter with respect to mirror and the late line inaudible 
breast cancer. Uh, I'm also pleased to report we're fully enrolled now in the frontline study in combination with the inaudible 
inhibitor and that our, the first of our inaudible studies is now open for enrollment. 
So we're making good progress across the spectrum from early 
to late line in each of these indications where we think uh, inaudible has a strong value proposition for women with hormone receptor positive breast cancers. 
Thank you John. So um, so categorically um, Graham, uh, results in Q1. 
Uh, okay, JB, M&A? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I do think that uh inaudible it is not related to the inaudible. It's 
much more dependent on the, on the leadership of our R&D team and on John inaudible the right 
asset, which is really uh- uh, sticking with our strategy, really sticking with our uh, inaudible. 
So no specific impact from- from the terms of evaluation. It will be uh, inaudible. Uh, 
but we are, we are still on for inaudible of course. 
Right, thank you. Uh, next question please. 
Next question will be from Tim Anderson at inaudible. Tim, your question please. 
Thank you. Uh, a couple of questions. 
So inaudible uh, we'll 
be getting two readouts this year from two similarly designed inaudible your trial and then inaudible trial. 
Both companies claim best in class. 
Do you think these upcoming datasets will help prove which company is right and which company is wrong making that claim? 
Or will that not become clearer until we get additional trial readouts, such as in the first line setting? 
And then second, uh, I would love to get your thoughts on Lily's inaudible. 
They're saying they think that will have a profile that's very competitive to inaudible to 
talk about differentiation in ocular side effects. 
Uh, and I'm wondering what your thoughts are uh, on them as competitor. They do know the derm space well because of inaudible. 
Thank you. Okay, uh, a few good things in there. John, given inaudible data and our impending data, do you think we'll be able to declare a winning profile this year? 
You know, it's uh, it's a good question. Um, 
I'm not sure that these late line settings are you know, the best place to really differentiate on efficacy. 
Uh, where we do feel confident 
that we'll be able to perhaps differentiate is on the safety, tolerability profile, where- 
where so far you know, uh, inaudible has really been delivering a best in class 
profile. Whereas molecules from others, including Roche have 
been showing safety signals around cardiac, uh, issues and- and in some cases uh, vision issues. 
So um, you know, 
I think that's probably the best answer I can give you for now. Um, 
I would probably be really looking to you know, how the tolerability profiles hold up in these early lines, 
uh, as opposed to hinging a lot on uh, on this, on the efficacy profile, given 
you know, the… A lot of the uh, heterogeneity in these patient populations you see the late line 
and therefore the difficulty to really to really do cross route comparisons in a, in an apples to apples way. 
Thank John. To reiterate to everybody, 
we haven't seen the data. 
Um, we are uh, optimistic that we're in a good spot. 
And uh, we look forward to getting it. You all know I think it's a small indication if we are successful, um, so in terms of value perspective, 
it's not as important um, although it may bring benefit to those that need it. Let's be frank. But from a confidence perspective, you know it's important to everybody. 
Um, so uh, when we have the data, you'll be soon after us in terms of knowing. As for… I- 
I do think whereas in most of the areas that I've worked, tolerability inevitably plays a part inaudible touched on it. 
Tolerability- tolerability will be a key differentiator. And if I understand correctly, the competitor you referenced at a lower dose, 
um, continues to have inaudible challenges. So you know, that, we think those things are going to be very, very important over the longer term. 
Um, Bill inaudible Lily is saying that they have a winning profile. 
Yeah, thanks for the question. Um, you know as Paul said I think earlier on, uh, with inaudible it's incomplete. 
It's missing the inaudible so we think starting with the biology, it's not the complete biology. 
So when you take a look at their results, and let's- let's remember these are phase two B results, they're still waiting on their uh, later results. 
Uh, you know, there's nothing that really uh, stands out from our perspective. 
Uh, efficacy uh, looks, uh, it looks fine. Uh, the conjunctivitis looks uh, similar to uh, Dupixent. Um, you know, 
I think some of the big differences are is that uh… Um, you know, I think some of the big differences are, is that, uh, we're six years ahead, uh, at that point, by the time they launch. Uh, we are, you know, a mega blockbuster, 
uh, inaudible the standard of care. 
So, I think for somebody to come in with something that isn't so much to offer, you know, 
I think that that is, regardless of your experience in a therapeutic area, 
uh, it's not therapeutic experience in, uh, atopic dermatitis. So, you know, as we said, it's, uh, it's part of the story, IL- 13's certainly not the full, we've got the best profile. 
crosstalk. 
Yeah, I think, well… oh, sorry, was there a follow on? Thank you. inaudible. Okay then. So, yeah. inaudible, you know, it's great that they have experience with inaudible. Uh, 
I have a lot of experience with inaudible. Uh, and, and nobody's got the experience like we have in AD. 
And, I'm telling you what the team has done with inaudible is incredible. We never underestimate competition, particularly well organized ones. 
But just inaudible the biology, like Bill said, and there's, if you've got half the answer, you have 
a long road to hope. I'm sure they made some progress. So, let's go all the way back to the fundamental which is 
an additional, um, weight, uh, in the market. inaudible and inaudible penetration is welcome. 
And if we have the best profile, which we believe we do, then we will disproportionately benefit from that. 
So, um, you know, we look forward to the meeting in March where we'll update you in more deeply about 
our forecast and indeed our immunology pipeline in general. Next question, I think? 
Yes, next question comes from Mark Purcell. Um, inaudible Mark, it's crosstalk. 
crosstalk, thank you. Thanks for your time, thanks everyone. Um, two questions. First on the inaudible. 
Um, could you give us a, an update in terms of where you are in terms of, um, advanced, uh, therapy penetration rates in AD, versus the 25-30 % you just gave. 
Uh, and also some idea of, uh, an indication split. 
Um, but ahead of the 29th of March, just to sort of get us in, in the mood, 
um, possibly you could help us understand, sort of, where you believe in the future are you inaudible could be. Obviously, inaudible has grown 80% from a, a lower base in the US, 
but where eventually do you feel inaudible could be? 
And then the second one on inaudible 7-0-7 or inaudible 2-4-5, the IL-2, uh, phase three gonna go, decision's coming up in the second half of this year. 
I wonder if you can help us understand which indications and lines of therapy those decisions will be made on, if it's inaudible or, or combination therapy. 
And what sort of gating decisions when making that huddle, uh, into phase three? 
Okay, thank you Mark. Uh, Bill, I think the question is, where are we now, and, uh, what is the penetration, how does it evolve towards that 20-30 % you're talking about? 
Yeah. So, uh, thanks for the question. We've got a, you know, still a long way to go. Um, just to give you, uh, a sense, in, uh, US, uh, adult AD is 7.9%. 
And when I say the finish line's looking at, you know, 25, 30%, which is a little bit, in, it's the, in the range of psoriasis, maybe a little bit higher. 
Um, we've got a long way to go. So, between inaudible what, what Paul said along the way, new competitors in the marketplace help to accelerate that. 
Um, regarding, uh, uh, US inaudible, you know, we have seen some similar patterns in every market that we've launched in the world following the US from 
a, uh, growth perspective. 
We continue, uh, to see that we expect that. Uh, we're not gonna comment on what we think the ultimate geographic distribution will be, or indications inaudible. Yeah. I've got, uh, you know, 
I think as, as well, 
you know, uh, as, as your inaudible take some an, inaudible, most of all, take some time to, to get to the boom-bust, um, cycles. 
And so, it always starts slower, then it probably gets more interesting, and the everybody always starts to ask questions about it. 
Then, now, we, Bill, we don't need to share the relative proportions, but, uh, the fact that the rest of the world will just get stronger and stronger in terms of its contribution 
because the medicine inaudible, and 
I think Bill mentioned China earlier. 
That is quite a, 10,000 patients, um, in just months, 
I think starts to help you understand, uh, where we might be heading. 
Um, uh, John inaudible 2-4-5, or formerly known as 4 -7-0-7, um, it likely indications with, and inaudible thoughts on, 
I think it was combo? Yeah, uh, uh, thanks for the question. Uh, maybe before jump into inaudible 2-4-5, though, since you brought up 
the immunology event coming in March, we're really looking forward to, not only talking about Dupixent, but also the broader portfolio. You know, we've grown from just 
six molecules in development for immunology to now 17, and, so, you'll be, you know, hearing about our, our biologics that include inaudible, the IL-33 antibody, and development for inaudible. Our engineered interleukin-2 on the other flip side of the story, inaudible that stimulates regulatory T-cells instead of effector T-cells. 
Our bi-specific multi inaudible nanobodies that do nifty things like neutralizing both TNF and IL-23 in a single molecule, the new concept for inflammatory bowel disease, 
C-40 inaudible etc. 
As well as our oral small molecule portfolio of 
inaudible, a unique BCK inhibitor, our inaudible inhibitor, or oral TNF inhibitor, and the inaudible degrader. 
So, that portfolio for immunology has really blossomed, and we look forward to talking more about that in March. 
Now, the inaudible 2-4-5, we have, um, a large platform study underway in lung, head, neck, GI, skin, and lymphoma. 
And, like most companies, we sort of started with the obvious to do combinations with PD-1, and we're pursuing that. 
But this year we will be embarking on novel combos with other kinds of 
mechanisms. Uh, I would note, for example, that we have three T-cell engagers now in development. Uh, we have our first NK-cell engager inaudible in development. We have our universal inaudible-cell platform. So, there's a lot to think about as combination opportunities with inaudible 2-4-5, 
uh, across a range of solid tumors and hematologic, uh, malignancies. 
Um, this will be a rich year for generating those early data signals. 
Uh, we're, we're eagerly anticipating what, uh, we might be able to do with this, uh, this inaudible version of interleukin-2. Uh, thanks, thanks John. I, 
I do think, and I, when we 
talking about inaudible. And even the number of inaudible that we're gonna get across the pipeline, but particularly in oncology, is gonna be quite interesting this year. While we know they're only early for some of you, inaudible, what 
we like to be an emerging player in oncology, there'll be nice moments for us to make some decisions about which way to go. And, and we're optimistic. 
Um, next, next question, please? Yeah, next question would be from inaudible at Deutsche Bank. inaudible. 
Thank you for taking the questions. Um, perhaps I could give one, with one on inaudible. 
Um, just your expectations, or, or your ambitions, perhaps, for the upcoming digital data. 
I think you said you're hoping to show above inaudible expression above 40% inaudible four days. 
What sort of figures would you be hoping to be showing at seven days, and what kind of 
share implications do you think that could have, relative to what are locked as 
at present? Indeed, if, if you could give us inaudible, that would be helpful as well. 
Then, perhaps if I can question on the inaudible given the decision to progress accommodation to inaudible antigen. 
Just wondering, do you see inaudible confident on synergy for that combination, given, 
um, the pretty clear lack of inaudible therapy activity, uh, and the timing that potentially either phase one or basically ongoing 
phase two being presented to us at the scientific conference. That'd be helpful, thank you. Uh, thank you Emmanuel. Um, then it's, I'll 
try and come to you in a moment, but Bill, did you have any comment on that? Just on the inaudible. 
I don't think we've declared what our expectation is, 
uh, but, um, you know, certainly our profile is gonna best in class, and Bill, do you wanna comment? 
Yeah, I think that's right. I think if you, if you take a look at what we showed in the phase two, which showed that, you know, 
uh, over half the week, uh, four days where you're at essentially a near normal level. 
And by the end of the week it tapers off to in the, uh, 10% I believe, uh- Yeah, but still quite a- 
crosstalk-… quite strong protection-… yeah. even at the end of the week. crosstalk- Yeah. 
I mean, this, uh, you just look on, on the slide that, uh, that I showed. You know, no one's even close to that. 
And no one's even close to that with a once 
weekly. So, this we consider really transformative in the hemophilia inaudible space. 
You know, when you think about, uh, patients, uh, kids who wanna have an active lifestyle, 
and if you can give them something they've never seen before, then maybe for, you know, just a brief moment, normal, and you do that for the better part of the week, 
you know, you begin to think about giving them a little bit more of their life back. 
And being active and so forth. So, you know, we're really excited, that's what, 
and we expect to see that, uh, uh, in our phase, uh, three. At least, we hope, you know, that's, uh, it's at a pretty high bar, 
uh, set a high bar for us and a high bar for the market, I think, overall. 
So, uh, you know, uh, stay tuned. More to come on that one, but, um, you know, this is really something which is different. 
No one's been able to offer this before, so I think, you know, we're hearing patient community's really excited. 
Yeah, I know, and it's, inaudible that's obviously inaudible. I think, uh, the real question is, can it go even longer? 
Depending on which, uh, where the patient's longer term, I mean, it gets very exciting, so, inaudible and our confidence is building as you know for gene therapy. 
At least this generation doesn't seem to be, 
you know, definitive, uh, and, of course, inaudible comes more towards the weekly or bi-weekly itself. 
You know, then, then wh- the opportunities is perhaps even bigger than we thought when we started on this journey, I'll be honest. And, of course, half the market's inaudible, like Bill said. So, it's been quite interesting for us. 
Uh, John, maybe you, uh, inaudible? 
Yeah, so, you know, the reason that we're pursuing that combination is because in pre-clinical studies where we and others tried different combinations 
of inaudible with various other signal transaction locking molecules, 
that was always consistently the place where we saw the best com- the best combination from efficacy. So, the most synergy. 
And, again, this is not just an inaudible data, but it's inaudible data, inaudible data, etc. 
So, we think that if there's a combination where inaudible can 
shine, this is it. 
And we're doing the studies this year, it's another one of these where the signals will be the important determinant of what kind of trajectory we can take with that mechanism. 
Uh, so, um, that's the rationale. And, uh, the data will, uh, hopefully speak for themselves, and we'll be gathering it this year. Thanks, John. 
And maybe, Emmanuel, I'll just thank you for the, the research you did on inaudible. I found it really interesting. Our, our 
physicians, um, were really thinking, confident already, and thinking about moving to earlier lines. I mean, of course, it's just a survey. 
But, but I did find it insightful, and we, we enjoyed reading that. So, thank you for, for that work. Y- you're welcome inaudible. Congratulations on the strong launch. 
Tha- thank you very much. Um, uh, means a lot. 
Um, okay. Uh, Emma. 
inaudible. crosstalk- crosstalk, yes, last, last question would be from Matthew West inaudible, Matthew. Um, it's 
the, it's Jo here, I'm sorry. crosstalk. Um, I think c- the, uh, I, I had two questions. 
Um, on inaudible, I wonder, you've given us the 8% penetration in the, uh, US adult market in, um, AD. 
Uh, perhaps half of the, uh, sales potential comes from other indications. So 
I wonder if you could just tell us how successful you've been in penetrating things like asthma 
so that we can see how broad the appeal of this beyond atopic dermatitis. And I, I noted that you're going to update our sa- your sales projections. 
Was that before you had the COPD data? 
I thought you were waiting for that before you gave us an update? 
Um, my second question would be on, um, 
inaudible. So, uh, I would've assumed that if somebody was interested in efficacy, but not so concerned on safety, they may already have moved for a factor to a non-factor. 
So, safety is likely to be a very important part in making the decisions for these patients to move onto your new product. 
How much safety data will you have at the time of submission and launch? 
And what makes you so confident that people won't think that the different pharmacodynamics of this factor 
could impact on the safety characteristics of the product? 
Okay, inaudible… so, you're, keep me guessing, sometimes you can't connect, and then you're here with Matthew West. 
So, but either which way, inaudible we got, we got to the questions. 
Um, inaudible, uh, in, uh, other indications penetration. Bill? 
Yeah, so, uh, you know, yes, if you look, uh, Jo, in asthma. 
Uh, we're at about 19% biologics penetration, 
okay? So that's the, the starting point. 
And then, um, as, uh, you've heard from a, uh, uh, uh, inaudible perspective we're, uh, leading in each of the, um, yeah, each of the specialists with Dupixent. Um, and, 
a- uh, the other, the other indications, uh, uh, you know, look, uh, 
we're, uh, it depends, again, on the biopenetrations. You know, they're 
pretty low, we're s- we're starting with, you know, a brand new indication, so to speak, with, uh, nasal polyps, we're the only player there. 
Uh, uh, still working on the inaudible, but, uh, it appears as though we're having good, strong penetration there. Won't give the number at this time. 
Uh, regarding, uh, the second question was… 
Um, uh, well there's one about why aren't we waiting for the COPD data. And inaudible I'm happy to answer, but then it, we'll move to- Oh. a safety and efficacy trade-off on inaudible. 
Yeah. So if you inaudible with 
John. Uh, there was, so, uh, Jo, we can't win. 
If we, if we wait to see while you're waiting, and if we, if we, uh, don't wait to see why we're not waiting. 
So, I, I, I'm, we're sort of inaudible between. I think because the COPD data is in ' 23, 
I think we all felt, uh, the, a good time to take stock, uh, would be towards the end of Q1, and, and, even at inaudible 
immunology catch up that we think that's worth doing. And, of course, 
um, we won't be able to declare a new inaudible without referencing, you know, that it's like, you know, it'll be different with COPD, if the data wins out. 
How we frame that 
when, we're very early in the thinking. So, inaudible on that until we get there, but I just don't think, given the run rate, and the prescriptions, 
that we can let, we can ask people to wait a full year, or more actually, 
to, uh, to understand what the, the peak could be. 
John, I don't really got it all on the safety-efficacy trade-off and what data we'll have, uh, crosstalk- Yeah. I'm, I'm a little, 
I'd say I'm a little surprised by the question because it's safety of, um, this next generation factor eight, uh, is, is pristine. 
We, there, there have been no safety signals. 
We don't have any reason, really, to believe there would be any. 
Um, I, you could almost say, you know, to some extent, 
uh, that way was paved with, uh, products like 
inaudible which, uh, fused as an FC region onto factor eight, and here there's some additional embellishments with, uh, the so-called extend technology. 
But that had also been de-risked with other molecules that have been taken the clinic, including in approved products. So, the components of the molecule have all 
been de-risked, and we've not seen any safety liabilities. 
On the other hand, if you think about alternatives, uh, they do have some safety <laugh>, uh, historical safety baggage. 
So, I really think on the safety standpoint, again, we come out best in class. 
Yeah, and John, just, just to add to that. Uh, you know, I think, clearly from an efficacy perspective inaudible too. 
I mean, no one's, i- i- if you look at the comparison where inaudible is, if you try to, you know, estimate where it is, it's nowhere near normal. Right? 
It's nowhere near normal to, uh, uh, uh, uh, factor of levels. 
So, you know, we're really confident that we win on the, on the safety, um, for, you know, just redefine the safety bar, 
and then it's, uh, you know, you're looking at a weekly, uh, dose. 
Um, that's pretty convenient as well. 
So, you know, I think across both, uh, parameters, we're in, we're in, uh, really, uh, good shape. 
yeah, thank you. You know, when I joined the company a lot of people asked questions like, did the company not understand inaudible was coming when we got into inaudible. And, um, half 
the people responsible for inaudible work for us now. John Reid, Franks, 
uh, but one thing we did learn was that, uh, these patients are dynamic, and they will move fast. 
If they see a better choice to be made, 
particularly if you're not a two-monthly, you're actually a every one to two weeks, that's been the case with the non-factor… 
Bill said, you know, set a new standard, uh, 
I think the competition is slightly more concerned that the patients are much more likely to change, is what got them their position in the third place, first place. 
And it's what we'll do when we launch with inaudible, which is not that far away. 
So, uh, so thank you for, for those questions. 
Uh, thank you to everybody for the energy and the contribution, 
um, and delighted, by the way, as always with starting to transition more towards science and, and, uh, the transformation of the company. A little less just on the basic financials which 
every day we're responsible for, don't even think that we're not. 
But, we think in terms of value creation and in the right to bring our pipeline forward and surprise you, um, is very, very important. 
Uh, nothing's off the table. We've, we've inaudible the company real time. You may not see it, inaudible you don't, you're not part of it. 
But I think, as we look back, and I'm to, particularly this full year, you know, we get to look at the distance traveled just in 12 months. I think it feels like we've come an awful long way. 
And while we've got some news coming up ahead of us and we hope it's all positive, 
um, you know, we will keep moving forward finding signals, and advancing 36 programs that were not, uh, moving last year, uh, sorry, the beginning of last year, that moved last year. 
And inaudible for the first time in the company's history. 
The penny should be dropping that our ability to pivot on science is really, uh, in full flight. 
So, uh, thank you to everybody in team, uh, thank you, uh, to inaudible, thanks inaudible. Thank you very much, you may now disconnect.
