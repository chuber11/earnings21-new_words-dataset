Good morning everyone. We are beginning our first quarter of first year a new campaign for Cresud. 
And we are planting an uh, in very good conditions in the region. 
Similar size of last years, and we are going to show you a little later about the four countries and the size of plantation. 
Uh, we, um, in this year, we are budgeting and we are seeing better prizes than last year 
and higher markings comparing to last year. Having some bigger input costs, in some, like, fertilizers much more bigger. 
Uh, but margins since comparing this year to last year are a little higher. 
Um, we related to the real estate business, so remember that we have three lines of businesses, 
one is reproduction size, and the yields on the production. 
The second is the real estate and the third is services in agriculture. 
Relating to the real estate in the first quarter, we have on news in Brazil. In this quarter we have no news in Argentina and in the rest of the countries. 
A lot of sales in there and a lot of liquidities in- in Brazil related to the real estate business. 
About our segment through Ilsa, 
the Yurban segment, it's recovering a lot. This quarter was all open. Uh, we saw the shopping centers open, 
the hotels beginning to open and the inaudible receiving a lot of the local tourism. 
Uh, so there is a lot of recovery and we are going to see very much better numbers in the real estate 
uh, and their occupation suffered something, but comparing to last year numbers, they are much better. 
Uh, related to the quarter of production, 
we were driven by the sugar cane activity and here the dark activity gave us much better research and was mainly explained by the- the frozen than the country received in the winter, that made a big lost in the southern regions of- of Brazil and that made an increase, a very important increase in the sugar cane prices 
combined with the- the oil prices in- increase. 
So the combination of the two, made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugar cane. 
And in our case, our plantations were in regions that they were not affected in production, 
so that combination made us a big gain and in the others a good quarter too. 
Uh, related to the m- oil effect on our balance sheet, 
we see a net gain, that was mainly explained by this gross profit, financial result and income tax 
and there is a loss related to the fair value of I- Ilsa. The investment property received a lost, and Mathius will explain later about this loss. 
Finally we had a gain of close to 2 billion Pesos, attributable to controlling chair-holders. 
So this is the main explanation of the- of the quarter. I will introduce <unk> Okay, 
thank you Alejandro, move to the slide number three, about the spread of inaudible 
Uh, we can see on the graph, this Fiscal year, 2022, we'll continue on the top of the ranking for the third years in a row. 
The area we are planting now, is 2000- 2000, uh, 
262,000 hectors, inaudible around the full country, you can see in the graph. 
Similar to the last year. 40… 
14,000 Paraguay, 14,000 inaudible 
111,000 Brazil, and 123,000 in Argentina. 
About the cropters, uh, breakdowns. Uh, the crops, uh, this year remain to some of the last three years, for a- for a 6% soy bean 
27% corn, 
9% sugar cane, 3% wheat, and the other inaudible 8% for a total inaudible 
Moving to the next slide about farming activity, inaudible Uh, in 
the graph to the left, uh, about store consumptions, the soy bean and the corn is tout, remaining globally low, 
uh, having soy bean about 27.7% and corn 25.4%. 
In case of inaudible in this graphic, show you that there's inaudible are even lower than of the rest of the world. 
Having soy bean of about 7.3% and corn 10.1% respectively. 
This start-up consumptions, have a relation about the inaudible prices. 
In relation about that, we can see a- a up-surge in the graph. 
inaudible prices probably… previously went up to reaching- reaching the tops in inaudible 2021 
uh, about soy beans, 64% and corn 113%. 
However, along the following five months 
there was a moderate corrosion in the biases drop in. 17% in Soy bean and 25% in corn. 
inaudible in corn. Now the current 
version on Hit precissions uh, is uh, 
in- in- in prices similar as the budget. 
inaudible soy beans inaudible five and 56% and in corn 51% and- and similar prices to the budget. 
About climate condition and showing process. 
It's showing the bottom ride of the graph, the climate condition of Argentina and Brazil, categorically in comparison to the inaudible season of the last year. 
Currently the focus mark neutrality as they inaudible move away. 
Regarding to the current inaudible in process, November 2021, the total soy 
bean is 23%, Bolivia, 64%, Brazil, 40% and Argentina 2%. 
Total in corn is 13%, Bolivia, 99%, Brazil 30% and Argentina 20%. 
And the last one wheat, we have 100%, uh, of the planting because now we are adjusting and starting to harvest in Argentina. 
Thank you everybody. Very good. The next page we can see what happened in the farmland sales 
and these two operation transactions were done in Brazil. 
Uh, none of them was reflected on the balance sheet, 
uh, because they… We are going… We are putting transactions a day of… surpassing some level of payment, and giving possession 
and uh, that was not accomplished on the 30 of September, in the… none in the n- two crisis. 
Uh, the two sales are, in two different regions. The first one, Rio de Mayo, 
uh, it was done in September. Uh, productive area that we sold is 2,900 hectors, uh, 
but we bought for 40 million Reals, and we sold for 130 million Reals in a nominal sale. 
Remember inaudible in Brazil, we sell in installments, relating to sa- to tax of soy beans. 
So when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value 
and we might, the internal rate of return is the… with the present value. 
I'm giving us in the first case, an internal rate of returning Real is of 56% and in the case of tourist 40%. 
That was a transaction done when we did the merge with Agrifirma that we merged through paying through shares of Brasilagro. 
And in this case, 
uh, all is telling the third of the farm will recover what we paid for the whole farm. 
So it was a big gain, it is a very important gain for the first quarter doing this small transaction. 
The second one, 
uh, that it will… It was done in October 21, still not recog- recognized and it probably will be on the 3rd, 30 of December, 31 of December. 
Uh, in here we are selling a productive area of 2,700 hectors. 
For a total number of 589 million Reals. 
This is uh, bigger than the first IPO the company did, only selling 2,700 hectors. 
So a small, a look at what is that price per hector, 
it is depending in a present value or nominal value. 30,000 or more, or 40,000 or more Reals per he- Dollars per hector, sorry. So 
$40,000 or $30,000 are inaudible more in the present or nominal value. 
So give us the rea- the- the real valuation of the land in Brazil. 
This is a transaction that will be recognized in two steps. 
Uh, first step, it is more than half, 2,500, uh, uh, 
1,500, sorry, hectors of yo- uh, of productive area in the first trudge, and the second trudge will be like, 1,100 hectors in 
2024. 
So this is a big transaction, uh, giving us a big gain for this year, uh, for the 24- 2024 too. 
And internal rate of return, this farm was bought in 2007 if I don't remember incorrectly. 
So, a- a long story, giving is a… like 20% in Reals or 12% in Dollars, 
a big gain. And again, when we see a farm has a 3% return, we sell it and we begin to invest it in another area or in another activity. 
So first semester or first quarter with activity in Brazil, but still not reflecting in our balance sheets. 
We can move now to page number six. 
Um, we would like to… ever quarter to be mentioned in some of… What our agricultural services are doing. Here in this page, we are reflecting the two field on Agrifi. 
Uh, field inaudible owns 50.1% 
And lets see what is the common satisfaction status. This company became the first of the country by far. 
Commercializing the grains, inputs, future inaudible services, so 
this company, that today, this year surpassed 6.4%, 
uh, we can see the breakdown of uh, what is our participation on the- on the- on the corn, wheat and soy beans. 
This company became, by more than 2 million tons, bigger than the competitors, 
and this is really making a gain the 
e- 
the EFT- EFT- EBT Evolution, we see that, uh, we are achieving close to $15 million record of the company coming five, six years ago, close to break-even, so 
this company is becoming relevant to Cresud. 
I am to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt, 
went to the market and raised $12.3 million at a zero interest rate, through the local capital market 
in two years period. 
So this will be for the investment in fixed asset and working capital. But this company is mainly employees, 
this year is passing more employees than Cresud, 
feel it is close to 300 employees, Chris with agriculture in Argentina is something like that. 
This company's is pure, services to farmers, from the input to the experts, from the commodities and the specialities. 
This company is growing not only in Argentina, 
they gaining their expansion in the region. Growning to the inputs to the rest of South America. In the outward it's beginning in Brazil, 
through Filho in Brazil. 
So this company is beginning to be very inaudible onto our strategy. 
And on the other slide in the right, we can see the evolution of Agrifi were pursuit stake is 20%. 
Agrifi not only expanding to Argentina, but Uruguay, Brazil, 
Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile and going to Columbia. 
So growing in revenues, growing the last year in 87%. 
They give him the first transaction of farmers in the… This is the A-commerce for the agriculture business. 
And this is the leading country in the region. With annual basis of 31 million per- per participants with a monthly contacts. 
Finishing a capital race this stage. Raising more capital to expand information. So this is becoming the marketplace of the agriculture business. 
So the two were in lot in the whole region. We are seeing much more result of Cresud through these two companies. 
inaudible hierarchy. Thank you, 
Alejandro, good morning everyone. 
If we move to page seven, 
we can see the different performance of our segments in the Yuban side through our participation in Ilsa. 
Our shopping malls, we are happy that for first time in the last one year and a half, we are running without restrictions 
that, uh, all the pandemic restrictions were clear by the inaudible So now we can run on the normal, 
uh, on the normal operation. 
We can see that after the affect of the pandemic, we have an occupancy of almost 90%, 
if we leave aside the of Valerela that left the country. 
We have 94.3%, the acute policy is grouwing. Quarter by quarter, so we expect to have better numbers by going forward. 
When we see the real sales, 
of course when we compare with the previous year, now the operation was closed, we see, uh, uh, a inaudible number 322% above last year. 
When we compare with pre-pandio- 0. 
So we help to- to see better numbers going forward as well. 
For those at the offices, we remain with the same 
size of the portfolio. Size of the portfolio, inaudible 114.000 square meters. After 
selling some properties, And with in our relation of Catalinas building, that we did during the December. 
The Cubans say, service levels of 77.9%. The average, rent per square meter remains stable at the levels of 25% for square metter. 
We saw companies are back to the officers with a inaudible morality. 
But our operation never close in the- in the office 
portfolio. 
Uh, after the closing of the quarter, 
we announced a new sail of some Florest of the 261 inaudible building. 
We saw three floors for $32 million, um, 
beut we already collected all the inaudible on the way here, are you saying that moeey who relvelas the leve. 
Uh, inaudiblehotels, they from inaudiblein Argentina, just opened for foreigners in November. 
In the city of inaudible we're really affected by this situation, 
in the south of the country since the local started traveling around their country, they are brave, even the inside shower was very good. 
And we hope to see the recover in the city of inaudible going forward. 
Uh, one 
important announcement on Ilsa side was the announcement of the merge, 
or the proposal of the merge that was ounch of something 
in September. 
Uh, we should call for the shareholders meeting that will take place on December 22. 
So after this, they are- If the merch sis approved, 
inaudible will reuse the stake in Urss from 62%… This is because 
we don't hany issuest. 
This is because we will issue shares for minorities shareholders of years of shats. 
Going to our final sheet and the results of the quarter in page 9. 
We can see that we are finishing the quarter with a gain of 2.8 million 
Peeoz compared with 11.4 billion peso last year, inaudible 2 million pesos, against 4.4 billion pesos last year. 
We have here several different drivers. 
If we see on the left side in the agribusiness, we have results that are in line with a previous year. 
We are finishing with an operating income of almost 2.3 million pesos and that's the same number last year, 
we will see more details in the- in the next page. 
In the Yuban business, we are showing a loss of 4.6 million pesos, against a important gain of 35.1 million pesos. 
Last year this is related to the change in the fur value. If you see in line six, 
there you have the results, that last year we posted a gain of 36 million pesos and this year a loss of 6.4 million pesos. 
This is related to the macro economic drivers of Argentina. We are running our properties 
basically at Dollar chance, similar with the previous quarter. 
But when we convert that into pesos and then compare with inflation, inflation was, 
let us hope 9% during the quarter. And the evaluation of the official exchange rate was only 3% of- or the inaudible swap was 7%. 
So that effect generate losses in pesos terms in the balance sheet. 
Um, so we can move to the next page, page inaudible that here we have the great inaudible segment. 
We can see very good results of the agribusiness. 
Um, we campaign different with the previous year, was the sugar cane line, line four. 
That this is related to better price, 
um, um, um, better production so… Also adjusted by inflation, we have a much better gain than the previous year. 
And then in the rest of the land… Lines, we are similar with the previous year, the first quarter is not the most inaudible on quarter for grapes, 
um, so we will see the results going forward. 
In the capital we have the fact of inflation that price is 
adjusted inaudible inflation so we are recognizing a loss here, but after the quarter we see a, uh, the increasing prices of a… where will we 
go in the following quarter. 
And the results of inaudible as Alejandro mentioned it was very good results, so we- we keep increasing 
the inaudible gap of that segment. 
inaudible farmer says, all that inaudible that Alejandro mentioned will be recognized in the balance sheet probably in the next quarter. 
But will inaudible in steps. 
But we will see better results going forward. In the previous year, we- we have again, related to inaudible some- some farms that we sold are payable at max of soy beans, so we, last year, 
also the increasing prices, 
we see recovery in that line and that- that doesn't happen this quarter. 
Regarding the Yuban segment. 
Here is more difficult to compare. We are comparing with an operation in the malls that was closed, uh, uh, during the previous year. 
So here you can see that last year we inaudible that loss. 
This year we are recovering, with almost normal operation in terms of revenues, we will have some concessions, but, 
going forward, that, uh, that will disappear, so we are now running that complete normal operation. 
In the case of the offices, we seeing stable results, here we have different drivers on increasing 
score meals, because of the inaudible and some that will increase because of the inaudible 
And the hotels with inaudible again, positive numbers, uh, and inaudible development during the quarter that was now significant inaudible 
In page 11 we see the, 
uh, the other important effect that we have in the financial statements. We have a net financial results of 
3 million pesos positive, against 
a loss last year of 3.9 
million pesos of loss. 
Um, the recent theory is basically the facts, 
and we see last year we have uh, real evaluation of 0.4% inaudible evaluation of 8.1% 
and this quarter we have a nominal evaluation of 3.2, and appreciation in real terms of 5.6%. 
That generate that when we value our debt in dollars into pesos, 
we are recognizing again, inaudible line to the next 
exchange inaudible 
Uh, finally in page 12 we have the breakdown inaudible and um, that 
remain stable compared with the previous quarter. 
What we did during the quarter was to issue around $60 million in the local market, through two different transactions, 
one was related to the central bank regulation that force companies to refinance part of the debt, 
in order to have access, uh, to buy dollars. 
So we did the transaction very successfully in July 2021. 
And then in September 21, we issued $41.8 million, 
uh, to refinance, uh, a bond that- that expired in December at 3.5% interest rate, that will- 
will… with a maturity in December 2024. 
Uh, last 
week we also announced 
that related to our bond that expire in December 21, the 53… $53.6 million. 
We call that bond, uh, in advance, so we will cancel this week, 
uh, all the amount in order to reduce our exposure to dollars and also to use the leverage. 
So with this we finish the formal presentation now, we open the line to receive your questions. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, nows the time for the Q and A session. If you got uh, if you have a question, you can use the- the chat, or uh, the bottom label raise hand. 
We will take the questions in the order we receive them. 
If there is a question you can use the chat, or the raise hand. 
If there are no questions, we conclude this presentation and we turn back to Mr. Alejandro Elsztain CEO for his closing remarks. 
Thank you Santi. Uh, we are beginning, uh, very good season, big size, inaudible 
uh, having capital for buying more land in the region too, after the capital increases that we did last year. 
Um, we are growing, uh, so we think that's it's a very good mine too for agricultural division. Prizes have 
been much better terms than in the past and the margins are much higher. 
So we expect a very good season, 
and in the combination of real estate, having closed in the first quarter two big transactions. Give us a big, 
really good forcast of the annual result for the agricultural business operation. 
And in the case of the services, in the two cases in the field inaudible having the capital and the group 
inaudible its a team of more than 300 employees too. 
So we have the challenge of developing that e-commerce in the region. So really we are optimistic on the 21-22 now. 
So I would like to thank everyone and deserving to everyone have a very good week. Thank you very much.
