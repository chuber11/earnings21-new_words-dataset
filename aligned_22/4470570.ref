Thank you. Irina. And good morning and thank you for joining the call today. 
Our earnings during the thing quarter of 2021 were significantly higher than earning reported 
during the same period last year. 
These results were driven by considerably higher sales volumes and prices across almost all our business lines. 
We continue seeing very positive market conditions in all of the markets in which we participate. 
inaudible lithium market is exceeding our previous expectations. 
The iodine market has recovered from the pandemic faster than anticipated while we are also seeing a positive change in the fertilizer markets. 
We're now expecting that the lithium market demand should grow close to 50% this year, 
driven by strong sales of electric vehicles in all relevant markets, especially in China and Europe. 
inaudible expansions we have been working on are, are allowing us to grow even more than 
the market inaudible reached close to 100,000 metric tons in sales volume this year. 
By the middle of next year, our expansion, 280,000 metric tons should be ready, allowing us to keep on growing our sales volumes. 
This accelerating lithium market growth is pressuring prices. At the same, the contracts we signed last year are expiring. 
This allow us expect an average sales price, $112,000 per metric ton 
during the fourth quarter, and probably even higher during the first quarter next year. 
In the meanwhile, the iodine market demand has already reached the pre-pandemic levels. 
This quick recovery has had a positive impact on prices. Our supply has not been able to respond. 
We are now expecting total sales in 2021 around 12,500 metric tons, 
uh, with average sales prices increasing from prices seen over past few quarters. 
As we're working on expanding our iodine capacity, we expect to ramp up 
additional 1000 metric tons in the beginning of 2023 followed by approximately 2500 metric tons in 2024, 
all part of our early inaudible growth plan. 
We have seen some very interesting developments in the fertilizer markets globally. 
Supply has been impacted by expert restrictions and logistic interruption 
inaudible prices for both inaudible fertilizer have reached levels not seen in more than a decade. 
We now expect our potassium and potassium nitrate average prices to reach almost $700 
and over $ 1000 per metric ton inaudible during the fourth quarter, this year. 
Considering all the positive factors, 
we now anticipate a record performance during the fourth quarter this year with a significantly higher EBITDA. 
We remain confident in our ability to deliver future growth 
while continuing to operate in a sustainable way, creating value for our customers, communities, and all our stockholders. inaudible now open the line for questions. 
We will now begin the question and answer session. 
To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. 
If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. 
To withdraw your question, please star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. 
Our first question today comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ricardo, um, 
I'm gonna ask a few questions one by one. 
Um, when we look into your production for next year for lithium, um, you got to 120 already, LCE. You'll get to 180 at some point in next year. 
What do you think will be your ability for production next year? And inaudible your level of sales? 
Presumably, you wanna build some inventory. But what could be your maximum production or maximum sales next year? 
Thanks. Okay. Hi, Joel. Ricardo Ramos speaking now. 
About production, uh, as to total production, assuming that we are ramped up to the 180, during next year, we think it's reasonable to expect a production 
in the 140,000 metric tons next year. 
Maybe it's gonna be inaudible higher than that, but 140 inaudible my estimates today of the total lithium and lithium inaudible total production in Chile. 
About sales volumes, Pablo, what's your opinion? 
Yeah. Hello, 
Joel. inaudible to continue growing, uh, according to the demand. 
Uh, if we inaudible that with inaudible for the next year inaudible between 20 or 30%. We expect to grow inaudible in that same percentage. 
Okay. Now, I appreciate your pricing guidance. 
Now, you know, when I look at October Chilean customs data, 
your pricing in October seems well less than 12,000. You're gonna average about 12,000, you say, for the quarter. 
So, I wanna know, you know, if you expect to place so much more volume next. And presumably, you're now pricing volumes now for next year. Like, like, you're pricing volume… 
Pricing ahead for next year. 
How much, you know, how much of our pricing… How much of your volume in 2022 are you locking in now or will you expect to lock in by Christmas, let's say? 
And would you expect that pricing that… Any pricing you're locking in now for ' 22, is that all inaudible 12,000? Okay. 
Well, you know that today, we're in the middle of the negotiation for inaudible for the next year. 
However, what I can say, because you already that we, we have inaudible contract. 
But before the next year, we have, uh… And we need to negotiate closely to 80% of our total sales inaudible. to negotiate closely to the 80% of our total sales for the next year is open to, to discussions with our customers. 
So that's the percentage of the total volumes that is open for the next, for the next year. 
So right now today, 80% of your anticipated volume next year is open. Is that what you're saying? 
To- Today for the next year, okay, 20% is already negotiated inaudible different kind of contract with our customers. Right. 
And 80% is still open to have… uh, open to the conditions that we are, uh, uh, uh… that we need to discuss with our customers. Okay. 
And I appreciate that. And we can all see stock pricing from different Chinese and Asian benchmarks, be it 20,000 on carbon, $20,000 on carbon, $25,000 on carbon. 
Are those real prices that you can achieve at scale in the market for 2022, 
or is the answer, you know, it's much less than 25,000, but it's much more than 12,000? 
Like, help us understand how real some of those prices are we see in the 20s for real volume, real large volume, like you offer. 
You know that inaudible I know it's a question regarding prices, but what we need to remember is that depending of what you negotiate with your con- with your customers, it means 
shorter contracts, longer contracts, 
depending of the quality of the product, if it goes to battery, uh, uh, applications, industrial applications, 
then you have, uh, different prices. 
What I comment today is that because of the huge demand of lithium and lack of supply, the inaudible prices is today high. 
But it doesn't mean, uh, that we will see these kind of prices for the 
average price because again, it's, it's depending of the conditions that we negotiate with each, each customer. Thank you very much. 
Our next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Please, go ahead. 
Good morning, thank you for taking my questions, uh, hope everyone is doing well. Uh, I'll ask a few questions one by one, if that's okay. Uh, 
I guess the first question is just to extend off of Joel's question. You talked about 20% of 2022 volume is negotiated already and 80% is open. 
Can you just talk about the shape of that 80%? 
Um, how much of that 80% should be, uh, contracted by the end of this year? 
And, um, h- h- how do those contracts get renegotiated in each of the next kind of four or five quarters? 
Um, you know, are they all calendar 2022 contracts that will be negotiated before January 1st, or is it on a kind of continuous basis, some are short term, some, some are long term? 
Can you just give some more color in terms of when we expect that 80% to be, um, contracted? 
Okay. Well, uh, it is a difficult question because we are under negotiation. 
For sure that we know that when you are, uh, selling this amount of lithium, we need to secure that amount, 
but at… and also, it's up to each, I mean, every customer. 
Some customer, I mean, the, the rest of the 80% then will be a combination of closed shorter contracts, 
and for sure something that we are looking for if we are able to, to sign good contracts, we are also thinking to sign inaudible contracts. 
And normally, when you sign a inaudible contract, the negotiation process is longer than when you negotiate a shorter contract, 
so at the end, everything will depend how fast we can, we can do that with our customers. 
So today, I cannot really give you a fact, uh, number of how much of those contracts we will, we will inaudible. 
Anyhow, we are very close to the end of the year, so for sure inaudible is picked up by the end of the year, at least the first quarter should be, you know, already negotiated with our customers. 
Will 100% be finished by the end of Q1? I- 
I cannot say 100%, 
huh? But, uh, but m- m- most of it should be finished by the end of Q1, is that right? I mean, just based on the timing of, uh, the previous contracts and when they expire. I- I- I- I- 
Is that fair to say? 
Well, again, I mean, it depends 
for the inaudible market, but for sure, because of, of the period of the year that we have today, 
by the end of the year, we should have, uh, an important percentage already negotiated for Q1. 
Okay. That's, that's helpful. Thank you for that. 
Uh, next question is on, um, on iodine. 
You guys have, have tried different strategies over the years, uh, sometimes volume, sometimes price. 
Um, uh, with mixed success, uh, on the price side, and the volume side has been very successful. 
Now, we're getting above $35, or that's the direction that we're going, uh, per kilogram, and 
if I remember correctly, that's kind of the point in which you start to see, um, the economics look attractive for marginal producers in Chile to come online. 
Is that what you want? Do you want to see higher prices, or is that, um, getting a little bit dangerous, that you could see new capacity coming on? 
Can you kind of run us through what that debate looks like and kind of what your opinion is? 
Okay. Well, you know that, uh, I mean, in the industry, we need to consider different, uh, things, so one of them is inaudible demand. 
Uh, you know that this year, the recovery of the demand will be higher than expected, close to 12%. 
Then we need to consider the answer of the supply, 
so at the end, everything will depend of the inaudible of the lithium players in the supply, uh, uh, in the supply side. 
Uh, in that regard, uh, what we have seen is not a, uh… 
I mean, e- we have not seen, uh, uh, enough response of the supply in order to be able to supply all the demand that is today in the market. 
Uh, so price, if, you know, we struggle the supply and demand, 
um, everything will depend around how the different players will act with the supply plans, uh, in order to accomplish the demand that, that, that we have. 
Uh, just two more quick ones for me. Um, w- when you look at each of your, uh, business segments, 
can you talk about, um, uh, cost of production, whether it's iodine or NOP or potash or whatever it may be, 
um, and how that's been impacted by, uh, inflation, uh, cost inflation of raw materials, or labor, of energy? 
Are you seeing that, um, already or is that something that we should expect and be modeling, uh, uh, uh, for over the next few quarters? 
Uh, Ben, it's Ricardo Ramos speaking. Uh, if you, if you review our numbers 
during the first three quarters of this year, you'd see, uh, cost is slightly higher during third quarter than compared to the previous quarters. And 
I think that core costs today are, are affected by the exchange rate, for example, the exchange 
rate in Chile, are affected by the increased cost of raw material, a significant increase in cost of raw materials on, o- on our production process, 
the additional cost of the energy, as you may know. 
Contractors, of course, the contractors we have, they reflect the, the exchange rate, increased cost of raw materials, the energy and everything. 
Plus, we have to make sure of any cost in the last, I don't know, 18 months related to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected some way our cost. 
I think that 
it- it- 
it's already reflected. Some of it, yes, it will be some additional probably cost if, if situation of the raw materials and energy continue during the next few quarters, yes. 
But it seems that we are doing 
on the right thing in order to increase productivity, to increase the yields of our 
process in order to control the cost allocation. But, but so far, we are seeing, uh, every single product… producer in the world, these increased cost, that it's been affecting our production 
in the last twe- two or three quarters. 
Great. And then very last question if I may. Um, last quarter, you said that lithium demand was looking like it was gonna be up 40%, 
uh, and next year was… you know, you were thinking of around 20%. 
Now, you're saying lithium demand is gonna be up 50% this year, and that makes sense. 
But the, the question is, is that 50%, is that taking away some of the demand or are we seeing some demand acceleration c- uh, getting pulled from 2022? 
Or do you think 2022 will still be 20 or potentially even stronger? 
Uh, and, and, and then maybe as a followup, how do you think ' 25 will look? Are, are we still looking like it'll exceed, uh, one million, uh, tons, uh, or, or could it be a little bit higher? 
Okay, Ben. Uh, first of all, we, we need to remem- Okay when, uh, first of all, we- we need to remember that it's important the way 
for where we're starting to consider 20. We know that the demand was lower because of the crisis so that explains why we have this big growth this year. 
And we're growing from 40 to 50 percent the gross like we have seen with electric vehicles, well between very good and very positive. 
Actually today our- our forecast is inaudible it is the end of the year safe we be between 6.3 or 6.6 million. 
Which is bigger that what- than one expected. That's inaudible. 
And the other thing because we need to consider that some part of the lithium that we mine today is for the cars that we produce next year, also we are, 
uh, uh, we have a- a more positive feel from the growth of the- of the next year when I said today to you between 20 or 20 or 30 percent. 
That view is a little bit bigger than the view that we have, uh, before. 
So, we have some very, a positive outcome, yeah, at least in the short term. 
You got inaudible 2025? Well, we have different scenarios 
and we're basis values is one million inaudible of LCA 
which is bigger to- to- to- s, uh, to some indications that we gave the, uh, son a month ago. 
Uh, honestly we are working on a course that we are following up the market and potentially we could see better result. 
But it- b- but today we m- we- we main our view of the one inaudible. Thank you very much. 
Our next question comes from Goyern Paharneu with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. There are two questions actually. 
The first one on the Alaban business. 
If you could share a bit of- of the impact of the fire that, uh, took place in one of your plants and what was the impact in terms of costs 
during this quarter. And the second question on the fertilizer business. 
If you could share me in terms of the pricing that we are seeing on the market place and what do you expect, uh, going forward for the next year 
and all? Thank 
you. Hello Viamoto Gatoramo speaking. First of all, the- the fire we had in our, uh, facilities in the north, uh, three month ago, I think, 
uh, the impact in production was not more than 40- 40 tons because most of the production works 
was over and the next month. Um, finally, about the- uh, about the cost, yes. We had some additional cost. Probably in the range of $200,000. 
That arrangement, 
uh, means the improvement of the facility. Replacements of- o- o- of aci- er- uh, remove and replacement of equipment. Somebody in the 200, $250,000 total cost 
involving the fire. 
Uh, that's why it was not so relevant. 
And we have taken all the measures that they've kind of sufficient we not happen again. 
So very important, it's a- it's a significant issue for us having a fire in the facility. That's why we 
are, we really need to tell the situation and now we are better prepared for this kind of situation. 
About the fertilizer, uh, it's difficult to give you an outlook after the fourth quarter. We know now that fourth quarter 
unit is- is- is very unusual. Price levels that- th- that we are observing price levels that have not been recorded in previous years. 
Um, as I mentioned you, we are reaching inaudible hundred dollars for inaudible the potash. Close to 1000 dollars in potassium nitrate. 
I do not have, uh, a long term view. It's important today, it's important to consider that in the potash industry 
we are relatively small. Uh, current prices that th- the- th- that we are observ- that we have today reflect, I think, a temporary supply and demand situation. 
One good news in my opinion is that the demand- demand of the potash industry remains very strong. 
And that is as s- su- stated with the very prices of inaudible products. 
On the other hand, if the dif- difficulties of shipments push the prices up, 
it is very difficult for us to predict prices for next year. Definitely prices for fourth quarter is going to be very strong. 
Um, the situation is very difficult to predict in the long term. 
Anyway, it's important to consider that the case of potassium nitrate is different from the case of potassium chlorate. 
All the specialty fertilizers as- are less volatile, however, although with less volatility they follow in some ways the general potash prices. 
Thank you inaudible. 
Our next question comes from Corinne Blanchard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Hey, good morning everyone. 
Um, most of my question have been answered. But I just have a few, um, points to cover up, um, uh, follow-up question. The first one on, um, 
potassium, and, so your raise, uh, 2021 volume guidance to, um, close to 900 kilotons. 
Uh, which, uh, imply a significance, uh, catch up in four Q so if you could just comment on- on that catch up of four Q. 
And also how should we be thinking, um, in term of volume for 2022, 
like given the market conditions. Do you- do you still expect volume to decrease? Or would you expect, maybe, uh, a volume to stay close to- to 800 or 900 for- for next year? 
inaudible Gatoramo speaking. Uh, of course, due to the fact that the prices are extremely good in sterm as our prices they 
unique price environment. Today we are doing our best, uh, in order to increase the volumes 
due in fourth quarter. We're using some inventories of son in order to increase the volume dued in first- fourth quarter. 
That's why, probably if you put the numbers together, fourth quarter total volumes is close to 300,000 metric tons. 
Uh, very strong number with back to delivered dued in one quarter. 
That's 
an even lower probably depending the shipments. They s- they- they- they, uh, sometimes you have a delay of one or two shipments from fourth quarter to first quarter. You don't know yet because, uh, it- it will be decided at the end of the month. 
Depending the conditions at the port. 
But anyway, it's gonna be a really strong quarter because the price condition which had to push everything forward. 
It- it, about next year, I don't have now a forecast of volumes potash. Remember that we have a loss of production in inaudible and 
we use up some of the potash, m- most of the potash in the production of potassium nitrate. Either for fertilizer or solar soles business. 
That's why depending what's going to be our strategy en- specialty for fertilizer and solar soles next year, 
and the total production from the Solar Atacama, at the end you have a- at the end there's- the- the remaining is going to be the potash we will sell to the market. 
Anyway, as you may know, we are reducing ith- our commitment from the company to reduce the panting of solutions of the Solar, 
the most important reduction will be 2022 as compared to 2021. 
23, 24, 25, we will wa- we will have a small reductions every year. But the most important one is gonna be next year. 
Um, probably total production of potash at the Solar 
Atacama will be between 100 and 150,000 tons lower ne- from a total level close to 1.25 thousand me- one t- 1.25 million tons. 
We will move to 1.1 million tons probably production for next year. 
If you move forward with all the reductions because the- the- the reductions in panting will be in the range of 40,000 metric tons per year. 
But the first year is an important one, it's the 150. 
Uh, 100 and- 100, 150, we don't know yet exactly. 
We're improving. We're improving a lot the deal for the Solar level. That's why we expect it's gonna be closer to- to 200,000 reduction. Um, 
most of it, of course, will reflected in the potash industry because our first priority is to supply the potash for 
our nitrates and solar pol- uh, eh, potassium nitrate and solar soles 
business. All right. Thank you. Um, and just to come back, maybe. I say we come on, um, 
I need some pricing, um, what's your expectations to going forward and maybe 22, but maybe even beyond that- that time 
in term of, you know, considering maybe using, you know, a little bit of contract like short term, a little bit of long term and maybe switching to some sales, um, sort. 
Like do you- do you consider maybe switching at some point to a more hybrid model, uh, for pricing like some of your peers are doing that? Or do you rather, 
uh, uh, you know, stick to more to- to contract and inaudible agreement for- Um, you know, take inaudible contract and inaudible for most of the volume. 
Okay. What we inaudible the expectation of profits for the next year, eh, we see a strong demand, a- as we already said. 
Uh, however, you know, the inaudible supply and demand, so everything else will depend on the reaction of the supply. 
We know that there are other projects, eh, under development, so everything at the end will depend on how, uh, the supply can react to the demand. 
Anyhow, we are really positive on the demand side. Uh, but we need to see what happens within the next year, but w- we should expect pos- a positive, uh, trend. 
Regarding to the, to the strategy of contract inaudible is something that we have, we have said before. 
Eh, we are open inaudible with our customers 
inaudible which is to give to our customers the solutions that they, they need. Uh, in the past we have announced inaudible agreements. 
We are under discussions of different contract with our customers, but at the end, what we are looking for always is to have good contracts for both sides. 
So we are open finally to have a mixed strategy between short and long term, 
uh, long term contracts. Okay, thank you. That's inaudible. And then the last one, if you, do you have any updates on the inaudible like any update for the inaudible project in Australia? 
Yeah, well, um, well, as you know, at the end of the year we announced we finally met with officials, so from there we are doing a good project. 
We have started the early, uh, construction stage in both sites. That means the refinery in inaudible and the Mulholland where we inaudible plan. And so 
far so good, according to the, to the plan. So everything is, is going well. 
inaudible thank you, inaudible. Our last question today will come from Cesar Perez-Novoa, with BTG Pactual. Please go ahead. 
Yes, um, good morning, uh, or good afternoon to everyone. 
Um, some of my questions have already been answered. Perhaps I have, uh, weak connectivity here, but, 
uh, m- my questions would be what supply conditions, uh, does SGMC and the lithium market in general, uh, for, for next year, considering that new volume 
won't come on stream for several producers, including yourself? 
Uh, second, I am fully aware management provides n- no pricing outlook. 
However, most, uh, lithium benchmarks are hovering, uh, a- around two times, uh, SGM's indicated, uh, fourth quarter price. 
The question being, 
in, in terms of direction, uh, where would your, uh, realized price be, or, if that should come, uh, closer to that already embedded in the spot market, 
uh, considering that, uh, if I, if I heard correctly, 80% of your contracts are yet to be, u- uh, closed, uh, possibly in the first quarter of next year? 
Any qualitative assessment there would be greatly appreciated. 
Hello? Okay. Yeah. Okay, Cesar, eh, Pablo speaking. 
Regarding to 
your question about conditions in lithium markets, eh, as I said before, we are, we are really positive about that. Uh, as I told you, we see, uh, uh, growth for the next year between 20 and 30 percent, and that mainly explained inaudible penetration. Eh, as 
I said before, uh, the inaudible for the year, we expect they will be between 6.3 and 6.6 million. 
For the next year we see that the number will be close to 9 million, so we see that the inaudible will continue growing. 
So we are really positive, eh, ab- about the market. 
Uh, em, and we don't have any, any doubts about that. We see strong fundamentals of the lithium demand. 
Um, regarding to the new supply 
inaudible, eh, I think that it's good to see that new projects are, are coming, 
in the sense that in order to be able to supply this amount, this huge amount of demand, it's good for the industry. 
So we expect that important players will continue with expansion plans that they also have announced. Like us. 
So that, that's what we see. 
And finally, regarding to the, to the project, 
well, it's really again, it's really difficult to, to inaudible any 
forecast about that because you see that the market is, 
is, is moving so fast, it's changed so fast, that any price prediction I could say that it's difficult to, to do. 
Eh, what we gonna do is to try again to secure volumes with our customers, negotiating good conditions from, uh, each party, 
in order to secure, you know, a long term offer to our customers. 
All right, thank you very much. And then if I may, uh, squeeze one more question there, 
um, maybe, maybe you answered this before, but have you given any cap ex guidance for 2022? 
Yeah, eh, inaudible cap ex for next year, inaudible to say, 
w- we, we did not inaudible the cap ex in the last 30 days or 60 days inaudible forecast we had at the beginning of the year. 
And if I'm not wrong it's close to $500 million, those, for 2022. And- Thank you. crosstalk cap ex for inaudible was previously announced. mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
All right, thank you Ricardo. And thank you everyone, Pablo, thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Irea… Irena Acshonova, Investor Relations, for any closing remarks. 
Um, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to having you at our next call. Have a great day, everyone. Good bye.
