Welcome to Ecopetrol's earnings conference call, in which we will the main financial and operational results for the third quarter 2021. 
All lines have been muted. There will be a Q&A session at the end of the presentation. 
Before we begin, it is important to mention that the comments in this call by Ecopetrol's senior management include projections of the company's future performance. 
These projections do not constitute any commitment as to future results, nor do they take into account risks or uncertainties that could materialize. 
As a result, Ecopetrol assumes no responsibility in the event that future results are different from the projections shared in this conference call. 
The call will be led by Mr. Felipe Bayon, CEO of Ecopetrol; 
Alberto Consuegra, COO; and Jaime Caballero, CFO. Thank you for your attention. Mr. Bayon, you may begin your conference. 
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 
During this quarter, we continued to deliver record results. As of September, we are now consolidating Interconexion Electrica ISA's financial statement. 
We generated revenues of COP23 .3 trillion and EBITDA of COP10 .4 trillion, and net income of COP3 .8 trillion. 
These results highlight our successful commercial strategy, which has allowed us to capture the favorable conditions of international crude oil prices. 
We achieved important progress in our strategic agenda with the accomplishment of milestones such as the following: 
the closing of ISA's acquisition and the first consolidation of its financial results into the results of the Ecopetrol Group, 
materializing this transformational step in our energy transition and decarbonization program; 
our first liability management transaction for $2 billion through the issuance of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds 
to partially prepay the loan disbursed to finance ISA's acquisition; 
the authorization granted by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia to subscribe the program for the issuance and placement of common stocks 
enabling Ecopetrol, during five years, to execute simultaneous issuance 
within the local and international markets, providing flexibility and opportunity in our capital structure strategy. 
And now, more than 86% of our employees have completed their immunization against COVID-19. 
Let's move on to the next slide. With the acquisition of the controlling stake in ISA, 
the Ecopetrol Group turns into a leading company in the energy sector of the region, participating across the hydrocarbon value chain, 
energy transmission, renewable energy self-generation, and infrastructure. 
After the closing of the transaction, our efforts have been focused on ensuring compliance 
with legal and regulatory requirements related with accounting consolidation, reporting, and financial planning. 
We have made progress in matters regarding corporate governance, such as the election of ISA's new Board of Directors, following its AGM, held on October 22. 
The new composition of the board will allow Ecopetrol to exercise as controlling party over the company. 
Also, I would like to highlight that, 
for market reporting purposes, ISA's financial results are now incorporated as a new business line in addition to the existing business segments. 
ISA will maintain its value promise and independence, as we have done with the rest of our subsidiaries. 
ISA will bring to the table experience and knowledge that will boost new growth opportunities. 
We are progressing a gradual integration process led by the transition management office, a multidisciplinary team from both companies. 
This process involves neutral and detailed knowledge between both companies, understanding of both business models, and the construction of a shared vision. 
After having consolidated an orderly transition, we'll pursue opportunities that allow accelerating the capture of value from our investments. 
We see potential synergies in opportunities such as energy and fuel storage, development of new and additional renewable energy projects, 
generation and commercialization of energy in other countries, 
and growth opportunities in the hydrocarbon business in geographies where ISA already operates. 
I will now pass on the floor to Alberto Consuegra, who will elaborate on the main operating results for this quarter. 
Thank you, Felipe. I will start by highlighting the discovery of hydrocarbons after drilling the exploratory well Liria YW12, 
which confirmed the presence of gas and 49-degree Apiay light oil in a new structure near the Cupiagua field, 
a milestone that sets the company's exploratory reactivation in Piedemonte, where Ecopetrol is an operator. 
We also highlight the commerciality of Boranda and Flamencos-1 discoveries, which 
are part of the near-field exploration strategy, which seeks production and reserves incorporation in the short term. 
Discoveries are located in Santander Department 
and have produced about 94,000 barrels of crude oil for Ecopetrol's share during the testing stage between January and September of the current year. 
We continue our international exploratory strategy. 
During the 17th round of the Brazilian Oil and Gas Agency, 
the consortium between Ecopetrol Brazil and Chile acquired this S-M- 1709 
block located in the Santos Basin, expanding the portfolios among high 
potential areas with competitive break-evens close to $40 per barrel. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
The quarterly production was 683,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 
22,700 more than the volume achieved in the second quarter. 
Despite achieving the production stabilization of the fields, affected by blockages and also increasing gas sales, milestones of the plan previously announced, 
there were two climate events during the quarter that limited an additional recovery in the growth of our production. 
Abroad, the hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico caused the closure of wells. And in Colombia, the rainy season caused land slides, which affected the Promioriente Gas Pipeline, 
as well as the flooding of the Caricare field, causing its temporary closure for 20 days. 
Other weather impacts were related to increasing power outages. 
These events impacted production in and around 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect a production around 700, 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 
mainly leveraged in the drilling of between 110 wells and 130 wells, 
the reactivation of the Promioriente Gas Pipeline, and the continuity of the operation of the Nare asset, which we received on November 4th, 
after ending the association contract, 
adding an average of 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
However, some risks associated with climate and public order issues remain and could affect production levels. 
Gas and LPG contributed 21% to total production, 
highlighting the signing of the Santiago de las Atalayas Gas Exploitation and Exploration Agreement with the National Hydrocarbons Agency, 
which allowed the beginning of pre-drilling activities in two new wells in the Piedemonte area. 
Given the effects on gas production due to maintenance and climatic events, 
a commercial strategy was developed to guarantee gas supply at nationwide, along with the Ministry of Mines and Energy and market agents through the signing of contingency contracts. 
On the social front, new gas and LPG connections have been made, 
allowing near 5,000 new families from Strata-1 and 2 to have this service and improve their quality of life between January and September. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
2021 has been a challenging year in terms of production due to all the factors that we have revealed throughout the year, 
which have mainly affected the basic curve. 
Resuming activity on our wells generated higher levels of water versus oil content with a gradual stabilization. 
The pandemic and public order situations affected our projects in terms of supply chain, delivery deadlines, and execution. 
This has been partially offset by the implementation 
of initiatives such as anticipation of 2022 work fronts and strengthening of our commercial gas strategy, 
with which we expect to restore our growth path. 
Given all the above, projected production levels for 2021 would be around 680,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
On unconventionals, we highlight that on July 8th, 
the first territorial dialogue was held for the Platero Comprehensive Research Pilot Project. 
And on October 29th, an environmental impact study was filed, requesting approval of the license for the drilling of Kale. 
In parallel, progress is being made in the documentation of Platero's environmental study in synergy with what has been filed for Kale. 
In August, a public survey was carried out by the National Consulting Center in the area of influence of the pilots, 
evidencing a positive change in perception among communities regarding the industry and the unconventional 
pilots, Ecopetrol being the oil company that generates the most confidence. 
In September, Ecopetrol started the operation of a mobile environmental laboratory 
for the Magdalena Medio region, so that communities have a better knowledge of the environmental variables present in their surroundings and that will allow once the pilot starts to monitor their behavior. 
Abroad, Permian reached a gross production level for Ecopetrol of 24,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, 
evidencing the ramp-up of unconventional with a cumulative EBITDA margin of 83%. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
The transported volume of refined products increased 63,000 barrels per day 
compared to the third quarter of 2020, 
thanks to the recovery of local demand, mainly the Galan-Sebastopol trench, by supplying the large consumption areas of the country. 
On the other hand, the volume of crude oil transported decreased by 30,000 barrels per day compared to the same quarter of last year as a result of lower production, driven by the previously mentioned causes. 
In order to secure the evacuation of the Cano Limon field, 11 reversal cycles of the Bicentenario Pipeline were carried out. Finally, 
I want to mention that the consolidation agreement between Frontera, CENIT, and Bicentenario was approved by the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca 
to solve the existing disputes regarding the transportation of crude oil in Colombia. 
As a result of the conciliation, Frontera will recognize to CENIT and Bicentenario the outstanding obligations under their agreements as of December 31st, 2019. 
Frontera will transfer to CENIT its 43.03% interest in Bicentenario, 
and will transfer to Bicentenario the pending 
dividends, the funds deposited in their trust, as guaranteed for one of the disputes, 
the advanced payments from prior years under Bicentenario Pipeline line field that they have. 
As part of the agreement, Frontera will recognize to Bicentenario a portion of the Bicentenario syndicate loan in the amount of COP438 billion. 
Additionally, CENIT and Bicentenario signed new ship-or-pay agreements with Frontera, 
allowing them to receive additional revenues for the payment of obligations included in the conciliation for a value of up to $92 million, subject 
to adjustments as per the value of the line field. 
Likewise, ODL, a CENIT subsidiary, obtained execution with Frontera of a new ship-or-pay agreement, 
which shall allow ODL to receive additional income up to $55.5 million. 
The financial impacts of the transaction 
correspond to the total recovery of outstanding debt as of December 31st, 2019, for a value of COP729 billion. 
The one-time impact on EBITDA will be approximately COP700 billion, which will be reflected in the figures for the fourth quarter of this year. 
Additionally, financial revenues for approximately COP41 billion will be received 
due to the effect of default interest and returns on trust funds. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
We achieved an accumulated EBITDA record result as of September of COP2 .35 trillion, thanks to selling of inventories and benefit from market prices at Barrancabermeja Refinery, essentials, commercial strategies, and an Invercolsa's increase in natural gas sales, 
which contribute to mitigate impacts derived from operational challenges and keeping the cash cost of the segment under control. 
Additionally, we are pleased to inform that we achieved the delivery of gasoline at 50 parts per million contemplated by regulation for January 2022. 
The integrated gross margin of the refineries remain at pre-pandemic levels, 
despite having a more expensive diet, because the recovery of Brent price, a challenging scenario for the realization of valuable products, especially in the Cartagena refinery, due to the discount on export diesel 
and the scheduled maintenance of the petrochemical train and the alkylation unit at the Barrancabermeja refinery. 
The consolidated throughput in September was about 365,000 barrels per day, exceeding the throughput restrictions on the refineries 
affected by public order events at Cano Limon Covenas oil pipeline, 
and electrical contingency presented in August, and corrective maintenance planned in the catalytic tracking unit at Cartagena's refinery. 
These events had an EBITDA impact of COP121 billion. 
A shutdown plan is being implemented with the purpose of improving the reliability of the refineries, 
which will take the operational availability from 92.5% in 
2019 
to 94.2% in 2021, and up to international reference levels above the 96% in 2024. 
Other scheduled maintenance for the flare in plants 1 and 2 in Esenttia will, will be occurring. 
Let's move on to the next slide, please. 
At the end of third quarter, we have delivered efficiencies close to COP1 .8 trillion, 
highlighting a reduction of the dilution factor, energy efficiency, and savings obtained with the renewable energies. 
The total unit cost accrued to September increased $10.3 per barrel as compared to the same period in 2020, 
mainly due to higher purchase and import costs associated with higher Brent prices. 
On the other hand, the cumulative lifting cost to September 
increased $0.87 per barrel as compared to the same period in 2020, reaching $8 per barrel. 
Such anticipated increase is due to greater numbers of well interventions, 
the execution of process safety and integrity work included in the plan. as well as increasing the cost of oil services due to industry inflation. 
By the end of the year, we expect to have a lifting cost in the order of $8.50 per barrel. 
The cost per barrel transported showed a slight decrease as compared to the same period in 2020, reaching $2.9 per barrel, 
thanks to the control of variable costs, given the lower volumes transported. 
The refining cash cost accumulated to September showed a downward trend as compared to previous years, correlated to gas composition and its supply chain. 
I will open the floor to Jaime Caballero, who will talk to you about the main financial results of the Ecopetrol Group. 
Thanks, Alberto. During the nine months ended in September 2021, Ecopetrol's net income reached COP10 .6 trillion, 
exceeding more than nine times the results obtained during the same period of the previous year. 
This increase is mainly explained by a higher EBITDA generation of COP15 .5 trillion, where the following factors stand out: 
a positive net effect of COP13 trillion due to realization prices, higher crude oil spreads, and foreign exchange increase for purchases and sales; 
a positive valuation of inventories for COP4 .2 trillion related 
to market prices and increasing ships in transit to India and the U.S. given the new delivery at place commercial strategy; 
and the consolidation of 100% of ISA's EBITDA, COP4 .7 trillion, corresponding to one month of operation after closing the acquisition. 
The above was partially offset by lower volume purchases and sales for one- That by lower volume of purchases and sales for 1.5 trillion pesos 
affected by schedule and corrected maintenance activities within the refineries. 
Higher operating activity costs for 0.6 trillion pesos, mainly associated to maintenance and higher materials consumption as a result of the economic reactivation. 
And other effects in the EBITDA for 0.4 trillion pesos, 
mainly related to the increase in exploratory expenses, recognition of public work provisions and environmental provisions among other aspects. 
Likewise, the year to date includes the impact of three non-operational items. 
The non-recurring positive effect of 0.4 trillion recognized in January for the divestment of Savia Peru, 
a negative variation from other non-cash items for 1.8 trillion, 
including foreign exchange effect, depreciation, 
taxes, financial expenses, and ISAs non-controlling interest for 0.7 trillion and 1 trillion in other subsidy areas. 
An increase in the income tax provision as a result of higher financial results and related to deferred tax restatement for 36 billion pesos. 
After implementing the new rate established by the tax reform in Columbia, from 30% to 35%. 
These results show a clear continuity of the favorable trend in the company's financial results. Please turn to the next slide to see ISAs main financial results. 
For the third quarter and the nine months ended on September, 2021. 
ISAs EBITDA continues its growth trend, increasing 5.8% and 5.2% respectively as compared to the same periods in 2020. 
Net income decreased affected by non-recurring events, 
such as cost-associated to the liability management transaction at Interchile, which also included the unwind of debt hedging for a total of 273 billion pesos 
and a higher deferred tax expense of 146 billion pesos due to the application of the rates from the tax reform in Columbia. 
In the absence of these impacts ISAs net income for the quarter would have been 541 billion and 1.6 trillion year 
to date. ISAs consolidation in Eco Patrol Group is carried out through a business combination of control businesses has defined in IFRS 3. 
A new segment has been established to incorporate ISAs standalone results, starting September, and the expenses related to the debt raise to complete the acquisition. 
ISAs contribution is material for the Eco Patrol Group, and it will be progressively incorporated over the next accounting period. 
When normalizing the consolidation for the nine months ended in September 
ISAs contribution to the EBITDA would have been 5.3 trillion, representing about 19% of the total. 
The net income contribution would have been 0.6 trillion pesos and 0. 8 trillion, excluding the non-recurring events mentioned above. 
After consolidation, assets and liabilities of the Eco Patrol Group increased by 82 and 55 trillion pesos, respectively. 
Total equity increased by 27 trillion pesos reflecting the concept of non-controlling interest associated to ISA. 
The values of assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests as well as goodwill are preliminary and will be updated to final amounts by the end of the year. 
Please turn to the next slide, to see the main financial KPIs. 
Cumulative financial indicators year to date reaffirm Eco Patrol's ability to capture the favorable price environment 
as well as the initial benefits from ISA after consolidating the first month of its operations since the acquisition. 
In the oil and gas business is worth to highlight the EBITDA per barrel, that reach record levels of $40.20 per barrel, and quality the results of $40. 10 per barrel. 
These levels compare very favorably with other industry peers. 
Net income break even, continues to improve as compared to the end of 2020. 
And the same period of the previous year, reaching $34.80 per barrel. Thanks to the recovery of broad spread and higher throughput in the refineries. 
Regarding ISAs results. It is worth to highlight the EBITDA margin, excluding construction that was 77.7% aligned with 2020. 
ISAs return on equity for the barrel was affected by the liability management transaction effect that did not impact the group results 
due to the extent that it corresponds to an event prior to the acquisition. And therefore it was registered as ugly. 
Year to date, EBITDA margin for the Eco Patrol Group was 46.7%. Among the highest levels historically surpassing pre-pandemic levels. 
The leverage ratio of the Eco Patrol Group is similar to 2020 levels when incorporating ISAs debt and one month EBITDA. 
Normalizing with this EBITDA for the last 12 months, the indicator would have been 2.4 times. 
Please turn to the following slide to see the main highlights of the commercial strategy and its contribution to the financial results. 
The commercial strategy has been fundamental to the successful capture of value in the current environment. 
The stable quality of our blends, supply reliability and contractual flexibility are fundamental to the corporate strategy. 
As of September, 2021, the realization price of our crude basket increased from representing 
76% to 94% as compared to the average rent price for the same period in 2020. 
It is worth highlighting the increase in barrels delivered to destinations such as South Korea, India, Brunei, Sweden, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, going from 17% in 3Q 2020 to 37.5% in 3Q 
2021 in volumetric terms. 
This strategy has allowed a higher commercial margin as compared to shipments sold and delivered at the inaudible. 
Likewise, we continued to maximize the value of crude oil and products through asset-backed trading strategies with an incremental benefit of $47 million by the end of September, 
almost twice the amount achieved during full year 2020. 
We estimate that so far this year, the commercial effort has contributed around $339 million. 
Equivalent to a dollar and 19 cents per barrel. To the Eco Patrol's Group EBITDA. 
As a result of export strategies, purchase of new crudes for the refineries, benefits from using our crudes and savings from energy efficiencies among others. 
Sales of gas and LPG, a key element of the strategy contributed almost $15 per barrel to the EBITDA, 
proving the relevance of this product within the company's results. 
Let's turn to the next slide please. 
Organic investment as of N3Q amounted to nearly $2.2 billion showing an important recovery versus the previous year, 
despite global supply chain disruptions, public unrest in certain areas of our operation and longer regulatory permitting lead times. 
The upstream segment accounted for 77% of total organic CapEx, 
with a focus on increasing production on reserves. While 23% went to the midstream downstream and corporate segments. 
By the end of the year, we expect to invest between $3.3 and $3.5 billion. 
CapEx execution for the fourth quarter will be focused on an increase in drilling rigs directly operated by Eco Patrol, in securing the arrival and materials with supply delays, 
boosting activity in Permian Eco Patrol, America and Okol and an increase in activity in the refineries. 
As for ISAs CapEx, its cumulative execution as of September was $946 million. 
Mainly allocated to the progress in the construction of energy transmission projects in the countries where the company operates. 
ISA estimates, a year end execution of sector $1.2 billion. Please turn to the next slide to review the company's cash flow. 
Cash balance for the third quarter was 13.1 trillion pesos. With the operating cash flow adding 11.5 trillion pesos. 
ISA contributed 6 trillion pesos to the cash balance and 0.5 trillion to the operating cash flow, respectively. 
The investment component for the year presented an outflow of 8.8 trillion pesos related to CapEx. 
The financing component, excluding ISA acquisition, registered an outflow of 2.8 trillions pesos for principal and interest payments. 
During 2021, dividends for 1.4 trillion have been paid to Eco Patrol shareholders and to non-controlling shareholders of its subsidiaries. 
Final cash balance, considers cash and cash equivalence for 10.1 trillion pesos and a short-term investment portfolio of 3 trillion pesos. 
The Eco Patrol Group's cash composition is 64% dollar-based and 36% Columbian peso-based. 
This cash balance does not include the account receivable from the full price deviation fund, 
for pe- for it's a Spanish acronym, which at the end of 3Q amounts to 7.2 trillion pesos. 
It is worth mentioning that the recently approved general budget of the Republic of Columbia 
includes a specific provision of 2.7 trillion pesos for the recognition of this item, 
as well as additional budgetary mechanisms to address the remaining amounts. 
Please turn to the next slide. 
Finally, we would like to highlight the completion of our first external liability management transaction for $2 billion, by which we partially refinance the 3.7 billion loan associated with the ISA acquisition. 
This transaction optimizes the debt maturity profile of the Eco Patrol Group, with market rates at historically low levels since 2014. 
The transaction had a robust demand from around 270 investors from different geographies globally 
with individual bids of up to $470 million. Evidencing confidence in Eco Patrols financial strength. 
This transaction, in addition to the approval of the program to issue common stock in Columbia, by the Superintendency of Finance, provides flexibility and access to different sources of debt and equity financing 
with the objective to continue optimizing the maturity profile and to fund the energy transition strategy of the company. Now I hand over to the CEO for closing remarks. 
Thank you, Hyman. We continue to move forward on each of the pillars of our TESG strategy. 
On the environmental side, we particularly highlight achievements in our renewable energy projects 
with the entry to operation of the San Fernando solar farm that is located in the Meta department, 
we have now an additional install capacity of 61 Megawatts that will supply part of the energy demand for both Eco Patrol and sending operations. 
It will also help us to avoid emissions for more than 508,000 tons of CO2 equivalent during the next 15 years 
and will contribute to the group's decarbonization plan. 
All this in addition to over 21,000 tons of CO2 emissions 
that have already been avoided by the Castilla solar farm in its first to use of operations since October, 2019. 
During such period, we have also saved with the Castilla Solar Farm, some $2 million in operational costs. 
With San Fernando, the group's current capacity on renewable energy stands at 112 Megawatts. 
Likewise, Eco Patrol inaugurated the gas based self-generation plant in Chichi 
Meme that will avoid emissions of some 44,000 tons of CO2 each year and will supply part of the energy required by the Chichi Meme apply 
CPO9 and Castilla yield all located in the Meta department. 
In terms of hydrogen, we highlight the active participation of Eco Patrol as one of the key players in the construction of Colombia's hydrogen roadmap 
aimed at developing this energy source for the country. 
On the other hand, we recently joined the group of the task force of on nature related financial disclosures, 
TNFD to help develop a reporting framework for nature related risk and opportunities, as well as mitigating negative impacts on the environment. 
Last week, we participated in COP26 in Glasgow as one of the organizations representing Colombia. 
In addition to discussing actions that allow to mitigate climate change impact, 
we met with different leading organizations to explore potential alliances in the development of several opportunities on our road to net zero and energy position roadmaps. 
Regarding technology, I wanna highlight the capture of some $36 million year to date of benefits from our digital transformation agenda. 
Also, the award of the sustainable development goals, good practices led by the global compact of the UN to our open innovation program, a hundred times a hundred. 
In the social dimension 
Eco Patrol achieved the Equipares Silver Seal, a certification with a 98.47% score, 
which gives us now five companies in the group that have favorable processes for gender equality. 
Let's move on now to the conclusions. 
During the quarter, we achieved significant progress towards energy transition, such as the closing of the ISA acquisition, 
setting a milestone 
in the history of the country and for both companies. 
Providing the opportunity to consolidate the Eco Patrol Group as a new leading energy company with greater capacity to continue generating sustainable value. 
We continue delivering strong financial results to our shareholders and our groups of interest. 
We will keep consolidating our integrated strategy, maintaining the focus on the core business while moving forward in the pillars of energy transition. 
Thanks to everyone for participating today in the call. And now I will open up for the Q and A session. 
Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, simply press star, and then one on your telephone keypad. 
If you would like to withdraw your question, please press the pound key. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster. 
We have a question from Keller Levy from Morgan Stanley. 
Hi. Hello everyone. Uh, thank you for taking my questions. Uh, I have two questions. Uh, the first one is on leaping costs. Uh, so I, 
I just wanted to, uh, to understand your expectations, uh, for deep line going forward. Uh, when we consider both, uh, recovering production and higher audit prices, 
uh, that are expected to, to remain, uh, into the next quarters. 
Uh, if we should continue to, to expect listing costs close to the, uh, $8 per the inaudible 
range, uh, and if the company's already seeing some level of industry cost inflation. 
Uh, and then the, the second question, uh, is on, on the production expectations for, uh, 2022. Uh, 
I just wanted to, to pick a bring and, and try to understand what sort of projects, uh, can be anticipated at the current oil price environment. 
Uh, and also how much the, the Shao JV in the U.S. could, uh, contribute to the group, uh, in this is strong oil price environment? Thank you very much. 
Yeah. Thanks. And thanks for participating today in the, uh, in the conference call. 
So, um, I'll give you some context and then, uh, I'll ask Alberto 
to provide more detail. Uh, first around, uh, lifting cost and then around, uh, production. 
So, uh, first thing around lifting cost, if you look at where we ended up on 3Q around $8 per barrel, 
uh, we are signaling that the year should end up in around, uh, or at around eight and a half dollars per barrel. 
And for next year, the range should be around nine and a half to $10 per barrel. 
So that's sort of the expectations. 
So clearly, we see there will be, there will be an, um, an increment or an increase, uh, in terms of the lifting cost. 
Alberto will provide detail around levels of activity. 
And also some of the, uh, the pressures we are 
seeing from some of the, uh, fast, uh, increases, uh, in terms of, uh, sector inflation, and particularly around some materials and the likes. 
So he'll talk about that. 
In terms of, uh, of production, I'll, I'll share my view with you. And then again, Alberto will provide some detail, but if you look at what has happened this year, 
uh, we started at, uh, 1Q at 676. 
We went down to 661 in 2Q and up to 684 in 3Q. 
So there's a recovery. We are, uh, we're seeing recovery from some of the… So there's a recovery. We're, uh, we're seeing recovery from some of the issues, operational issues that we had in inaudible. 
Especially with, uh, the production of water in some other regions. And some of the, uh, the blockages and, and stoppages, civil unrest in country. 
Eh, we expect that in 4Q, we, we will be at around 700,000 barrels. A- 
The way I would describe it is that we're seeing a recovery, there, there's a clear path of recovery. But it's taking longer than we had anticipated. 
So that, I think that's message number one. 
We're currently working on the numbers for 2022. We don't have a number yet in terms of where we… Conference Center. 
Please be prepared to provide the confirmation number, or host and company of the conference you wish to attend. Please stand by, and an operator will be with you shortly. Thank you for waiting. Confirmation number for your call? 
Your name, please? 
Thank you, here's your-… inaudible, 
um, in the, in the core business. Thank you. 
Thanks, Matthews. And I, I'll start with ESOP, and then I'll hand over to Walter to talk about the downstream. 
So, eh, in terms of ESOP, eh, I wanna provide a bit of context. We, we had something called a TMO, the Transition Management Office. 
It's basically comprised of some, eh, 80 people. Roughly half and half from each of the organizations. 
Has been working, eh, for some months now. And for the last, uh, eh, two and a half months since we closed the deal on the 20th of August, 
eh, a dedicated team has been, eh, 
posed, uh, on the premise, on premises, mainly, eh, working on, eh, some 10 to 12, um, streams of work 
mainly. So there's different things. You know, and we've talked about, eh, the legal versus regulatory, the, uh, financial consolidation. So we'll work now on things like, uh, budget and finance, 
eh, plan, planning, sorry, planning purposes. And so there's a lotta work. 
And, uh, and that's actually going quite well. 
Eh, in terms of, uh, eh, Heimi and myself joining the board. 
That's already happened. So I, I just wanted to provide sort of the high level context, eh, in terms of, uh, where we are. 
Some things that we're looking at, 
and there's, uh, some very, eh, tactical, pragmatical things that we're looking at. So for example, 
eh, uh, in a lot of the, uh, eh, things in which we operate, eh, for example on a digital, 
eh, we have a, a lot of synergies and opportunities. Because we use the same providers. 
You know, and we can share some of the conditions and, uh, some of the favorable conditions that EcoPetrol has, eh, on contracting, some of these services. 
And those can be passed through to inaudible. 
So that's low hanging fruit where we're early, very early on inaudible have identified. 
And there's some ongoing work between the teams around things like innovation and technology, very important. 
So things like when you mention power generation. So, 
eh, in Colombia by the current existing regulation, 
eh, since we are in transmission, we would not be allowed to enter the power generation market to sell to third parties. 
So that's the current, eh, sort of regulatory priority in Colombia. 
Having said that, there's opportunities in the other countries where we na- now have a presence. So that's, that's inaudible number one. 
That in terms of, uh, things like a- additional, eh, renewable power, power generation projects from renewable sources, 
there's a lot of opportunity. Both in country, and outside 
in terms of energy storage, 
which is fundamental as we think about the transition and, and sort of ensuring that there's reliability in terms of the se- eh, of the provision of electricity, 
you know? To, uh, to the, uh, to the consumers. 
Eh, even in things like, eh, hydrogen and things like low emission energy. So, eh, the teams are actually working on that. 
So, uh, we're very, um, enthusiastic I would say, in terms of, uh, eh, the new opportunities. And there's a lot of things that are coming up from those conversations. 
And, uh, eh, what we'd like to do Matthews, is that, uh, as soon or as long as we're progressing and advancing, we'll continue to communicate. 
You know, in terms of, 
uh, eh, where we are, how we, how we planned it, some of those, uh, 
opportunities that, um, I, I would end up saying there before inaudible to, to inaudible is that, eh, 
I don't think we fully understand, eh, the potential that we can unlock, 
you know, in terms of the transaction that we've done, and opportunities going, going forward. 
So, uh, one thing, why don't we move into the downstream to talk a little bit more about the margins and, uh, and what do we see going forward. 
Thank you, Fillipe. Thank you, Filipe. And thank you, Matthew for your question on the inaudible business. Uh, 
I will start, uh, mentioning that, uh, as you saw on the slide, uh, uh, I think wa- was covered by Roberto, 
that, eh, as of September, we have accumulated a record of eight a- of ₱2.3 billion, eh, for the segment. 
So this is mainly coming from external inaudible result in the second quarter. 
Regarding the inaudible quarter, uh, important to mention that we inaudible, uh, around, 
uh, July, eh, and August, planned activities at the Barrancabermeja Refinery. 
Eh, mainly in the regulation you need, and, eh, the petrochemical, uh, business. 
Those activities, uh, Barranca will continue, uh, th- for those has already been completed. Uh, 
although the Barrancabermeja, uh, we have inaudible right now, eh, eh, maintenance, uh, major maintenance on the co- one of the core unit, and on the FCC. 
Eh, in the case of Cartagena, the result of the third quarter were impacted by, eh, the, eh, a blackout event that we had in, uh, August. 
Eh, and also, a, a maintenance that we need to do at the FCC unit in August, and finished in the middle of September. 
So at the Cartagena refinery, those were 
one-time events, both of them. Um, and, you know, the refinery, eh, where we cover for those events, um, is running close to, to full range right now. 
And at the Cartagena refinery, we are projecting the fourth quarter, 
eh, we are not projecting to have a planned, eh, turnarounds or, or big maintenance, uh, at the Cartagena refinery in the fourth quarter. 
So we see Cartagena for the fourth quarter, eh, coming up in term of, uh, margins. 
Eh, and at the Barranca as I mentioned, we are executing the, the pra- the, eh, a planned turnaround for the crew unit of the FCC. 
But margin for the Barranca are planned to be as steady for the fourth quarter, and maybe similar to the third quarter. 
So in overall for the refining, we are projecting to finish, eh, 2021. 
Eh, in regarding, eh, 
inaudible rate, eh, we have told you that we are planning to be on the 345 to 365 KBD. 
Uh, we are projecting to be on the high side of, uh, that range. 
Regarding margin for projecting for, eh, 2021, we are projecting to finish the year between the both business, Cartagena and Barranca, 
eh, on the upper side of the one digit. So flow to the tens, uh, dollar per barrel for 2021. 
Regarding, eh, 2022, I will say that we see margins, eh, coming up. 
Although I have to mention the, uh, during the first, eh, half of the year, we do have planned maintenance activities, eh, at both refineries. At 
Barranca and Cartagena. 
And mainly on the first half of the year. 
Eh, so but in overall, in overall, we see, uh, margins, eh, eh… You know, there will be some ups and downs, 
because that depends on what type of, uh, maintenance activities we do every month. 
But in overall, we see margins for 2022 on the, I will say on the low side of the two digits for the refining business. 
And I thi- uh, I think that, uh, I would like to mention that, 
eh, 2021 and ' 
22, 2022, are very heavy on turnaround activities for maintenance activities at both refineries. Because, eh, most of the activities were planned for 2022. 
But because of COVID-19 
and pandemic, eh, we need to move, eh, some of those maintenance of 2020… From 2020 to 2021, and 2022. 
I hope, Matthew, I was, uh, clear and I was able to answer your, your questions. Thank you. 
Our next question comes from Mistene Falanga from Bradesco. 
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Uh, thank you for taking my questions. 
Uh, m- my first one is, uh, regarding Brazil. Uh, when do you expect, uh, the drilling of, of the first well there? And sort of where, what are the next key milestones? 
Uh, my second question is regarding to Unconventional, 
uh, do you feel that after we get the licenses for, for Calle and Platero, 
uh, that, that, you know, for, for other f- future potential areas, uh, these licenses could, could, could come up quicker? A- 
And then if I just may, sorry. Eh, uh, a followup on the previous question. 
Uh, d- do you still see risks of, uh, of public order in the Canyo Leman pipeline, uh, this quarter, 
uh, that, that, that could, uh, again affect refineries? Or, or, or things are calmer there? Thank you. 
Misente, good morning. And thanks for the question. With regards to Brazil, what, uh, we are, um, doing right now. 
Uh, in terms of exploration, 
uh, we are in the planning phase, uh, to drill, uh, our second well in the Saturno 
block. Which, um, um, basically is what we call the Yapitos prospect. 
And we expect to drill this well, em, late in 2022 or early 2023. 
Uh, and, and this will depend very much in, in our conversations with our planners in that case, uh, Shell and, and Chevron. 
Um, also in terms of, uh, development. Uh, just to recognize that, that Gato Do Mato is going well. And that we 
have, uh, several, uh, milestones to complete in the, in the next, uh, few months. 
The first one is the award of the FPSO, uh, the Floating Production Storage and Offloading facility. 
Uh, initiate fabrication of the FPSO. Uh, also award the sub-sea, uh, facilities contract. 
And, uh, depending, eh, in the advance in the progress of those activities, we are shooting for, uh, an early 
start at the end of 2025, early 2026. 
That's the program. If we see opportunities to drill additional wells, that will be depending very much in decisions taken with our partners. 
So that's times where we are in Brazil, um, 
Misente. Uh, inaudible, with regards to inaudible the, the, em, Unconventional. 
So we are in the process, eh, as, as we mentioned that in our report, uh, in the process of, uh, obtaining the licenses for Calle and Platero. 
We, we already de- delivered the, the environmental assessment study for Calle. 
And we are, uh, trying to do so, uh, uh, for Plato- for Platero. 
So, 
eh, in, in terms of, uh, with inaudible, we will, um, increase the, the potential of, uh, getting licenses from the area. 
I will be very conservative. I, I think our focus should be in the two areas where we have, uh, eh, at this moment the inaudible. 
Once that we are successful in, in, in, in getting the licenses inaudible well at, at, us doing, uh, uh, the execution of well, doing 
the drilling of the well. Then we can foresee there are opportunities in inaudible. inaudible 
point I'd just, um, like to add. And, and before you come back to Canyon Leman, and the third question is, 
eh, what inaudible, eh, with regards to the, uh, Unconventional pilots in Colombia, is that this is not about doing it quickly. It's about doing it well. 
And in that sense, and you, you saw some of the, uh, the timelines that we produce in the report, eh, we see ourselves, uh, drilling the wells in 2023. 
But we're working to see if we can actually accelerate that drilling. And inaudible bring that forward into 2022. 
But bear in mind that after we have all the results and the data, 
there's an independent commission that will look at the results of the pilot and determine if the pilots were successful or not. 
In terms of they're achieving the objective that were set up with the regulations in the pilot. 
So we'll make to see what that, what that means. Having said that, 
eh, obviously we've, we've worked on identifying additional areas with potential. 
And, uh, thinking about how can we take this next, uh, level in terms of becoming part of the, uh, the operation that we're doing. 
You know, we now have a lot of expertise from the Korean, we inaudible. So that's being, 
eh, both being brought home, 
in terms of, uh, planning and ensuring that we can understand how to move 
to the next phase. Which, eh, uh, if I understand correctly, is sort of the, uh, the question. 
And, uh, and then in terms of, uh, Canyo 
Leman. Yeah, well, in terms of Canyo Leman, we, we need to recognize that we have the pressure of social unrest, 
eh, and guerrilla activity in both the Catatumbo and the Aralca regions. 
So, so there the risk is that, that we have the, the contingency means to manage, uh, the production impact. 
If the Canyo Leman, uh, pipeline, 
uh, is, uh, affected by, by this social unrest, then we have the contingent route of the inaudible pipeline. 
If this is working at, as… Been working due in the third quarter where we have 11 inaudible. 10 
inaudible major impact in terms of, uh, um, uh, the loads for the, the refineries. Particularly in Barrancabermeja. 
Thank you. Our next question from from Frank Meganne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Okay. 
Thank you very much. Um, just, you know, maybe stepping back to, uh, a little bigger picture in terms of how you're seeing the CapEx potential in upstream. 
Um, after the last four or five years, which, <laugh>, um, you went from, you know, 
having a lot of, you know, opportunities and, and being very aggressive to, you know, pulling back 
as, as… You know, right, rightfully so, 
to, um, restore the balance sheet and, and, and not, you know, overly get over-aggressive in terms of spending, given the less clear environment as, especially of course of the last 18, 24 months. 
I'm just thinking ha- you know, wondering now how you're, how you're thinking about upstream. 
Um, you've got, I would assume, a lot of kind of, uh, low hanging fruit that you could potentially exploit. You could, uh, you know, 
I would think you could, um, increase CapEx quite a bit, and, and profitably so if, if you wanted to. But I'm just wondering how, how big that portfolio is potentially 
inaudible one. And secondly, um, are you, are you tempted to get more aggressive over the next couple of years given the very favorable environment in, in I think fairly short payback period that you have for a lot of those investments? 
Thanks, Frank. And, um, 
great question. And, uh, and I think, um, 
I'll provide you some, um, some views. And then Heimich, and inaudible, and Roberto as well. And, and I think I can sorta basically inaudible the views. 
But, uh, the way I, um, I would put it. And I, 
I like your, 
uh, eh, your intro to the question in terms of, uh, us being, eh, explicitly very careful with the management of the balance sheet and the opportunities. be careful with the management of the balance sheets and the opportunities. 
And if you look at, um, how we've, uh, ramped up CapEx over the last few years 
from basically, uh, 2.2 billion in 2017 to 2.9 billion in ' 18, to three and a half in 2019, 
we'll be in that range this year. And, uh, 
I was, um, answering a question earlier saying that we see ourselves in the $4 billion to $5 
billion range, uh, organic excluding ISA. 
And historically, 80% to 85% of the CapEx has gone to the upstream. 
So we're not going to abandon that. So, uh, there will be, uh, additional focus in terms of exploration. 
And this goes from, uh, 
uh, looking at seismic that we already have and doing the, uh, reinterpretation of that seismic with new technology and new capabilities. 
So that's point number one. 
And I think the, uh, the news that we gave the markets earlier in the week 
with, uh, the media, JW, the well, which is the discovery of a inaudible show that, 
um, sort of adjusting our view on exploration is paying off. 
And I think that's very important. 
Uh, this year we'll end up with some 400 wells, 
uh, in our, in our portfolio that we've drilled, development wells. We should probably see an increase in that. And that's the way you're going to think about it. 
If you look at geographically, 
uh, we have, um, very good activity in the Permia 
and it's paying off. It's, it's not only providing, uh, molecules or barrels, but it's also producing good EBITDA. 
You know, and we'll be able to top that, uh, when we close the year 
and the likes. Uh, so a lot of focus in Colombia, but we do have, uh, focus in both the Permian… And Alberta was just referring to Gato Domato in Brazil 
that will require some additional CapEx. 
But clearly, focus in Colombia were, uh, EOR techniques. Increasing recovery factors are fundamental. 
We have to deal with a 15 to 17 decline, natural decline per year in our main fields. 
Uh, good news. I think inaudible are healthy. 
We, we've done a lot of work over the last, uh, four or five years in terms of deficiencies in terms of becoming, 
uh, much better in terms of producing margin, you know, at the upstream level. So I think that's, that's paying off. 
Having said that, and we, we had a, a, I think a good discussion earlier on about 
sector inflation and some of the things that we're doing. But again, things like zero based budgeting 
and something called performance plus, which is an internal program to look at more efficiencies, I think can provide a lot of, 
um, support in terms of, uh, how we see ourselves going, going forward. 
And we have, uh, identified lot of opportunities. 
Uh, we have something called the taxonomy, so we know which each and every opportunity that we have in pipeline ranks up, uh… But, and I'll stop here, 
we don't want to get crazy, you know, in terms of spending money just for the sake of spending money. 
We wanna stay very focused and disciplined in terms of how do we inaudible, uh, the CapEx in the operations. 
inaudible, if you wanna add something else inaudible, jump in. Than- thank 
you, Felipe. 
So, so Frank, uh, good to hear you. 
I'll give you some color. And, and, and initially I'm gonna, 
I'm gonna give you some broad, uh, group numbers that, that provide context for the, for the conversation, and then some directional numbers associated to the plan which we're working on. 
I think, I think the biggest headline is that as we, as we look to refresh the plan ' 23, ' 24 in the context of a higher price environment, 
and in the context of course, of the, of the production lag that we've seen this year, 
clearly our, our strategic intent is to increase production, right? 
So direction. What we wanna do with the upstream is to increase production. 
And, and the good news is that the, the result of the portfolio analysis that we've been having over the, over, over the last few months 
is one that indicates a stronger portfolio 
with more prospects, with more possibilities, and therefore, with more, with more value, 
right? To, to give you an idea, you know, this year's plan compared to, to last year's plan, uh, speaks about, 
um, maturing around 1.5 billion, uh, barrels of resources of three P resources, right? 
That's the extent of the total portfolio. 
Last, when we were looking at this number 18 months ago, it was more in the 1.1 kind of range. So we've actually seen a bigger portfolio to, to work with. 
The second thing that we're seeing is that in the context of the full agenda of a performance plus and efficiencies and becoming more competitive and the like, 
we're also seeing improved ratings, and therefore a more value associated to the portfolio. 
So directionally, a portfolio that maybe a couple of years ago was worth, and I'm talking about the growth component of the portfolio, around $6 billion in, in, in NPV. 
It's now around $9 billion in NPV. 
So where I'm trying to go here is, is, is that there's, there's value to be had. And we, and we wanna change that value. 
Obviously in a disciplined way, like, like Felipe had mentioned in a structured way, but, but, but there's, there's, there's value to be created. 
When you look at the ramp up of activity, the ramp up of activity, uh, that we expect to have inaudible, it's, it's, it's significant. 
We're talking about, you know, directionally around 540 wells of development wells next year, around 600 workover, 
uh, uh, workovers, around anywhere between 25 and 30 exploration wells. And, and going back into sizing 
so this is, this is… You know, the opportunities are there and they're sufficiently mature. 
Let me give you a statistic here. Uh, all these numbers that I'm quoting, about 67% of the activity set, 
it's already in its, in its, uh, third or fourth stage of maturing. 
So there, there are things that are reasonably good to go, and it gives us confidence that we're gonna be able to, to execute them this, uh, next year. 
So kind of, that's where we're going. When you look at that number that Felipe had mentioned of between $4 billion and $5 billion of organic, of organic CapEx… Uh, 
I would say that, that, that, uh, the upstream, uh, as usual will represent a, a, a big, a big chunk of that. 
Uh, when we look at the three years, I would expect upstream to be, to be capturing 
probably anywhere between $10 billion and $12 billion of CapEx. 
Upstream alone. That's, that's where directionally we're heading. 
Obviously, this is all subject to some fine tuning. And we're gonna have a more detailed conversation in February, but that's, that's where our head is right now. Frank, and, uh, I, 
I will just add that, um, when, when you look at our portfolio, uh, and years back, our focus was, uh, 
the main and mature fields, uh, heavy oil fields. 
So now in, in our plant now, 
you'll see new areas emerging. For example, in terms of exploration, you'll see activity, uh, associated with the, the Caribbean offshore 
and also, um, a lot of focus in terms of, uh, the, the inaudible foothills, where 
we have, uh, the expectation of finding both, uh, light oil and gas. 
So, um, so you'll see that diversification… When you look at other projects 
that are gonna be emerged, you'll see inaudible close to inaudible, which 
will be another focus in our portfolio. 
So, so, uh, more diversification, I would say. Thanks, Alberto. Thanks, inaudible. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Audi from Santander. 
Thank you. Hello Felipe, inaudible. Hope you're well. Um, 
I wanted to get your views on a couple of points. 
Um, first, uh, capital allocation, and then on the return on capital employed. 
In terms of capital allocation, um, you've already touched on CapEx. Um, 
I was wondering if you could also touch on deleveraging and, 
uh, and dividend payments, 
um, how you prioritize those, given the very strong results in cash flow generation that you're having. 
And, um, also touch on 
the potential need for an equity offering. Um, and whether that equity offering, if needed, would be more to, um, supply ISA with capital to pursue, uh, inorganic growth, or is it, would it be more driven to just, um, strengthen the overall inaudible patrol financial position? 
And then in terms of, um, return on capital employed, which is an area where you've… The company always stood out relative to your peers, 
um, with the addition of ISA that has great margins and, and great return and capital employed, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you see… Uh, well, let's see… 
Maybe X ISA is going into, uh, 2022, please. Thank you. 
Thank you, Christian. Uh, hope you're doing well. 
So, um, so, so, let's talk about capital location and inaudible. I, I, I'd first start with kinda, what is our, what is our view of the, of the world going forward in terms of price environment? 
Because it actually, it actually does set the stage a lot around how to think about, 
uh, uh, some of the questions you're making, you know, a capital allocation, deleveraging, dividends and the 
like. And, and, and one of the things that, that, that we've seen is that, um, uh, fundamentals do support a, a, a, a, a more optimistic view 
around, around prices going forward. 
You might recall that in the plan, 
the plan that we're actually executing right now, our, our price assumption for this year was, was around $45 per barrel. 
Next year, we were looking at $50 per barrel, 
and that's something that we have been reflecting on, and that we are gonna update in our plans going forward. 
So the outlook in which we are planning ahead is one where, where, where next year is at $63 per barrel, 
and ' 23 and ' 24 at, are at 60. 
These, these, this price that, uh, uh, uh, is still, is still conservative. It's still conservative. Uh, when you look at, at the current, you know, uh, uh, headline price, uh… 
But we believe that it kind of position us as well in a place where, where we can retain our capital discipline, capital and cost discipline, 
whilst at the same time, making sure that we don't leave opportunities, uh, on the table. 
Uh, the broader conversation around long term price, uh, uh, uh, in, in this business, 
we, we still remain conservative. We believe that that our, all our projects need to fly at $50 per barrel. 
And that's that in a, in a, in a view that when you look at the, the majority of our projects and the time to market inaudible these projects, you're looking at the long term. 
So that's how we're saying about this, right? 
So with that in mind, what, what are we looking at? What we're looking at, uh, firstly, in, in terms of your question about, of 
our own leverage and that, that 2.5 times, uh, gross step to inaudible that we have been operating is one that seems reasonable, right? 
It seems reasonable, and it continues to be reasonable when you look ahead. 
What is the balance that we wanna have? The balance that we wanna have is one where we have a bit of space there to, uh, encourage them, whether it's for inorganic opportunities that might arise, 
uh, and also to capture or to reflect in our consolidated balance sheet, the, the leverage that ISA, eh, might have. Given that their ceiling is 4.5 times gross debt to EBITDA. 
Why is that important? Uh, uh, leverage is an engine of growth for ISA. 
ISA has a pipeline of opportunities going forward that is very attractive. 
The more we look at it, the more excited we are, uh, and, and we definitely don't want capital to be a constraint for ISA's growth, 
right? So, so we are comfortable with that range that inaudible operating in. 
It's 3.5 to 4.5 times, and we wouldn't have any problem with ISA going to the very top end of that range. 
Uh, so with that, uh, our range of 2.5 kind of makes sense. That's ho- that's how we're looking at this. 
Now on leverage, we're not gonna stay, uh, uh, put. 
We just had this liability management transaction, we put two billion, uh, of our… inaudible of the near term. 
It was an expiry that we weren't gonna have in 2023. 
Now we kick that off into the future, and we intend to do that, uh, more. 
We believe that the, the fundamentals of the capital markets right now and the results that inaudible are delivering allows to pursue more transactions like that into the future. So directly, that's how we're thinking about that. 
With regards to dividend payments, 
you know our policy. Our policy remains unchanged, 40% to 60% of, of net income. And in good years, 
you should expect, and we all should expect to be on the very high end of that range. 
That's how we're thinking ahead. And that's how we're planning our, our, our cash on our, on our, on our, on our CapEx, uh, accordingly. 
Equity offering, where does the equity offering fit in into all of this? 
It's about optionality. 
It's about optionality, Christian. 
Uh, the idea here is that, uh, 
whilst our, our spending is robust and we're comfortable with, with, with leverage and we're comfortable with just, with our ability to fund this CapEx for growth, which is our main impact… 
We wanna continue growing the company. 
Uh, we believe that the equity offering offers the optionality to support whether it's a, an increase, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, necessity of, of, of CapEx, you know, that's, that's competitive, uh, whether it's organic or inorganic, or simply to strengthen the balance sheet. 
Directionally right now, it would be about strengthening the balance sheet. 
It would be about reducing the depth that we have to, to get into a more comfortable level. 
Finally, with regards to your question around inaudible, uh, you might have seen that we posted a, a pretty solid inaudible, 10.8%, which is great, 
you know, uh, going back to double digits. 
Uh, it's, it's a number that puts us in, in with very little company in our sector. Very, very few companies are up there with us. 
And, and, and we're happy about that. 
When you include ISA in the equation, ISA is inaudible. With ISA, we're actually… 
Uh, I- ISA will probably add… Once you normalize temporary effects and, and the like, because obviously it's a consolidation 
that you're seeing right now only reflects one month. 
But once you normalize for, if you will, business as usual with ISA, 
ISA is gonna add probably, uh, you know, four or five, uh, uh, uh, uh, points into that. So I, 
I would believe that hopefully by year end, we're gonna be, uh, above 12% in terms of inaudible and we can sustain that into the future. 
Obviously, depending on price, 
but, but that's, that's what we believe in right now. Thanks, Christian. Thank you. 
We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bayon for final remarks. 
Thank you so much. And, um, very, very quickly. I'd just like to thank everyone for being here today at the conference call. 
And, uh, thanks again for following Ecopetrol, for the interest that you've put into, uh, our activities and how we continue to make progress. 
Very good results for the quarter. Uh, very good results, not only in terms of numbers, but in terms of how strategically we continue to advance. 
It's great to have now, uh, one month of inaudible results into our consolidated results. Uh, very, very pleased with the acquisition. It's going very well. 
We continue to make progress in our TESG agenda. 
And, uh, hopefully we'll be able to, 
um, uh, sit again with you guys virtually, uh, for, uh, year end, uh, results and conversations around our plans going forward. 
So, uh, hope that everybody stays safe. Please take care. And th- thanks again for being with us today at this, uh, conference call. Bye-bye. foreign language. 
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
