Good day and welcome to today's third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. 
There will be presentation followed by question and answer session at which time if you wish to ask a question, you will need to press star and one on your telephone keypad. 
I also must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, and I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Arman Arutyunian. Thank you. Please go ahead sir. 
Thank you. Uh, hello everyone and welcome to HeadHunter Group third quarter 2021 earnings call. 
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mikhail Zhukov our Chief Executive Officer, 
Dmitry Sergienkov our Deputy Chief Executive Officer, and Grigorii Moiseev our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin, we would like you to remind that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. 
Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by such statements, 
and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. 
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. 
For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section in our most recent Annual Report 
on Form 20-F filed with the SEC. 
During this call, we will, we'll be referring to some non- IFRS financial measures. 
Uh, these non- IFRS financial measures are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
A reconciliation of the non- IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures is provided in the earnings release we issued today and the slide presentation, 
each of which is available on our website at investor.hh.ru. 
Now, I'd like to call, uh, to turn the call over to Mikhail. 
Thank you, Arman, Uh, good afternoon, everyone, uh. Thanks for joining us today. This was an exceptionally solid quarter for our product and business development. Uh, 
Dmitry and Grigorii will walk the, this through in detail later on, 
but we have yet again managed to double our revenue base compared to 2020 and hit all major business KPIs. 
As our user base strikes new historical records, 
it's essential to stay laser-focused on product innovation and adaptation of our platform to distant customer segments. 
One of our key product priorities continues to be seamless and enjoyable experience for non-recruitment professionals from SMAs. 
This customer category has been the key driver of our business growth 
and foreign candidate migration to mobile devices. We are now observing similar trends in that area. 
That is why we decided to come up with fully reworked employer mobile application built on predictive interfaces. 
It's still early to draw any strong conclusions, 
but at the moment, we see that the key conversions to use a target actions in the new app have improved by 10% to 20%, 
thereby delivering high recruitment efficiency and business results for our clients. 
On the job seeker sites, we launched wide experiments with employer review functionality, integrated with our strategic partner Dreamjob, 
and that showed very encouraging engagement from both candidates and employers. 
Even though it's in experimental phase, yet, uh, circa 15% of our vacancies already have cooperator use, 
and we plan to scale the functionality across, uh, the entire customer base in the next few quarters. 
On the investment side, we have finally made reviews YouDo, and 
now we're institutionally ready to move along our joint strategy in a self-employed market 
where we continue to see major growth opportunities for us. 
Now I'll turn it to Dima to walk you through the key highlights of the third quarter. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mikhail. Uh, good afternoon. Uh, thank you for joining us on this call. 
Uh, this quarter, our revenue was 4.7 billion RUB 
and we managed to sustain, as Mikhail said, a triple-digit revenue growth despite a much higher comparison base than in, in second quarter. 
Uh, market conditions remained very strong. 
We have, uh, significantly expand our business across the key strategic areas, including acquisition of small and medium businesses and monetization of key accounts. 
Uh, despite a significant increase in marketing spend, our other cost items are significantly behind the top-line expansion, leading to elevated profitability. 
In Q3 our adjusted EBITDA margin came at, uh, 60.4%. 
This year, we follow conservative capex policy, resulting in strong cash generation for shareholders. Our capex in Q3 as a percentage of revenue came in just circa 
1%. Uh, in terms of performance by operating segmentsâ€¦ 
In Small and Medium Accounts, revenue increased by 106% year-on-year, driven by both increase in number of paying customers and ARPC growth. 
Acquisition of new clients explained circa 56 percentage points of revenue growth in small and medium segment. 
Our total customer base reached 450,000 clients, and this quarter already exceeding full-year 2020. 
In Key Accounts segment, uh, average consumption growth and monetization initiatives were the key drivers to our strong performance. 
Notably, average check in this segment increased by 71% year-on-year, and 
that is largely explained by new monetization model for subscriptions gaining pace across the customer base. 
Geographically, revenue from Moscow and St. Petersburg increased by 98% year-on-year, while revenue from other regions of Russia went up by 110%, which is totally in line with our expansion strategy in, uh, Russian regions. 
Uh, product dynamics this quarter is somewhat similar to what we've seen in second quarter. Uh, job postings remained the fastest growing area on the back of increased consumption in Small and Medium and Key Accounts. 
In this, uh, competitive environment clients utilized advertising tools more intensively, leading to ever-growing consumption per client. 
As a result, the total number of vacancies on the platform reached historical record to 1. 1 million, of which over 1 million are paid vacancies. A 
CV Database Access and Bundled Subscription demonstrated 94% and 89% growth year-on-year, respectively, 
as you can see the growth in subscriptions is, uh, kinda converging with leasing products thanks to monetization enhancements of the former. 
Apart from our core products, we are very satisfied with the solid dynamics of our value-added services 
including recruitment automation, branding products, our performance-based solutions, ClickMe and Virtual Recruiter. 
Skillaz demonstrated yet another strong quarter of customer base 
expansion with revenue came close to 300 RUB, uh, inaudible million RUB, representing, uh, uh, 200% growth year-on-year 
and reaching EBITDA break-even level first time in company history. 
Um, this group of value-added services generated over 0.5 billion revenues in Q3, yielding growth of 136%. 
Th- this just underscores market openness for innovative HR tech solutions in today's, uh, challenging environment. 
Now turning to our full-year 2021 outlook. 
Uh, this year, as you understand, is particularly difficult to make, uh, precise projections. Uh, from the one hand, our business performance exceptionally strong and market backdrop is bit robust; 
but on the other hand, the pandemic stat in Russia is far from being stable yet. 
Uh, taking those factors into consideration we've decided to upgrade our full-year 2021 outlook to 
81, 84% revenue growth range, indicated over, uh, 15 billion revenues, uh, for HeadHunter Group inaudible. 
Now here's Grigorii to talk about our profitability and cash flow metrics. 
Yeah, thanks Dima and, um, good afternoon everyone. 
Let me give you some detail first on our expenses and margins. Uh, as Dima said, in the third quarter of 2021, 
the adjusted EBITDA margin exceeded the milestone of 60%. 
Consolidation of Zarplata and Skillaz diluted margin by circa four percentage points, 
so, therefore, our organic segments' margin was even higher in the ballpark of 64%, 
which is a significant improvement, uh, compared to 56.6% in the same segments in the third quarter of 2020, 
which was explained mostly by the increase in our revenue. 
At the same time, uh, with autumn being, uh, the busiest season in work routine, 
uh, the third quarter is usually the highest quarter of any year in terms of revenue, 
and, uh, consequently, uh, has the lowest expenses as percentage of revenue and the highest margin. 
Therefore, margin in Q3 is somewhat elevated and we expect it to trend down in Q4. 
Historically, over the last two years, margin in the fourth quarter was four to 10 percentage points lower compared to the third quarter. 
Our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were circa 2 billion RUB in the third quarter of 2021, 
which was the increase of 69.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
Adjusted for equity-settled awards, SPO and M&A-related costs, operating expenses were around 1.9 billion, 
which was an 85% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. 
And let me briefly discuss the, uh, growth drivers in the key expen- expense markets. 
First of all, personnel expenses adjusted for equity-settled awards and SPO-related costs increased by 61% year-on-year. 
About one-third of this growth is explained by consolidations of Zarplata and Skillaz. 
The other factors were the increase in our headcount by circa 15% or 126 people over the last 12 months 
and increase in our sales team bonuses on the back of exceeding revenue targets and wages inflation. 
As a percentage of revenue, personnel expenses excluding equity-settled awards and SPO-related costs have 
decreased to 19.3% in the Q3 of 2021 
from 24.3% in the third quarter of 2020, 
improving margin by, uh, five percentage points. 
We think that in, uh, in the fourth quarter, 
we will sustain this operating leverage and personnel expenses will be the key contributor to our margin expansion in the full-year 2021. 
Speaking of personnel expenses, 
our equity-settled awards increased to 136 million RUB in the third quarter of 2021 
compared to 56 million for the third quarter last year 
or by circa 80 million. 
This was mostly due to a new 2021 RSU plan 
we established in July, under which we granted approximately 250,000 units, 
or circa 8%, of the total program capacity 
to absentâ€¦ uh, to approximately 100 of our employees. 
Moving on to marketing expenses. They increased significantly by 140% year-on-year outpacing revenue growth. 
The increase in marketing was mostly due to our decision to increase spending on both performance and brand awareness marketing in 2021 
on the back of the increase-â€¦ where in this markets in, in 2021 on the back of increase demand for candidates. 
In addition, approximately one third of this growth was due to surplus consolidation. 
As a percentage of revenue, marketing increased to 12% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 10% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Going forward, for the full year 2021, 
we think that the operating leverage potential in this bracket will be offset by our decision to increase spending. 
On the general and administrative expenses adjusted for SPO and MNA-related costs, increased by 90% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
The key drivers of this growth were the additional inaudible which contributed almost half of the growth in the bracket, 
as well as an increase in subcontractor costs in our Russia segment due to the increase in revenue from other related services, and the increasing professional services. 
As a percentage of revenue, other general and administrative expenses adjusted for SPO and MNA-related costs, they're 8.4% relatively flat compared to 9% in the third quarter of 2020. 
In the full year 2021 results, we expect this expense bracket to remain relatively flat as percentage of revenue compared to last year. 
Now moving on to other key indicators, our capex in the third quarter of 2021 has decreased to 49 million compared to 70 million in the third quarter last year 
as we completed our most costly renovation project last year. 
On the back of increasing revenue, as inaudible said, capex decreased to circa 1% of revenue in the third quarter 
this year compared to around 3% in the third quarter of 2020. 
The net worth in capital at the end of Q3 was -5.1 billion rubles, compared to -3.8 billion, as of the end of 2020, 
and the change was primarily due to customer advances we received. 
Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2021 was 548 million compared to 264 million in the third quarter of 2020. 
The increase was driven by the increase in revenues and consecutive increase in the taxable profit. 
The effective tax rate in the Q3 was 23.7% compared to the 31.1 in the 3rd quarter last year. 
This decrease was mainly attributed to a non deductible SPO-related expense last year not occurring in this 3rd quarter. 
Now turn into cash generation methods in the 3rd quarter of 2021. 
We generated significant 2.5 billion rubles from appraisal activities compared to 902 million in the 3rd quarter last year, 
primarily driven by the increase in sales. 
We generated 16 million rubles 
from investment activities compared to 50 million used in the third quarter last year mainly on the back of the increase in interest income on cash deposits. 
In financing activities, we used 2.4 billion rubles in the third quarter 2021 most efficient way and earlier announced dividends for the year 2020 
compared to 2.1 billion we used on third quarter last year, which was also mostly attributable to a dividend payout. 
Our net debt decreased from 5 billion as of the 2020 year round 
to 2.3 billion as of the end of Q3 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash. 
On the back of this increase in the debt and the increase in adjustment to be done, 
our leverage is now 0.3 times adjusted EBIT compared to 1.2 times adjusted EBIT as of 
the 
2020 year end. Finally starting from October 2021, we are making inaudible repurchases of our EDRs through our broker in a forum on a Domino's 
buyback program. 
The program stipulates that during nine months until June 2022, our broker should purchase EDRs for approximately $27 million 
in more or less equal daily installments. 
Accordingly as of November 8 2021, the most recent date of the brokers report obtainable when we prepared this release, 
we have repurchased 20, sorry, 52,000 EDRs for circa $3 million. 
This concludes our presentation of the results of the third quarter of 2021 and we are now opening the floor to your questions. Thank you. 
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And as a reminder, for those who want to ask a question, 
just press star and one on your telephone keypad and wait for your name to be announced. 
Once again, star and one if you wish to ask a question. <silence> 
Thank you. We have questions that came through. 
The first question comes from the line of inaudible from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open, please go ahead. 
Yes thank you very much for the call, couple of questions. 
So firstly, how do you directionally think over 2022 budgeting? Obviously, I know it's probably too early, but what are the key moving factors to keep in mind over the growth and margins for the next year? 
Obviously, the base is quite high. But, uh, what are the key drivers that will be having a lasting effects in the medium term 
and maybe, how would you split them, uh, for the next year between volumes and pricing? 
And my second question would be with regards to the mobile product for employers that can you elaborate what are the user cases there? 
How popular is that? How differentiated is that versus the competition? 
And maybe broadly, uh, your other product initiatives that are in the pipeline? Thank you. 
Sorry inaudible go ahead. Yeah, sure, I can quickly answer the first part of the first question on the, on the budgeting 
and ho- how we think about next year. 
Obviously, you, you are not going to be unduly surprised that in this point of time, it's quite hard to give a precise or official guidance for next year. 
And there are definitely certain moving parts, 
mostly with regard to the kind of customer base growth next year will be that will be 
a function of overall mockery level market situation development. Uh, 
I think we're having pretty, at this point of time if you look into the 2022, we have our 
quite optimistic view on health, we're going to mix between monetization and then the customer base expansion. 
On monetization, it's, it's more kind of visible already and predictable 
because there are certain initiatives that already kind of kicked in this year and we can, more or less precisely calculate the impact for next year. 
Obviously, one of the major initiatives would be the kind of the continuous, uh, rollout our, uh, new subscription model. 
As we said, this year, this product has been performing 
exceptionally well. And uh, actually above our original expectation, the guidance we gave, 
uh, and I think next, next year therefore, we also kind of upgrading our expectations, we believe that this one single kind of monetization is 
that could define after 7% of revenue growth next year. 
And on, on top of that, you have the other pricing initiatives, we're going to inflate prices starting from January, not April 
like this year. So we'll be some timing difference effect as well. 
And so the price increase, we expect at least 10% growth and subscriptions in bigger 
packages of job postings we expect, the sort of 20% growth plus. 
And of course all these, these components will go on top of those, uh, I already mentioned in the subscription model. 
And we actually made good progress upgrading our back end infrastructure, uh, and business logic for monetization this year. 
And next year, we're going to be going more in depth on the differentiation by professions, roles, regions, 
that should also give us the incremental inaudible growth and also may actually help us to going to differentiate between small medium businesses and key accounts. 
So on monetization, is it looks very robust next year. 
On a customer base. I think it's again, it's a bit probably premature to guide. 
At the moment it looks quite strong but again, these situations evolve quite quickly so it will be hard. 
And I will defer to command on expenses to inaudible. 
Yeah, uh, from me, we are kind of in the middle of the budget session right now 
and as we, as we discuss, 
we definitely see, uh, 
uh, several areas for growth. 
Uh, 
uh, you know, the numerous, sensitive sensible initiatives for the 2022. 
And, um, certainly it doesn't make sense from our point of view to kind of just cut them off just for the sake of the for its own for stability. 
Therefore, as inaudible said, were not prepared to give any guidance at this point on, 
uh, on 2022 actually in both confirmed new growth and margins. Uh, what 
I can say is that the budget will definitely contain, uh, certain investment components in terms 
of, uh, in terms of the expenses. 
I think, mmh, 
I think also important to kind of understand again, that the 2021 was the year of very steep revenue growth. 
And sometimes in some areas we struggled for resources. So, probably, uh, kind of, 
uh, not the best reference points as well, uh, for the future planning. 
Um, yep, so I guess that's, that's the, the comment I can give you on the, on the margin front. Thank you inaudible. 
I think we can move on to the, the second question from inaudible on our, on our new mobile product. Um, 
I could say that we historically were a little bit dismissive on kind of mobile platform for employers because we saw very limited use cases. 
And most of our, 
most of our clients extra prefer to use either mobile, 
uh, mobile interface wire or actually just wired mobile devices, but not in, in any app functionality 
or they just continue use desktop. 
So historically, we didn't invest much in that area 
andâ€¦ If uh we do not invest so much in that area and uh last few years, especially during COVID, that that uh situation has significant change in our view. 
We- we saw some pick up in- in demand, in usage, and uh predominantly from overseas small and medium businesses from non uh recruitment professionals. 
And this is how actually we- we designed it, this new app so that that's clearly designed for a very uh easy and simplified uh 
workflow with the kind of call to action approach when we order predictive actions when you don't need to fill out the details and the machine using some 
machine learning instruments and back-end are trying to kind of predict these answers. And then they're going to minimize the questions we ask. 
So that that- that's clear target that- that they uh estimate usage. 
Uh with the same time we- we try to kind of uh factor in the, incorporate the functionality that- that is usually very popular among the key accounts, as well. 
Like, for example, working with uh 
with archive and the integrations with their e-tiers and uh, for example, communication platforms that we introduced in our job-seeker uh platform earlier this year, 
we actually uh did the same for our employer 
app uh it's because it's becoming kind of core from the functionality. 
And, also, our belief that our new app, especially on Android platform, going to be much more stable 
and uh the kind of old metrics that we collected over the last uh one and half months since the launch of the Android 
platform shows us that uh, that's actually the case. 
And we look at theâ€¦ Again it's- it's- it's early to draw some small conclusions yet, I don't, there's a lot of product works required for this new app, 
uh, but uh we already see uh up to 20 percent improvement in- in conversions, especially in registration, in uh purchases et cetera. 
And for small and medium business support, we believe that that should be quite helpful for- for all key k- key metrics and efficiency level of the platform will grow for the- for this category. Okay, thank you very much. Thanks, Paul. 
Thank you. And the next question comes from uh Ivan Kim from Xtellus Capital, your line is now open, please go ahead. 
Hi, yes, good afternoon. Uh, yes, I have two questions from my side please. Firstly, um, on the fourth quarter 
um, we didn't see um any impact on job postings on your platform in November 
uh but if you can uh just comment um on what sort of impact lockdown uh had or has um on your members so far. 
Uh secondly, um 
we um ask Skillus, um what sort of growth outlook are you foresee for 22 for Skillus in particular, um ballpark very wide ranges or directionally 
uh would be uh great, and related question to that is whether you consider uh further expansion to adjacencies 
because as Skillus' um experience shows, you um increase your targeted inaudible massively with one small acquisition 
so just wondering, there was your good deal, obviously, but um if you think um about uh expansion there more aggressively in 22 in adjacencies. Thank you very much. 
Uh thanks inaudible, um I'll handle these questions. Um the first uh on the November lockdown 
um no of course we saw a deceleration in uh, in billing and with billings and bookings, so that week of uh non-working days, 
luckily was just uh just a week, for the majority of regions. 
Of course in certain- certain regions uh extended the term 
so we saw certain under performance in uh in the shorter term products, especially short subscriptions, more packages of job postings 
soâ€¦ Telegraph day, on- in rough- rough terms 
uh we lost that week circa 25 percent uh percentage points of growth compared to the previous, the week before the lockdown. 
Uh that is clearly uh a better picture that we observed uh last year when we're in a constant 
non-working mode, right? In June and in- in May. 
And that- that just shows that the business has been uh adapted to a large extent. It's been operating in this environment for 
more than a year already. And um especially in key accounts, we saw very little uh 
disruption, uh and weâ€¦ Most of our uh clients and our big enterprises just continued uh operations as normal. 
But, of course, in uh, in small medium businesses, there was enough impact um but it was n- n- not as severe as- as we saw it in- in previous lockdowns. 
Um that's 
on the- on the uh lockdown, uh I think on the fourth quarter 
otherwise, it's- yeah this is so far, quarter to date performance is quite- quite encouraging. 
Uh, but no one knows actually what to expect in the next uh one month and half right? So the- the risk of uh- uh restrictive measures uh is quite high 
and uh it's not binary. It's not that it's uh either there are or not. It's- 
It's certain regions, they're talking some local decisions, so that should have im- impact on certain regions. As such it's h- it's quite hard to predict exact uh impact in first quarter. 
On the Skillus uh the fourth quarter traditionally is the strongest quarter. 
Uh you- you expect that this uh rush counters the design uh, they tend to be kind of signed uh that they kind of last- last minute 
uh when the- the budgets allocated to the department kind of go off. 
And uh, it's story the same two three years uh in a row, the fourth was- was strongest. 
Uh generally, we believe that this should post uh circa 400 million revenues this year 
um but there are certain big contracts um with very large enterprises. 
They're underway uh that actually may kind of be a slim factor here, right, so of course anxiously. 
Next uh 
next quarter uh therefore, it's- I think Skillus at this point of time uh when they acquired new customers uh quite intensively, 
they're a bit of a less kind of predictable and um compared to inaudible. 
But we expect a strong quarter. 
And the- the last one I think is- is quite uh, the right one it's exactly in line with our thinking that in- in today's environment we see 
a lot of opportunities in- in adjacent areas and many of them could be uh actually tackled kind 
of quicker in more efficient way via some small stage acquisitions 
um and uh actually we're currently active in- on the search out for this type ofâ€¦ 
That is why uh Skillus, Trimjob, uh Usel, et cetera. So we, I would say we are guided on quite 
high uh like acquisitions uh will come over the next uh two three years pursuing these returns. 
Hmm, good, thank you very much. Thank you and the next question comes from the line of Luke 
Hobart from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead. 
First, thank you for letting me on the call. Congratulations on a- on a strong first result. Um 
I just had a question on market share dynamics, given your strong revenue performance this quarter, I just wondered if you could comment a bit on- on what you were seeing in the regions in particular, 
uh how has the Zaplata changed that dynamic a bit as well uh particularly around Siberia regions 
and do you feel that you're- that you're gaining share at this point in time. And- and then I've just got a follow up after that, thank you. 
Yes sure um Luke, thanks for question. Um well regional business is performing uh stronger than in terms of uh growth than uh in the capital cities, uh in Moscow and in St. Petersburg, 
it's uh 
110 percentage growth and uh in particular in the Zaplat region and the Urals and Siberia, it's one of the strongest 
uh areas where we have the probably the biggest market share, 
even compared to Moscow. 
We recently made inaudible and 
that actually kind of 
resulted in the qui- quite astonishing fact that recently over- over 95 percent of all applications in uh in foreign language for example 
and so it's like the- the whole market delivers just 5 percent if you take out the uh us and Zeporten. 
So it's a very- very strong uh strong regions. 
Also Zaplat is uh slightly underperforming HeadHunter and I think it we were always guided this 
because they're deprived of certain benefits of uh nationwide very assertive marketing 
that we are enjoying. Therefore their revenue's not growing as fast as uh as HeadHunter's. So we've kind of grabbing share from Zaplata but uh combined with Zaplata, collectively we definitely in uh an ever strong position so and 
I think that- that actually kind of inaudible a lot of inaudible potential as well for us. 
Okay, thanks and- and just in terms of then your- your marketing spend that you mentioned there, is there a certain region or product focus or 
um are you targeting more blue collar or white collar, would you split it like that internally? Any- any color there would be useful. 
Yeah, your question is quite 
right. Uh were we are I don't think I can give you the um uh kind of details by- by marketing total or by segment 
because for kind of competition reasons, we prefer not to go into the uh- uh so much uh 
the detail, 
right? But um what I probably could tell you is that 
um in uh in the second quarter this year and the third as well, we are strengthening uh marketing and this um uh brand awareness for more sections uh outdoor campaign for instance. And uh performance marketing 
uh- uh 
as well um as we see uh kind of high demand for candidates uh and uh also on the back of kind of low activity of job seekers. 
So, we think it makes all the sense to 
um, to uh spend more for audience acquisition to balance with demand uh for inaudible efficiency for customers who are essentially paying 
extra nowadays uh to get their recruitment going. 
Um so uh we are 
frankly increasing across- across the board. For instance we have a significant outdoor campaign in uh Moscow recently 
and we saw uh a sizable increase in uh top of mind brand awareness by 38 percent 
um for I'd say 8 percentage points probably to uh 
66 percent. Um according to our last uh merger uh. 
We also see traffic going up at around uh between twenty and thirty percent as we increase more in digital- 
in digital channels 
so um it's across the board and rather successful. 
Great, thank you very much. That's very clear. Great, thank you very much. That's very clear. Thank you, and the next question comes from the line of Dimitri 
Glassow from Wooden Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Uh. Yes. 
Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask question. I have two please. 
Uh. The first one, uh, could you please break down the revenue growth for fourth quarter 
of 2021. Basically, uh, what came as a result of, uh, inaudible and 
what came from the organic growth, and, uh, uh, what came from the- this labor market, uh, deficit, so to speak? 
Uh, the other question is on the- the economy. Uh. 
If you could maybe comment on, um, how big do you see the total inaudible market opportunity here? 
Uh, like what's the, uh, opportunity now and uh how big could it become 
once the transition from the gray market to the legal one, uh, will occur? Thank you. 
inaudible. I will handle both. 
Um. On, on, on the first one, uh, if we try to decompose this, uh, the growth, in, in the third quarter, 103%, or 
in absolute terms, 2.4 billion, 
um, yeah, we can actually inaudible organic growth and kind of more sustainable organic, right, so, uh, in 
terms of inaudible, we, it's, it's obviously, it's arbitrary, right, because it's, it, it depends on what inaudible your set is based from last year, 
uh, but we estimate that it's around 15% of the 103%, um, which is equal to, uh, 350 
million, that is inaudible, so 
the percentage is, uh, obviously going down, compared to Q2, for obvious reason. 
Then, um, more or less equal, uh, impact, uh, game or drive from inorganic growth, around 15% or 350 
million, uh, that's our collect impact from inaudible consolidation this year. 
And then, uh, so effectively if you would take out this two buckets, 30% then remaining 70% or 1.7 billion 
rubles could be also broken into three major guiding group inaudible consideration. 
First monetization, second, client based expansion, and the third, consumption growth, right? 
So the first, uh, explains circa 40% of that 1.7 billion, 
uh, that's monetization or client based inaudible and coupled with inaudible new subscription model. 
The key contributors are inaudible products performing exceptionally well this year. 
Um, then 25%, uh, of 1.7 billion relates to increased, uh, consumption of services. 
That, that's, uh, if, impact of the market situation then labor force shortage and the general low candidate activity in the market. 
Uh, we discussed last time, some part of it probably diminish over time so it's inaudible semi-sustainable, uh, 
because we see that, uh, for example, a small inaudible businesses, they consume twice, twice bigger, uh, product, packages then we usually do. 
And the remaining 35% is the, the customer based expansion, predominant to small, medium businesses, predominantly regions 
so that, that inaudible, our, our marketing and investments and B2B channels, our product adoption platform, adoption et cetera. 
And, uh, that's the most encouraging number because it's just helping us to grow the base which we can monetize in, uh, in the future. 
So generally if you compare Q2, 
uh, the inaudible the monetization sect, uh, went up, the, the other buckets, uh, more or less, the same. 
And the, the second, the second question was on inaudible economy, 
uh, yeah, I think we, we touched upon this, uh, but, yeah, inaudible, um, that 
generally, we will see, uh, globally that the independence will 
inaudible workforce constitutes up to 30% or not up to, on, on average, 
30%, uh, of labor forces, 
quite stable, um, measure, if you look at, so the inaudible including that unofficial, uh, gray market, that's only 15%. 
And, uh, of course, the like 95% of that, uh, 15%, uh, currently in the gray zone 
and, because they are very limited and since 
it's created, uh, and upon the legislation change and inaudible we saw huge intake and the registration of, uh, 
like, self-registered, so we, we believe, at the moment, there are, uh, inaudible around two million, uh, self-employed. 
And we expect actually this number to grow, uh, say, 10, 10X, up to 20 million, and in the next three to five years. 
So that, that's a huge emerging market, all right, for us. 
It, it's highly dynamic and, uh, not only, uh, the inaudible matter, but also the business model that could be applied to 
matters because it's, uh, if you compare results, additional, kind of permanent work, it's much easier in this market to inaudible the transaction, all right, because it's more frequent, frequent market. 
It's, it's quite similar to what we see in inaudible equipment. 
And, uh, before they, it's much easier to inaudible so it's very sticky, potentially if, if you're, if you'll have it, 
if you're successful in a inaudible, especially big enterprises. 
And so that's our strategy together with, uh, 
inaudible, 
um, we kind of officially declared this, uh, strategic inaudible in June then we tried to kind of test this solution with, uh, with the clients. Interaction was exceptional. 
So we decided to invest, uh, in inaudible, 
as a kind of minority partner at this stage, 
but, of course, it's a strategic type transaction for us. We were having and securing all the necessary best, best to control in future. 
You can consult it as business, should it actually take off in the end. 
But we are very optimistic and it seems, 
in the end it seems, uh, temporary market contingent market could be bigger in monetary terms than the permanent, uh, source of market. 
Thank you very much. Very clear. 
Thank you and, uh, no further questions have came through. I will now like to hand the gavel inaudible back to your speaker Dimitri inaudible, you line is now open, sir, you may go ahead. 
Yeah, thank you operator. Um, yeah, there's just a few, few remarks. The first inaudible, thanks for your participation, 
uh, this is the last, uh, quarterly call for, for this year. Eh, time flies by quickly. 
Uh, needless to say that this has been an outstanding quarter for us in terms of financial results, it's probably the best quarter we've had since we've gone public. 
Uh, it's really nice to see how a strategic execution of holding, 
we, we show just how we can really continue to grow clients while concurrently rolling out differentiated monetization. 
So it speaks of the inaudible of the inaudible of the market, right? It speaks of the kind of pricing power, rising of our competitive position. 
But what, what's even more encouraging, I think, that it kind of stamps from the, the question, uh, we just received from, from inaudible, on the inaudible markets. 
In, in, in this challenging kind of inaudible we can clearly see, uh, that the process of kind of rethinking and upgrading the role which are function 
and HR funding within organizations 
so coupled with the inaudible interactions, uh, inaudible online inaudible opportunities, uh, beyond our traditional market boundaries. 
Uh, this is already evident in our results, in, uh, inaudible service performance including skill dynamics, uh, in our experiments with inaudible jobs and inaudible, 
so we just want to stress that for us, as the market leader, uh, in traditional market, it's really important. We have the best position to kind of catch this opportunity. 
It, it's important strategic task to, to lead the next wave inaudible Russia. 
That's our mission and a goal for years to come. Thanks for attention. Have a great week. Bye-bye. 
Thank you. That concludes our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.
