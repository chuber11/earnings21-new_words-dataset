Dear all, thank you very much for joining Nidec conference call. 
I am inaudible, General Manager Joseph brands of Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. 
As we kick off the conference, 
I'd like to ask you to make sure all the materials are already in front of you. If not, please download the files on Nidec's homepage right now. 
Please note, this call is being recorded and the conference materials will be posted on Nidec's homepage for the coming week 
for investors and analysts 
who are not able to join today's call. 
Now, I'd like to introduce today's attendees from Nidec Corporation. 
Mr. June Saki, Representative Director, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Hello everyone. Uh, this is Saki. Mr. Hitotoshi Yokota 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Hello everyone. This is Hitotoshi Yokota. 
First, Mr. Yokota will make a presentation. 
After his presentation then we move to, move on to a Q and A session, and the Mr. Saki and Mr. Yokota will 
answer your question. 
Mr. Yokota now present Nidec Q3 fiscal year 2021 results, future outlook, and management strategy. 
Mr. Yokota, please go ahead. 
Thank you inaudible-son. Uh, good day everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. 
My name is Hitotoshi Yokota, you, Chief Financial Officer of Nidec. 
Today, Mr. June Seki, Representative Director, 
President, and Chief Executive Officer of Nidec, and myself, will be your main speakers and answer your questions. 
Joining us also is Mr. Masahiro Naga Yasa. General Manager of Nidec IRT. 
For a well-looking statement, please see slider two of our presentation material for details. 
Now, I'm going to read you the key features 
precisely for the fiscal year ' 21, nine months result. 
As shown on slide four, nine months net sales to a record high of one trillion, 47.2 billion, 
18.8% higher year 
on year. Nine months operating profit and profit before income tax 
increase 16.6% year on year to 134.6 billion, 
19.4% year on year to 130.6 billion respectively, 
also at a record high. 
Q3, uh, quarterly net sales increased 
by 7.2% quarter on quarter, to now 496.5 billion, 
marking our record high for three consecutive quarters. 
Based on this result, 
we have made an upward revision on IR and dividends focused by variant developing 
in the period projected aggregate annual dividend of 65 yen per share for fiscal 
year ' 21. For slide five and six, 
you have a picture 
showing the net sales and operating profit year on year and quarter on quarter respectively, by product group will exchange late effect elimination and structural reform expenses. 
As you can see on slide six, all of the segments increase their net sales, quarter on quarter 
with levers to operating profit, 
appliance, commercial and industrial or ACI declined due to increased material costs. 
However, small precision motor and automotive increase despite this adverse, uh, backdrop. 
Machinery decline as the September quarter had a one-off profit increase related to the acquisition 
and factory and optical components and others made an increase. 
Please see slide 10. 
We are aiming to become number one automotive hardware manufacturer by anticipating the strong, uh, electrification demand boosted by case 
which means connected autonomous and shelling and AFD. 
In the EV structure motor-related business, mass production of EXO at the joint venture with, uh, 
inaudible is expected to start in the second half of fiscal year ' 22 in addition to those being mass produced in China. 
We are also receiving new orders from Chinese, European, and Japanese OEMs as well as US, EV startups and, um, 
newcomers from other industries and the turning point of fiscal year ' 25 gets close. 
In other motors and the auto parts, 
we have prepared and continued to prepare highly competitive product lineups in Adas or Advanced Driver Assistance System 
for our inaudible Shashi and body area. 
With those product group 
we are aiming to achieve one to one yen net sale organically and 300 billion yen additional net sales through M and A in fiscal year ' 25 in the automotive segment. 
Please see slide 11. 
The Chinese party EV or battery electric vehicle market, the largest in the world, 
achieved dramatic growth of over 150% entering into explosive high growth period. 
In calendar year 2021, not only domestic sales in China but also exports from China to oversea, 
overseas countries progressing quite rapidly and supporting increase of overall shipments. 
With regard to the Made in China high in BEV landscape on the left hand side of the slide 
that US company P is expanding sales through exporting their mai- main product models made in the Shanghai factory to Europe. 
And the Chinese company ENS has announced to export vehicles to over 25 countries and regions by 2025. 
Please see slide 12. 
The total sales volume of the 10 EV model 
using our E-axles has exceeded along 2657 units on a cumulative, uh, 
basis as, as of the end of last December 
and the sales volume in calendar year 2021 doubled compared to the previous year. 
The monthly product production is exceeding 20,000 units, uh, from last November. 
Please see slide 13. 
We are going to invest around 300 million to enable vertical startup to prepare for the EV turning point of fiscal year ' 25. 
In addition to the six factories that are up and running or being built, 
we are planning a more global production site 
and we are going to prepare double the production capacity of expected sales volume in fiscal year ' 25. 
Please see slide 14. 
The profitability of quarter three fiscal year ' 25, ' 21 form a bottom as a result of lost sales due to, uh, chip shortage 
and high low material price as inserted, illustrated on the right hand side of the slide. 
Please see slide 15. 
Another emphasis from us on internal combustion engine vehicle to EV 
is rapidly accelerating in two wheel and compact cars as well. 
In the mobility area, the electric motorcycle, uh, formed mainly in India, China and ASEAN country 
is expected to enter high growth period due to environmental measures. 
We are currently focusing on two major markets of India and China, and have already studied mass production of models for major customers. 
In the mini EV area 
we have already received orders from major customers in the Chinese market and sturdy mass production from fiscal year ' 22. 
We consider these business areas as one of the most important growth drivers in small precision motors in vision 2025. 
Please see slide 16. 
Nidec small precision motor division start a shift to mobility in fiscal year ' 22 with launching multiple project, 
project for electric motorcycle and the mini EVs. 
As illustrated on the left hand slide, side of the slide, 
our motors have been adopted by China's largest electric motorcycle manufacturer, Yadea. 
For the first time and actual shipment study last September, 
the annual global market size of motorcycle is estimated at around 60 million unit, 
the largest market being in India, followed by China and Indonesia. 
As ever electrification of motorcycles is progressing, 
electric motorcycle are expected to become rapidly, uh, widespread mainly in these countries and regions. 
As shown on the right hand 
slide, 
side of the slide, we are receiving increasing orders from motors used in electric motorcycle and mini EVs 
that are under 30 kilowatt and in, in mass production within fiscal year ' 22 for around 10%. 
Please see slide 17. 
We are implementing business portfolio transformation in HDD motor market structural change, 
that sales of other small motors in quarter three has achieved record high as HDD sales decline due to reduced HDD shipment foreign. 
Please see slide 18. 
In ACI, uh, we are, uh, executing structural reform in overseas pieces and looking to enter a new phase open log 
while estimating CAGR of the market at the 
3% to 5%, we aim to grow ACI sales to CAGR of 10% to 11% by creating new demand through solution proposal in markets, such as inaudible 
where structural change is occurring. 
Please see slide 19. 
In ACI we are continuing to aim for 15% operating profit ratio, even though profitability improvement slowed down after progressing for six consecutive quarters, uh, since Q4 fis- fiscal year 19. 
Please see slide 20. 
In other product groups, operating profit ratio is keeping high level after bottoming out in quarter four, fiscal year ' 19. 
Please see slide 21. 
Nidec board of directors has approved the resolution to purchase the share of OKK corporation or OKK, 
through a third party allocation of common shares in the meeting of Board of Directors held last November 
and we have executed a capital Alliance agreement with OKK regarding this share purchase. 
This share purchase enable, 
um, um, mutual, uh, complement of products in the area of machine two, which is an existing area of Nidec business. 
Synergy, uh, is expected especially in such areas, uh, element technology development, 
manufacturing and sales over machine to business by Nidec manufacturing to the corporation, which joined the Nidec group last August. 
By joining Nidec via, uh, the share power just OKK will make a, a fresh restart as a comprehensive machine two market maker and enhance its product lineup as well as a sales capability while quickly e- e- enforcing its production capacity as well. 
After the share purchase, 
we entered into further expand Nidec machine two business and believe that it can grow globally at a faster pace by making necessary investments where they are needed on timely basis. 
We hope to mutually explore our groups and OKK respective technological capability, brand power, and the customer base to contribute to the development of the machine two market on global, global scale. 
Last but not least, on behalf of the entire management team, 
we would like to thank our customers, partners, suppliers for their support and commitment, as well as our shareholders. 
At this time, we would like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Yokota. Now we'd like to turn to the Q and A session. 
Senior management of Nidec will be pleased to answer your questions. Today's Q and A session will be conducted, uh, electronically. 
If you'd like to ask a question, please press star key and one on your touch phones. 
Again, please press star and one if you'd like to ask a question. 
If you'd like to cancel your request, please press star and two. 
We now pause for questions from the participants. 
Okay, our first question today is from Arma Capital, 
uh, James inaudible. Uh, uh, James, please go ahead. 
inaudible thank you very much for your, uh, your presentation. 
Uh, can I ask about the, 
uh, a little bit more detail about the margin decline 
in, uh, 
in ACI and also on a, in your materials it was different but on a reported basis in, uh, in autos, margins also slipped a little bit. Uh, 
I'm aware that, I'm aware that costs- inaudible slipped a little bit. Uh, and I'm aware that- I'm aware that costs uh, our raw material costs, perhaps shipping costs have- have- have gone up. 
But if you could- if you could perhaps break that down a little bit 
and also comment on uh, what you are trying to do to offset that and the degrees in which you may be able to recover that in pricing for some of the products, but perhaps not other ones. 
Uh, and so we get a better feel for what we think's likely to happen over the next uh, six months in that area. Thank you. 
Okay, uh, this is inaudible speaking. Uh, let- let me respond uh the question uh, for the uh, material cost and uh, maybe shipping cost James. 
For uh, the shipping costs, yes, uh, we are impacted. Especially the uh, the shipment cost in the inaudible of between uh, China and uh, US or China and Europe. 
Uh, we uh, estimated the impact to ACI in quarter three is inaudible and 
uh, maybe automotive for inaudible. Uh, those are the uh, impact of uh, uh, inaudible cost increase. 
For the uh, uh, material market, uh, material price increase. 
This happens mainly- mainly uh, the magnetic steel, uh price increase in this period. 
Even though the price increase uh, is still con- continence trend uh, from uh, our last quarter or last, last quarter, 
but uh, this time Q3 we tried to uh, offset uh, this uh, price increase by asking customer to absorb the impact by increasing supply. 
But uh, we have, it took a little bit longer than expected and we can not absorb uh, the cost, uh, completely. So, that's why. 
Uh, 
normally uh, we say, uh, one percent, uh, impact uh, is still inaudible after all the, uh, negotiation with customer. 
But this time, Q3 is estimated two percent remain because of the delay in the uh, negotiation with the customer. 
Uh, we especially the magnetic steel, uh, it is typically there is no um, surcharge contract. 
Like either copper or aluminum, those are normally we have a- a surcharge contract with the customer, but the steel and the magnetic steel 
there is uh, uh, no uh, surcharge contract. It's a negotiation basis. 
The reason why, maybe you- you- you know very well in the situation, but 
magnetic steel, especially in the Europe area, 
all the steel manufacturer, all the capacity is almost occupied by European uh, automotive OEM due to increase- increasing the spike in the uh, EV production. 
So, that's why high end uh, magnetic steel already occupied and all the steel maker shift their production to high end 
side. So, therefore inaudible 
we normally use regular magnetic steel, and the capacity of those steel is quite limited due to that shift 
in the steel manufacturer. 
So, that's why our uh, uh, purchase price increase and inaudible mainly in the ACI area. 
Of course uh, we use uh, uh, magnetic steel in the automotive area as well, 
but uh, ACI is main- mostly impacted uh, by magnetic steel impact. 
So, let's say, inaudible uh, this time are the material cost inaudible spike is roughly 
uh, inaudible. That 
is 
a impact so that which is almost double than regular- regular quarter due to the uh, delay in the- in the price negotiation with the 
customer. inaudible. I also want to answer the last question. Uh, how do we see the market? Of course we don't have crystal ball uh, in- in the- in the market supply, 
but uh, at this point uh, for quarter four, 
this trend is still there. Uh, for example, uh, there is no solution for the capacity and inaudible steel manufacturer in the Europe. 
Uh, China situation is a little bit easy. 
So the- the, we see a little bit of stability in the uh, steel price in China. 
But the still, the European, uh, the type of situation continue so we still need to fight against this price increase. 
And other commodity, uh, it- it depends. Uh, some, uh, it's steel high price and some start declining. But some climbing again. 
So it's 
a bit difficult for us to foresee. But uh, we- we expect that Q4 is still going through the pressure than Q3. Now, that's a general uh, assumption for us. 
That's great. And just as a- as a follow up, in terms of these price increases uh, shipping, raw materials, things you've got coming through, 
uh, what- what proportion of those, obviously there may be a lag of three months or- or even sort 
of longer, but what proportion of those do you think is it realistic for you to pass onto your customers or 
is there a- is there a proportion of that, maybe a half or uh, a third, 
that you won't be able to pass on and you will have to- you will have to sort of find through internal cost savings and rationalization? 
Yeah, uh, lastly, uh, normally we try to absorb or uh, put in the price than try to absorb, 
uh, 60-70 %, or even more, 
uh out of a total uh, materiel cost increase. 
So, uh, lastly, lastly, uh, every quarter, the low figure for the material cost inaudible let's say like a full percent uh, against a turn 
over. So, that- we try to absorb three percent by uh, asking- asking uh, material- material supplier 
to absorb inaudible or 
we do some technical arrangement inaudible or ask customer to uh, to increase the price. So, we 
say three percent out of four percent to be absorbed. 
But this time, Q3, uh, we couldn't absorb three percent, let's say two percent only. So, that two percent 
remain. And that inaudible it depends on the material but uh, in short- short- short uh, one is like one quarter, inaudible one quarter. 
But maybe long one is uh, maybe a half a year. 
So it depends on the customer and it depend on- on our share in the market and the relationship with the customer. 
So, there's some range uh, for us to cure the price absorption in- in- in those periods. Yeah. 
But if you- you, but you say you normally would internally absorb 60-70 %, so you would- you would take the 60-70 % of the hit, 
uh, in this- this environment where the increase is rather large 
do you still expect to- to have to internally absorb 60-70 and the- the price increase will cover just- just uh, 30-40? Will that be, 
is that the plan? Is that just crosstalk. Uh, 
James, uh, maybe let me precisely state it. So, 60-70 %, this 
is a combination of internal effort and price transfer. 
So, still the remaining piece to be absorbed 
in next quarter or- or further negotiation with customer. Okay. But sorry, inaudible in terms in price transfer, as to uh, well, your supplies, the price has gone up, 
so what 
percentage, how much is the- the increase would you expect normally to pass onto customers and 
what do you expect to be the case uh, on- on this occasion when the increase is rather large? 
inaudible. Let- 
let me reply. Thank you James. This is inaudible speaking. 
Thank you. To- to answer that, can we go page 19? Yeah. Yeah. 
You know, uh, left hand side is sales and right hand side is profit. We're talking about sales. 
And then inaudible is a total appliance commercial in the industry and 
the green one is uh, more like a, inaudible. And then uh, both have the same tendencies, keep increasing. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. But you know, 
uh, why inaudible sales is increasing. Reality was it was a bit difficult to tell customer we want to increase price. 
You know. Uh, we- we- we inaudible to supply more 
and then uh, also our profit is generated by increase over materials 
but we have more revenues. 
And because we have more revenues inaudible goes down and then we can expect inaudible at 
least inaudible our profit amount is more. 
That uh, happened from like uh, inaudible last fiscal year to inaudible this fiscal year. 
And then um, actual damage getting bigger and bigger 
than Q3, because maybe uh, we have a- a December, Christmas period, 
and also uh, we believe uh, we feel 
uh, saturation from like a fridge or you know, air conditionings. 
So, sales came down 
then we decided to tell customers now we need to compensations. 
Uh, that was the- the attitude. 
And then you know, even we say Q3, you know, November, up- up- up to October, to- to beginning of November it was still inaudible 
and then we uh, started to negotiate with customer, but it was soft. 
We see career downtrend from end of November til December. 
So, we became very uh, aggressive attitude to customers. 
And then finally uh, we uh, fully negotiated with most of the customer, let's say 95% of the customer, 
by the end of December or beginning of January. 
So, uh, that was a- a impact. If we go back to page six. 
Page six, this is Q2 versus Q3. Upper side is sales, lower side is profit. 
You see obvious impact in the middle uh, appliance commercial industry. 
Uh, uh, this is caused by that delay, okay? 
But as I said, we finally negotiated inaudible and then this will come back in Q4, 
unless we have a extra, extra increase and then we may have to push that out to Q1. 
It may change, but uh, at least this big deficit we- we created in Q3 that was, uh, already concluded 
inaudible in Q4. Then 
go back to your uh, questions. 
Uh, usually uh, this type of uh, uh, material increase doesn't last long. 
Sometimes uh, let's say, six months, sometimes even just one quarter. And then we have uh, enough savings to absorb. 
This uh, magnetic steel increase 
started from almost one half year ago and then it's keep increasing with almost non-stop. 
So, you know, general… Answer to your questions. We definitely absorb at least 50%. 
But because, you know, our savings is getting less and less because this continued long- long. 
So, from now on, probably we have to request customer to offset this increase, 
uh, very much. That- that way it continue. 
And then our forecast is this uh, magnetic steel increase will not stop til like ' 23, 
' 24, so uh, discussion may become very harsh with customers, but we also have to protect our profit 
at which we can not lose money to sales. So, uh, that- that what we are seeing, but meanwhile you 
know, uh, we know this is not sustainable 
and then now I'm giving the pressure to our engineerings to uh, choose alternative materials or reduce quantity inaudible magnetic steel, 
or- or manufacturing engineering can increase inaudible from one inaudible. 
You know, usually to have a large motor core inaudible uh, 55-60 
% remain, uh, 40-45 
% going to scrap. 
Because we get the money to scrap inaudible, but not the original price. 
So, now I'm requesting them to increase this inaudible rate from current 55-60 % to like uh, 70-75 %. 
That will help a lot. 
So, end of the day not only magnetic steel, but also magnetic itself, coppers, inaudible, 
uh, you know, technology will 
define, uh, cost inaudible. Uh, inaudible we strategically won. 
So, this time again we appreciate engineering to save the situations. 
So, uh, 
to, story short, we want to go inaudible 
you know, one, more price negotiation with customer, 
uh, as long as this keep increasing. And then two, uh, more technology to reduce quantity or increase inaudible. That's 
what we are going to most. But, you know, inaudible continues very long. That is uh, very much painful. Right. Tremendous. 
Thank you for that very complete answer. 
That's great, thank you. Thank you. James, thank you very much. 
For those who have just joined the conference call let me repeat how you can ask your question to the company senior management. 
Today's Q&A session is being conducted electronically. 
If you would like to ask a question please press star key and one on your touch tone phone. 
Again, please press star and one if you'd like to ask a question. 
If you'd like to cancel your request please press star and two. 
If you would like to cancel your request please press star and two. 
Now, uh, our next question is from- Our next question is from Mark Aim of Gam Co. 
Mark, please go ahead. Uh, thank you very much, uh, for that. I- 
I just want to follow up on the previous, um, question about magnetic steel. 
Just to confirm, this is mainly an issue in your European operations or is it pretty much, um, company wide the same, uh, the same effect? crosstalk Okay, okay. 
Thank you Mark. Let- let me reply from inaudible. 
Uh, it- it- it's global actually. 
But particularly from Europe. Uh, two reasons, okay? Uh, it's highly related with electrifications. 
You know, electrifications are accelerating but, uh, uh, particularly two major market, one in Europe and one in China. 
If we look at the North America and Japan, uh, in other market, it's not, uh, aggressive as Europe and China's. 
Then Europe, uh- uh- uh electrification inaudible hybrid, uh, 
December sales has already reached more than 20% among, uh, new car sales. 
The original forecast was uh, around 10% by the end of ' 21 so it's almost double, so it very much, uh, accelerated. 
And then obviously, you know, inaudible and 
then naturally it required uh- uh, high quantity of magnetic steels. 
Uh, that's one of the reasons but, uh, 
inaudible OEM in Europe want to go more for ' 22 and ' 
23 and then, there in… they did start reserving, uh, you know, uh, magnetic steel for next year and after next year. 
Uh, that makes a difficult- difficult for appliance applications or industry applications to get, uh, magnetic steel 
because, uh, automotive OEM is, uh, you know, dominating force. 
And then, uh, of course, uh, for, uh, steel companies, 
uh, uh, you know, uh, high sales brings a better profit. It's better. And 
I think uh, automotive application required, uh, you know, very, uh, long process to make it thin- 
thinner and then a good price and a good profit for them 
than appli- uh, appliance application or industry applications. 
That happening in Europe. 
And then China supposed to be same but, uh, China has a- a little more steel capacity than Europe against the demand. 
So that's what you inaudible. It's similar but the capacity, uh, uh, uh supply point of view, uh, 
China has little more inaudible than Europe, 
okay? Uh, overall because of that demand, uh, in the case of demand in Europe and China, uh, globally this magnetic steel is showing a shortage 
but, uh, it's coming from, uh, uh, Europe. 
That is the background. 
Uh, thanks for that. 
Just, um, a- a- are you e- e- expanding your suppliers of magnetic steel or- or looking into, um, 
I don't know, investment in that area yourself over the long term? 
Uh, uh, we have a similar action for this. 
Obviously, we are not going to have a steel mill by ourselves. We cannot control that but, uh… 
One, uh, because globally, China a little more room for adjustment, 
we decided to have a- a huge import from China to Europe for appliance applications and industry applications. 
Of course, that cost a lot but because European cost is already very high, uh, even paying logistic cost and import duties, 
uh, im- imported from China, a- a- almost similar or a little less. 
So, uh, we reserved up to, uh, inaudible uh, we need to continue this for probably ' 23 and ' 24. 
That's first one. And second one, uh, this is, has not been fully decided yet but, uh, uh generally speaking, 
uh, automotive application, uh, is thinner than, uh, industrial applications. 
For example, uh, one plate thickness for automotive, uh, particularly traction motor, 
is let's say .25 millimeter to .27 millimeters 
while industry application is, let's say, .35 to .40. 
Uh- uh, this thickness is created by, uh, uh, times of loadings. 
That means, uh, automotive industry application needs, uh, more loading times. 
Yeah. And then because steel mill only making, uh, application for, uh, automotive side, 
uh, very difficult for industry and appliance to get, uh, 
it, uh, their standard thickness. 
So what we have studied, uh, 
you know, it may become uh, expensive but supply is more important 
so that is inaudible studying if we can use automotive industry application for appliance and the industries. 
Then instead, you know, uh, efficiency become a little higher. 
So let's say while we usually use uh, 150, we may be able to reduce to 135, 
uh, with thinner, uh, magnetic steel. 
That- that we are studying. 
But uh, now automotive is dominating and therefore, uh, minor users such industry applications or appliance application may have to follow, uh, automotive standard. 
Uh, that we are studying. 
But probably we have uh, many other, uh, choice and uh, way of adjustment we have to squeeze out to survive. 
Okay, thank you. And I'm sorry, just one more question. This is about your acquisition of OKK. 
Can you explain the background of that? I know you have exposure to uh, machine tools and you've uh, M&A in that uh, area, like with Mitsubishi. 
Why OKK and what is your longterm plan for machine tools? 
Okay, um, maybe I go first and them maybe uh- uh, inaudible you can add a comment later. 
Uh, fi- first, you know, 
uh, we 
believed uh, electrification from uh, automotive side will grow very rapidly. And then we are very strong to build motors. 
But we are not so strong for gear. 
You know? Uh, when you- you are thinking of gear for manual transmissions, 
and a gear for ele- EVs, it's very different. You know? Functionally the same 
you know, transfer uh, you know, rotation power to wheels, yeah. 
But you know uh, as you have experienced before, uh, manual transmission vehicle is uh, very you 
know, uh, uh, fun to drive. At the same time, very noisy. 
Yeah? And no one cares when a manual transmission is noisy with sound from the engine too. Yeah. 
But once changing to EVs, very quiet, at least no combustion sounds. 
So sound from gear become very you know, noisy. 
Actually same or much less noise and vibrations as a manual transmission. 
But because entire sounds and vibration become uh, smaller, uh, that sound from gear become outstanding. 
Then too, control disks. 
We need a very precise machining and grinding for gear. 
And then 
uh, uh, we- we hired many experts from uh, gear areas. 
But we finally found that the best way is acquire the best quality machine builders. 
That was Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Machine Tool Division. And now they're in our hand. 
And then at the same time we found that you know, 
uh, to complete this machining area, 
we need uh, not only for gear machining or gear grinding, but also standard machining centers, 
uh, then uh, we also found that uh, this uh, segment, uh, way of competition is very soft. 
So usually they have a standard price, depending on brand, sales power. They have a plus minus 10 perfect price gap. 
But because many of time they have a trading company to reach final users. 
And then uh, because of those structures, commercial and business, 
uh, they are ranking from number one to number 10, has no change for 40 years, very, very soft competition. 
So our chairman, uh, Mr Namori, uh, determined, let's- let's go into the uh, segment. 
It's not difficult to get in. 
So while we had a machine- machine tools, uh, which used to be a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, 
uh, we decided to find a good machine- machining center builders. 
And then OKK has a very good engineering history and uh 
asset. But their business was terrible. You know? 
They had a huge negative profit for, from ' 20 and possibly ' 21. 
So uh, therefore uh, it's not expensive to purchase. 
So there was uh, uh, background we bought. 
And also, this combination uh, machine tool and OKK, also help a lot to make a- uh, inaudible as well. 
And then this is also another we believe extend uh, very much from the future, our future there. 
So uh, while we are making these structures, uh, you know, our idea is expanding. 
Probably we need this company and we need this company. This company will help a lot to sell in China or USA. 
So we really inaudible and then uh, 
Mr. Namori is very energize to make this machine tool division bigger and uh, 
uh inaudible. But to go back to your first questions, you know, original background and it's still background, but 
uh, not to sell outside, but to uh, help uh, internal business such as uh- uh, inaudible that- that 
is background. 
Potentially we can expand this to very strong. 
inaudible if you have any additional comments. 
Yeah, just to uh, just simple uh, explanation on top of uh- uh Mr. Sake explained. 
Uh- uh, inaudible machine tool its uh, lineup is for more like larger size of machining. 
Of course uh, one of the uh, benefits that we get is uh, gearing and technology. 
But their product line is mainly on the high 
end inaudible. Uh, on the other hand, OKK uh, is very good at uh, mid size or small size machining center. 
If we really uh, try to be successful in the machining business, 
we need a product lineup because we have to access all of the potential customers in everywhere. 
We cannot compete only one product in a very, very wide range of product, uh, competition. 
So that's why OKK is uh, very essential to add uh, uh, such variety of lineup on top, on top of uh, inaudible 
machine tool, uh, which is very good at large size, uh, machining center. 
So this is also one of the biggest motivation for us to pursue OKK. 
Thank you very much. 
Mark, thank you very much. Uh, we have a few more minutes to accommodate, uh, some questions. 
And uh, there seems to be a new question from uh, Zack inaudible Securities America. 
Zack, please go ahead. Oh, good morning uh, and good evening y'all. Thank you for hosting uh, this timely call, uh once again. Uh, 
I have some questions on your production capacity for your E 
axle. Uh, first of all, congratulations on reaching 20000 mile, uh, production last month. 
And on the inaudible 13 I know you have the capacity to increase to 16 million units in FI 
24. Uh, so you know, rough calculation, that's about 500000 units per month, that's you know, 25 times greater than the last month. 
So my two questions from me, uh one, uh, based on your current customer inquiries, 
uh, what is your ex- expected, or estimated order, uh, orders, for E axle in FI 24? 
And uh, my second question is uh, when do you think the orders from non Chinese auto companies, uh, will start to kick in? 
Uh, thank you Zack. Uh, this is inaudible speaking. Let me explain. Uh, first uh, if you are on page 13, 
you know, uh, please look at the uh- uh graph on the right hand side. inaudible capacity that you are seeing and then 
uh, green portion is actual current forecast of production volumes. 
So uh, 3.5 million in ' 25. Okay? 
And then we are not showing uh, this green for ' 24, ' 23, ' 22. Your question was ' 
24 but uh, in ' 22, uh, we are seeing about one million. 
And then uh, we're uh, expecting a inaudible increase from ' 22 to ' 23, ' 24 and ' 25. 
So uh- 
uh, first question, uh, first answer to your question, ' 24 probably around 2.8 or 2- ' 24, around 2.8 or 2.7 millions. 
And then, 
uh, this 3.5 million was a number we announced, uh, at the last, uh, financial announcement in October. 
Actually, this 3.8 already increased to three… 3.5, already increased to 3.8 by 300,000. 
So, you know, 
uh, after discussion with Mr. Nagamori, and we stopped 
to announce this volume increase because time by time, it's not so impactful. 
So instead, probably we, uh, announced this volume increase by every half a year, yeah? 
So we didn't explain this time, but probably in April in explain. 
But time by time, uh, this volume will increase, 
and then, uh, that's why we are aiming, uh, double of capacities, because, 
uh, one day, you know, uh, this, uh, prepared capacity will be fulfilled, and maybe customer won't ask the suppliers. We have no room. 
And then we know, uh, ' 25 is, uh, uh, breaking point, 
you know? Uh, it, it looks very steep cut, but, uh, for us, this is still so, 
after ' 25, uh, speed will increase for adaptation will be even more accelerated. 
Therefore, uh, we need spare capacity to absorb all of those opportunities. 
So that, that, that we are aiming, and then we set this as a strategy, and this strategy is not a fast one. 
We, uh, had a very, uh, huge success for how would this drive by exact same strategies, 
no? Uh, prepared capacity first, and then demand come next, yeah? 
Actually, because we had capacity, demand came. 
If we didn't capacity, you know, uh, everybody were slow, and we are one of them, and then we probably had to share those demands with our competitors, 
no? So, uh, to, uh, repeat that facts yet again, we have this success, okay? 
And then second questions, European customers? Uh, I don't know if your question is excluding, uh, 
strategies, but, uh, we have strategies. Therefore, uh, our delivery to them start from, uh, this Q2. Coming to Q2. 
2022 Q2s. 
Yeah. So, uh, that's first one, and then, uh, I don't know, uh, we should really count strategy as one, but, 
uh, uh, we supply to push our inaudible and Fiat and inaudible, uh, uh, 
and then now we are discussing with, uh, Chrysler as part of strategies, and then, uh, that will come. 
And then, uh, apart from strategies, uh, two things I would like to explain. I, 
I cannot mention, uh, the other name, but, uh, uh, last time, we explained, uh, uh, type customer, customer type A, B, C's. You know? 
A is, uh, you know, strict to be in 
house, and then C is not strict. Uh, you know, they automatically outsource. 
And B is, like, hybrid. Joint ventures, yeah? Uh, strategy is also type B, 
but we are talking about this type A customer. Actually, we don't see clear type C customer in Europe. 
They're either type A or B's. 
And then type A customer start drifting to type A-dash. A-dash 
means, you know, uh, they stick for final assembly, 
but they are abandoning to assemble multi-sales or inaudible sales for gear itself. 
They purchase motor in that, uh, and they affect from outside, and then they keep final assembly in their plant, yeah? 
And then they probably fit with the inaudible traction motor, 
but, uh, anyway, uh, we start to receiving RFQ for motors and in the inaudible for those. 
Uh, therefore, after strategies, I think those parts of business coming, uh, into the European side. 
And then I don't know, yes. No, uh, 
I explain this partially last time as well, 
but, uh, because, uh, most of European inaudible treating, uh, ED as core business, 
I think, uh, they put aside a hybrid business. 
So hybrid business becoming a non-core business from them. 
And then they used to build a hybrid motor in house, or at least like a inaudible suppliers. 
Uh, those shifting to us. 
So we are receiving a lot more of the hybrid. 
Hybrid is a bridging technologies, but it's not disappear for another 10 years at least. 
It will not be increased, but, uh, uh, 
I think, uh, as long as it's continued at least five years or six years, 
uh, we can absorb it, and then we can, uh, get the profit for those. 
So we are receiving many of hybrid motor, hybrid in that, uh, in Europe. 
That, uh, uh, good answering to your questions, inaudible? 
Uh, President Seki, uh, very clear. Uh, very exciting, yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah, thank you very much. 
We still have a few more minutes, and welcome all your questions. 
For those who want to direct your questions to senior management, uh, please press, uh, press… please press star one at this moment. 
Okay, uh, the next question is again from Mark Im of inaudible, and this will be today's final question. Uh, 
Mark, please go ahead. 
Uh, yes, uh, thanks again. 
I know this is a difficult topic to, to discuss, but do you have any comments on the Bloomberg article that appeared on Monday, 
uh, about, uh, Chairman Nagamori and, um, uh, President Seki? 
Thank you, Mark. You know, uh, what I can tell is, 
you know, uh, we don't have any gap, uh, between the, uh, Nagamori reasons or, uh, Mr. Nagamori's philosophy, uh, and my way. 
It, it almost inaudible even one millimeters, yeah? 
So we are, um, fully aligning, and personally, I respect him a lot. 
You know, and then, you know, uh, he's very severe, and then he's my master. 
It's a very natural master train. He's, uh, you know, pupil, uh, be very strong. 
So, uh, I think time by time, he sometimes very harsh, uh, to me to put more output. 
And then, uh, I am okay. 
You know? Uh, you know, he's not telling me any, any wrong, 
so we are fully aligning, 
but you know, first of all, I don't know why Bloomberg made that as articles, 
because, uh, Bloomberg is inaudible, you know, medias, and then, uh, I, 
I think, uh, you know, contents has, uh, many, um, um, misleadings about our relationships and then, you know, company philosophies. 
So, uh, straight answer to your questions, uh, I think, uh, you know, there are no worries, you know? We are still fully alignings. 
And then, 
uh, you know, at this moment, I request him to take care of, uh, uh, every job in Japan. 
And then, uh, while we need a, a, you know, a quick turnaround from automotive divisions, 
he is, uh, uh, turn around in operation in Germany and operations in Mexico. 
So I'm fully spending my time in, uh, Germany and Mexico. Actually, I'm attending this meeting from Germany, yeah? 
And then, uh, last week, I was in Mexico, so, 
so he accepted, uh, uh, me to spend more time in this, uh, Europe and Mexico. 
So, uh, maybe because I am so absent in Japan, people may feel it may be strange, but, 
uh, uh, everything under agreement between Nagamori and myself, uh, no misalignment. That I want to explain. 
Okay, just, uh, what's the issue in Mexico? 
Uh, it's safe. It's, uh, automotive business, and then we have a very, you know, slow operations, 
uh, in terms of, uh, overall efficiency and scrap plate and people's training and qualities 
and inventories. Uh, you know, why do we have a very strong inaudible in Japan and China, Southeast Asia? 
It's a bit slow, uh, to transfer to Europe and then Mexico. 
And then, uh, I've retrained my peoples and then enhancement of business and then, uh, you know, 
built basic strengths as manufacturers that we are doing, and then Mexico one operations. 
Very helpful indeed, thank you. 
Uh, Mark, thank you very much. 
Now we'd like to conclude the conference call. I'd like to appreciate for your participation. 
Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact inaudible Corporation or 
your favorite representative at Mitsubishi Morgan Stanley Securities. 

Again, thank you. 
Japanese. Sorry, uh, 
before we are fully closing, let me make a final remarks. You know, as <unk> explained, uh, you know, our, uh, 
Q3 accumulated sales reaching 1.43 billions, and then Q3 sales itself is, uh, like .53 billions, and 
then, uh, we updated our sales target last time to be, uh, 1.93 billions. Uh, now it's become very, uh, positives. 
And then also, uh, in July, we announced, uh, Vision 2025 to be a, a inaudible in ' 25 at 
a, a very first milestones. Uh, I committed, uh, inaudible by ' 
22, which is another .5, .13 billion if we land 1.9 this year. 
So 2 inaudible is very reachables, and then as we explained through the, uh, 
uh, educations and inaudible, you know, we had, uh, lots of source for further growth, and you know, because inaudible, particularly, uh, machine toward 
building… build ideas, uh, it's very active. 
So, uh, you know, uh, we would make a, a committed growth from next year, this year, next year, 
and then we will approach what we targeted in Vision 2025. 
So, uh, thanks for your support, 
but, uh, uh, at this moment, we have a, a difficulty of, uh, material price and the material supply. 
Uh, it's a very small thing. 
If we look at, uh, two years' bills or three years' bills, 
important point is we have enough strength to grow and then, uh, find strategy to execute. 
So we will be there, and then we will not, uh, betray your exp- expectations. 
Uh, that's final remark from me. Sorry, inaudible. Mr. Seki, thank you very much for your closing remarks. 
Again, uh, I'd like to thank you for, uh, your, uh, joining the conference call, and you may now disconnect. 
Thank you, everyone. See you next time. crosstalk Thank you.
