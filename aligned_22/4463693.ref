Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for joining ELD Electronics Earnings Release conference call for the third quarter of 2021. 
This conference call will start with a presentation on the earnings results, followed by a Q and A session. 
At which time, if you wish to ask a question, you will need to press at star and one on your telephone. 
I would now like to hand the conference over to the first speaker. 
Good afternoon. My name is Ann Buchim from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining ELD Electronics Earnings Release conference call for the third quarter of 2021. 
With me, our representatives of business management division of each business, Mr. Jeong Hee from Home Appliance and Air Solution, Mr. Tony Lee from Home Entertainment, 
Mr. Yun Tae Kim from Vehicle Component Solutions, Mr. Chunyan Park from Business Solutions. 
We are also joined by Mr. Sang Ho Park from Corporate Business Management Division, Mr. Jinghui Li from Finance Division and Mr. Hong Lee from Accounting Division. 
Please note the at all statements we will be making today regarding our financial results of the third quarter are subject to change in accordance with the results of the external review. 
I would also like to remind you that uncertainties in the market and changes in strategies may cause our results to be different from the outlooks and forward looking statements made today. 
Today, I will outline the overall performance results of the third quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
After that each division will take turns to deliver its business results and outlook. 
Now, let me start with the consolidated financial results of the third quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
Consolidated sales of the third quarter was ¥18.8 trillion and operating profit was ¥540.7 billion. Sales 
grew 22% year on year, driven by increased sales of premier menu appliances in HNA and strong sales of Oola TVs in HE. 
So operating profit was affected by the provision for GM bolt recalls. 
We achieved sound performance in profitability by offsetting the impact from rising costs through steady growth in overseas markets and higher sales proportion of premium products. 
I will now briefly review the third quarter performance of each business. 
HNA recorded ¥7.1 trillion in sales, ¥505.4 billion in operating profit and 7.2% in profitability. 
HE recorded ¥4.2 trillion in sales, ¥208.3 billion in operating profit and 5% in profitability. 
DS recorded ¥1.7 trillion million in sales and ¥537.6 billion in operating loss. 
BS recorded ¥1.7 trillion million in sales and ¥12. 3 billion in operating loss. 
Each business will later share its respective business results and outlook in detail. 
Let's move on to the profit and loss and cash flow of the third quarter. 
In terms of profit and loss, reflect financial income and expense eq- 
equity method, gain and loss, other non-operating income and expense, corporate income tax, and income and loss from discontinued operations, 
we posted ¥516.5 billion in net income. 
Next on cash flow. 
Cash flow from operating activities of the third quarter was ¥568.1 billion and 
cash from investment activities was negative ¥907.3 billion. 
As a result net cash flow amounted to negative ¥185.5 billion. And when we're collecting cash from financial activities of ¥630.3 billion, net 
changing cash increased by ¥444.8 billion from the previous quarter. 
After referral reflecting changes in cash classify that help ourselves of negative ¥11.3 billion, cash 
balance at the end of the third quarter came to stand at ¥6.6 trillion. 
Next is the key financial position and indicators for the third quarter of 2021. 
As of the end of the third quarter, our assets did at ¥54.6 trillion, liability at ¥34.3 trillion, and equity at ¥20.3 trillion, all 
leverage ratios, liability to equity, debt to equity, and net to equity decreased quarter on quarter and year on year, continuing to maintain a healthy financial condition. 
Next is the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
In terms of the macro environment, recovery is the real economy is expected on the back of COVID-19 destinations and the plan to coexist with the coronavirus. 
But there are also uncertainty standing from raw material and component price hikes, monetary policy normalization, and the threat of global inflation. 
Amid this environment, we'll focus on expanding sales of premium products through differentiated marketing activities 
and response relentively to market volatility by continuously improving cost structures and proactively managing risk. 
We expect our fourth quarter revenue to grow quarter on quarter and year on year 
with increased sales of premium appliances and TVs and recovery in the B2B business. 
In terms of profitability, there are risks regarding raw material and low logistics cost, but we will secure a stable profitability through better product mix and efficient spending. 
Now let's move on to the third quarter results and outlook by business. First is HNA. 
Lemme share the third quarter results of HNA. 
Sales stood at ¥7.1 trillion with a 15% increase year on year, driven by growth in overseas markets, such as North America, Europe and Latin America. 
Despite the upside of revenue growth and marketing cost savings, 
operating profit decreased year on year due to increased raw material prices and logistics and labor cost hikes. 
Next is the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
The growth and global demand is projected to slow down, but the situation is expected to unfold differently for region and segment 
the burden from raw material price hikes and increased logistics costs are expected to persist. 
Amidst this environment, we will actively enhance sales efforts armed with our strong product competitiveness to maintain a double digit growth in revenue 
and also increase selling price and optimized cost to maintain stable profitability. 
I will share the third quarter results of HE. 
Sales grew year on year, thanks to robust product sales of Oola TVs on the back of rising demand for premium products. 
We maintained sound profitability by offsetting the high LCD TV panel price burden with effects from increased Oola TV sales and efficient resource management. 
Now let me share the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
In the market, local TV demand is projected to decrease slightly year on year as people spend less time at home 
with the progress in COVID 19 vaccination. 
We expect marketing spending to increase to respond to the intensifying competition in the TV market, 
but we will maintain revenue growth and secure solid profitability by improving product mix with a focus on premium products. 
Let me share the third quarter results of ES. 
Despite the decrease of vehicle production in the market due to the supply shortage of automotive semiconductors, sales 
grew year on year, thanks to increased volume on new projects and revenue growth of electric vehicle components. 
Profitability showed that temporary decrease as the provision for GM Bolt Recalls was reflected. 
For the fourth quarter outlet with the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, 
the supply shortage of auto semiconductors is expected to persist leading to a consequence shutdowns of major or implants. 
This in turn may lead to a decreasing demand for vehicle components. 
We expect the continuous supply issue of automotive semiconductors and subsequent risk of disruption in auto production to have an impact on profitability, lowering the probability of achieving the turnaround in the fourth quarter. 
I will share that third quarter results of BS. 
Sales grew 14%, year on year on the back of expanded sales of information display products with the recovery in the B2B market 
and found revenue growth in IT business. 
Operating profit declined year on year due to rising prices of major components, such as LCD panels and wavers, 
and the impact from increased global logistics costs. 
Now the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
There are both opportunities and risks in the market demand for IT products, including gaming monitors is expected to remain strong in line with non-face to face trends. 
And the B2B market is projected to show a gradual recovery in demand, 
but there may be impact from semiconductor shortage and increased prices of major components like LCD panels. 
Amidst this environment, 
we expect sales to grow quarter on quarter and year on year with the seasonality effect in IT business and the recovering demand in the B2B market. 
The improvements in profitability are presented to be limited due to the continuing cost increase and intensifying competition. 
We seek to secure momentum in enhancing profitability by improving product mix and strengthening cost competitiveness. 
That brings us to the end of the third quarter earnings release and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
We will now take questions. Operator, please commence with the Q 
and A session. Foreign Language 
Now, Q and A 
will begin, please press star and one, if you have any questions. 
Questions will be taken according to the order you have pressed star and number one. For cancellation, please press star and two on your phone. 
Foreign Language. 
The first question will be presented by from Toongon Gee from KV Securities. Please go ahead with our question. Foreign Language. 
I'd like to post two questions on HNA 
first with, uh, spike in largest cost, I'm wondering about the impact on the preferability level of aging and company. 
And also I'm wondering what will be your corporate strategy in response to the logistic disr- disruption that is appearing recently. 
My second question is related to HNA as well. Um, um, 
I'd like to understand the proportion of new appliance sales 
and it's trend. And can you forecast, uh, new appliances business down the road by region, by region? 
Foreign Language. Uh, the question on HNA, uh, it was about our corporate response and strategy with respect to logistics, disruption. 
As you know, the, uh, air and sea transportation costs are heating a record high every day. 
And that is tempering the profitability of HNA company. Foreign Language. 
According to many research firm, it is forecast 
that the phenomenon will persist until the first half and 
even up until the second half of next year. And some predict that it will take another one to two years more. 
Foreign Language. Uh, it's the look at, is impact on our top line revenue, it, it is decreasing our top line revenue by 2% on year on year basis. 
And in line with this, we are trying to deploy more extra ships in collaboration with global shipping companies. 
So, so that we can minimize its impact on our supply site. 
Also, we are trying to curve the, uh, spike of by logisticals by optimizing our global supply chain. 
Foreign Language. In 2022, as well, based on a flawless supply chain and logistic network, we're going to make tiny decisions and take 
them into action with speed so that we can minimize the risk on 
our, uh, supply side. 
Foreign 
Language. 
Further more based on a solid partnership with our partnership in 
companies, we are working on the 
negotiation to create a win-win operation for both of us, and also by leveraging the STN 
capability and logistic c- competitiveness that we have built this far, 
we are going to put the first priority in meeting our delivery commitment, we are, with our customers. 
We will strive to, continue to become, uh, the leader in the market. 
Foreign Language. So let me take your question on the, uh, the proportion of new appliance sales. 
I will say that the sales of new appliance has been recording a two-digit level growth every year. 
So we are seeing the rise of the proportion from 14% in 2018 to around 17 to 18% in 2021. 
So I will say that the proportion of new appliances still is increasing within HNA company. Foreign Language. Amid, uh, the 
COVID-19 pandemic combined with the trend of data state 
inaudible activities now, nowadays consumers have easier access to product information. 
And, uh, the hygiene and healthcare functions of our home appliances have become a critical component or part of their decision making. 
Foreign 
Language. 
If you look at the pattern of this, uh, sales by region, 
we see that this pattern is more pronounced in the advance market, North America and 
Europe, and as the- inaudible market, North America and Europe, and as the theme is deeply associated with hygiene and healthcare, 
we believe that we were able to record a high growth with our steam function home appliance such as styler dryer- dryers and dishwashers. 
foreign language 
In the emerging market, on the other hand, we see the demand for those products to continue to go up. 
We are trying to make those products which have hygienic and healthcare functions as extension products for consumers, 
by offering those products at a more affordable price range to increase of our sales furthermore. 
So also for the consumers' awareness we are trying to leverage the successful cases in the Korean market, 
so- for this then we are continuing our investment in the brand, and we will try to enhance the brand 
positioning in the market 
through these efforts. 
foreign language Next question please. foreign language inaudible 
The next question will be presented by inaudible from inaudible Securities. 
Please go ahead with your question. 
foreign language 



Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. My first question is about the power crisis in China. 
Did power shortage in China cause any damage in divisions of LGE, and if any, how much is the damage? 
My second question is for HE. 
Samsung Electronics officially adopted QD- OLED TVs as the next years TV line-up. What's your position about this move? 
And what impact do you think it will have on LGE's W OLED TV business, and what will be the competition landscape going forward? 
foreign language 

Answering your question on power shortage in China, and it's impact on production subsidiaries in China; 
we received a request to reduce daytime power usage in some locations, 
including HE divisions, production subsidiary in inaudible Province from mid-September. 
foreign 
language We are responding by 
converting daytime production to the nighttime without significant disruption. 
Moreover, in preparation of any worse situation, we added 
self generation facilities, and are controlling use of power for non-production purpose, based on our emergency response plan. 
Foreign language In addition, in close consultation with local governments and energy authorities, 
we have secured an information sharing system, to know power-control plans in advance, 
and we are constantly monitoring any change in power supply status based on the preempted response system. 
foreign language Uh, um, regarding the 
question about the HE, 
the question was about the launch of a QD OLED TV, uh, next year by Samsung Electronics and the competition outlook. 
And there are of course concerns about the next product launch, with the adoption of QD OLED by the competitor, uh, especially about 
the intense competition. 
foreign language 
However, we think here is a positive aspect because we can extend the OLED ecosystem.inaudible 
foreign 
language 
So as our response strategy, we want to solidify our image as a- as a leader in OLED 
TV that we have built for the past 10 years. 
And also, so we will lead the OLED technology, 
so that the customers can experience as intrinsic values such as a picture quality and fun factors. foreign language 
And we will continue to maximize our capability as a top OLED TV manufacturer by 
s- strengthening the- the premium 
line-up, and, uh, meeting the customer needs, so 
that, uh, we think we will be able to 
continue to lead the market. foreign language Next question please? foreign language 
The next question will be presented by inaudible phonetic -Kim from Kim Securities. Please go ahead with your question. 
foreign 
language I'd like to pose two questions, my first question is on phonetic VS. Um, 
I'm wondering about the impact of the short supply of auto-motives semiconductor, uh, especially it's impact on your performance. 
If you think the impact was not big, I'd like to understand the reason why. My second question is on VS. 
Recently we see there is a fierce competition in the solar module industry due to the emergence of the 
Chinese makers, so I'd like to understand your corporate strategy to enhance your profitability. 
foreign language 
We believe that the risk of the shortage of automotive semiconductor is not a temporary phenomenon, 
but is likely to persist for quite some time. foreign language 
In particular, 
due to the supply chain issue 
in South East Asia, brought on by the resurgence of Covid-19, the shortage rather deteriorated in the third quarter, 
and as it is forecast to drag on further into the fourth quarter, 
we are keeping a close eye on the market 
situation. 
foreign language Also we received some impact due to the shut-down measures of inaudible suppliers, and increase of automotive component prices, 
however, we collaborated with suppliers inaudible and we also pulled in some of the automotive 
semiconductors, inaudible and also applied dual sourcing in order to minimize it's impact on our inaudible. foreign 
language foreign language Let 
me 
take 
your question on solar business. This year, the price of poly silicon on top of the value chain for solar module business has increased by four-fold on a year on year basis. 
With a spike on raw material prices the cost level deteriorated, which hampered the profitability of most of the module makers. 
foreign language As you 
know, we've been running our business centering around high-output, high-efficient products. 
We will be leveraging our LG brand and global sales capability. 
Also through our development capability for high-efficiency, high-output products, we 
will continue to extend sales opportunities in the residential market and inaudible countries showing a clear preference for high-output products. 
At the same time we will strive to raise profitability by improving cost level and output of our products. foreign language We'll move onto the next question, please. foreign language 
The next question will be presented by phonetic S K Kim from inaudible -Market. Please go ahead with your question. 
foreign 
language 



Thank you for the opportunity to speak. 
I have two questions and they both goes to the VS division. 
And the first one is about the VS's, uh, automotive electronics business. 
The market expectations have seen the high about the automotive electronics business of the VS, 
however, the raw material costs are increasing and there- there has been the shortage of semiconductors, 
the worsening the outlook for the performance VS division. 
And the semiconductor issue will continue, and, uh, will continue until the fourth quarter, 
and so- so, uh, raising the concern about the turnaround target of the VS. 
So what's your outlook for the performance and what's your opinion about the current situation? 
My second question is about the- the provision for the recall cost. 
According to the disclosure, the provision has been set aside for the recall cost, however 
the provision amount, uh, seems greater than the actual need. 
And so, is there a possibility that you will reverse the provision 
later? foreign language To answer either of your questions about the, uh, business outlook, then the production of the OEM as a complete car is expected to decline by 10%. 
foreign language We have been responding to the situation, 
however it was an 
unavoidable situation because, uh, it was the- the impact on the production disruption at the top tier inaudible and the OEM side. 
foreign language 
In regards to a- the profit turnaround of the VS business next year, 
the risk of automotive component inaudible reduction is expected to continue until the first quarter of the next year, or even the second quarter of next year. foreign language 
The fluidity still remain in the global automotive market 
but we will minimize sales disruption through close co-operation with OEM, and the diversified supply chain. 
Moreover, in terms of profitability, we will make concerted efforts to achieve meaningful outcome in 2022, 
by focusing on improving the profit and loss structure through continued cost saving activities. 
foreign language I'm sorry, your other question on the possibility of, uh, the recall, the provision, the reversal? 
foreign language Uh, he asked, is the plan to recall about 140 thous-… it's planned to recall about 140,000 both inaudible manufacturers and sold from 2016 to the first half of 2021. 
Foreign language. 
The total amount of provision was calculated using the most reasonable estimation 
based on the recall method agreed between the three companies and what has been identified so far. Foreign language. 
In addition, LGE and LG Chem evenly split the recall cost to book the provisioned expenses 
and the final cost sharing ratio will be later decided depending of the liabilities of LTE and LG Chem. Foreign language. 
Therefore, please understand that it's difficult to tell you about the possibility of the reversal of the preset provisions just based on the assumption. Foreign language. Foreign language. We will take the next question please. Foreign language. 
The next question will be presented by inaudible from TD Financial Investments. 
Please go ahead with your question. 
Foreign language. I have two questions. Both, uh, questions are 
on 
HE. First, uh, 

this year, you've recorded such a solid performance with your TV products. 
I think that with this performance, you'll be able to achieve four million units of sales this year. 
Now I'm wondering how you forecast this year, 2021, and next year in terms of the sales of over TV. 
If you meet the target of sales, I'm wondering what will be the proportion of all the TV sales out of the total TVs revenue. 
My second question is also on HE. Uh, we see, uh, the price level of LC TVs is going down very regularly. 
I think, uh, compared to all the 
TV, uh, with this price decrease, uh, the LC TV will be able to recover its price competitiveness in the market. So 
I'm wondering about the impact of this trend on the sales and profitability of your OLED business. 
So can you share your, uh, corporate opinion on this? 
Foreign language. So let 

me take your first question on AT, in particular regarding the forecast of OLED TV sales. 
So looking at the performance of OLED TV sales, um, in the third quarter of this year, we don't… we are meeting the plan for OLED TV sales 100%. 
Foreign language. 
However, looking into the fourth quarter there is a concern or the risk of the slowdown of TV demand globally because of the uncertainty in the global economy and extension of 
living with, uh, 
COVID-19 inaudible. Foreign language. 
However, we think that, uh, there will be no difficulty 
in achieving our target of meeting four million units of sales that we set out early this year, which is the double the target of the previous year. 
Foreign language. 

If this is the case, we forecast the proportion of OLED TV sales to be around 32%, showing 24% of growth on a year-on-year basis. 
Foreign language. 
Regarding the target for the next year with our OLED TVs, 
we haven't finalized our, our target yet and we are working on the planning and simulation to set up the target for the next year. 
Foreign 
language. 
However, uh, if we do a close analysis on the TV market trends, uh, both for TV sets and panels and consumer needs, 
uh, we forecast that the demand for premium product will continue to go up. 
So in line with this, we are going to continue to increase the proportion of our online OLED TV sales inaudible. Foreign language. 
Now 
I'll take your second question. It was on 
the impact of decreased of LCD TV prices on the profitability and top line revenue of OLED TVs. 
Foreign 
language. 
Based on our understanding on the market dynamics, uh, we understand that the competitor has given a price discount mainly to the new OLED TV inaudible space. 
Foreign 
language. 
However, looking at various external factors such as the LCD supply, LCD panel supply led by the Chinese panel makers, 
a short supply of semiconductor components 
and increase in logistics costs, we believe that it won't be easy to give that much price discount to the LCD TV. 
Foreign 
language. 
Given that, 
um, there will be some impact on the demand of OLED TV because of this limited price discount of LCD TVs. 
However, we can make use of this trend of increasing demand for premium product, especially on OLED TVs. 
And the strength of the OLED TV… A strength that OLED TV can bring about. 
I believe that we will be able to maintain, uh, the solid 
top line revenue and profitability for the next year. Foreign language. Next question, please. <unk>. 
The next question will be presented by Nikola Gudua from Uveus. Please go ahead with your question. 
Yes, uh. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Um, going back to uh, uh, 
semi supply constraints, you talked about automotive, but what has been, uh, the, uh, overall impact across all of your business 
and how are you managing this? Has it gotten better 
or worse a- as well, uh, for the course of 2021? 
Um, and what has been the impact on, uh, revenues and margins. So that's both profits and margins, yeah. Not just, uh, revenues. 
Um, and secondly, uh, on the plans, uh, uh, you also talked about the impact of logistic costs going up, 
um, but what has been the impact on… of material price increases on appliances margins in, uh, the last quarter, in Q3 ' 21? 
And what could we expect to see, uh, going forward? Thank you. 
Foreign language. 
Foreign language. Uh, regarding the semiconductor shortage issue, my answer can be divided into the TV business and the automotive component business. 
Foreign language. I think these questions, uh, raise the concerns 
mainly about the automotive semiconductor shortage, 
the inaudible sourcing for semiconductors, uh, required for our products. We don't have significant issues, except for some impact on the price increase. 
However, uh, as other tier one vendors, uh, for 
for menin- uh, semiconductor shortage and problems in supplying components, it uh, has resulted in intermittent production disruptions in major OEMs. 
Foreign 
language. 
As for the impact on our performance, 
we have been affected to some degree by the supply disruption of a OEM because this… our, uh, demand 
o- on our side has decreased. And also, so there have been some price hikes of the components. 
Um, however, our diversified supply chain management system enables us to fulfill customer orders on time. 
So therefore, so once this issue is resolved, 
because we are ready to fulfill customers orders in a, 
um, prompt manner, we anticipate that we can achieve more meaningful growth down the road. 
Foreign 
language. 
As for the inaudible business, as a market leader in the industry, 
so we have a procuring power and a deep, uh, trust and partnership with suppliers. 
So with that, so we have seen the managing and appropriate level of a inventory and, uh, 
by doing so, we have a minimized, uh, impact on our business by the securing the DDIC and SOC 
and other components. 
Foreign language. As for the, uh, raw material cost and as the impact on the <unk>, uh, business in 2021, 
we will say that the impact on 
our annual sales for 
this year, uh, will be 2.5% to 3% and this estimations that include the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
Foreign 
language. inaudible such as steel, inaudible and, uh, copper, so have seen a price increase on 
every quarter and that this trend will continue even in the fourth quarter. 
So for HNA 
as a business, it is, uh, certain it's a factor that's worsening our profitability outlook. 
Foreign language. 
Again, in 2021, 
uh, raw material supply and demand imbalance will continue 
and also, we expect that especially the steel price will increase steeply. 
Foreign language. 


Under these circumstances, along with globally integrated negotiations, 
we are minimizing need for raising product prices by the fostering the key makers in each region, adopting diversified sourcing and the optimized SCN and the other, many others, 
uh, 
activities. 
Foreign language. 
In addition, as the better economic factors and external factors, especially China, that have suddenly increased, 
we are focusing our organizational capabilities on proactively responding to current price hikes and offsetting this from unstable supply 
through timely inter- Setting this 
from unstable supply through timely inter-visional resourcing and 

the price for testing.Next question, please. foreign language The next question will be presented by inaudible from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. foreign language So, 


I'd like to pose two questions. My first question is on, uh, HNANHE. Um, 
if you look at the operating inaudible at a quarterly basis, 
you used to show a great fluctuation for many many years so far in terms of TV and home inaudible businesses. 
However, looking at the fourth quarter, the performance of the fourth quarter is decreasing more slowly than what has been happening in the past. 
Can you explain the reason why this phenomenon? 
And also, I'm wondering if there would be any risk of showing a high performance, solid performance in the first half 
and then showing a decrease of the performance in second half, once again, like the past? 
Or you have already established a stable business model 
with TV and inaudible products showing even performances between first half and the latter half? 
And my second question is on inaudible. 
Recently, many agencies or governments are announcing their ESG or emissions related policies. 
As you have already explained about your solar business, 
I'm wondering and I'd like to understand the overall progress of your 
renewable business related strategy and ongoing project in line with this trend? 
If 


you look at the 
trend for the past four years, including 2021, especially looking at the two year 2018 and 2019, 
the profitability ratio was around 73 between first half and the second half. 
inaudible you're gonna find the pent up 
inaudible caused by the COVID-19 for the past two years, recent two years, 2020 and ' 
21, the performance was around 64 first half and second half. 
So, we are seeing a gradual improvement of profitability in the second half. 




As you are already aware, 
most of the promotional seasons, including the United States, are concentrated in the second half or, in particular, fourth 
quarter which is driving up all of the inaudible of that period. 
And also we are impacted by the seasonality related to the AC business. 
So, that's the reason why we have the structure of showing a lower profitability in the second half compared to that of the first half. 
Uh, 
of course there were some impacts coming from the pent up demand in improving our performance for the second half for the last two years, 
however we internally made continuous efforts to improve the profitability in the second half 
and also we strive to execute our expenses in a more efficient manner. 
So, as of yet we couldn't overcome this pattern of showing a lower performance in the second half, fully. 
However, compared to the past we were able to make gradual, small but important improvements, showing better performance in the second half. 
So, uh, with this gradual improvements, I believe that this pattern of showing a lower profitability in the second half will continue to persist for the time being. 
Let 
me take your question 
regarding new renewable energy. 
As ESG grows in importance, major countries are spending their green policies to tackle climate change. 
In light with this trend, the demand for new renewable energy is forecasted to grow continuously? 
Regarding your question about the progress of new projects, please understand that it is difficult to share specifics. 
But I like to say that we are keeping a close watch on additional business opportunities arising in the energy business ecosystem. 
So, for example, we're reviewing a solution as to how we can offer an optimized solution for efficient power consumption at home. 
Next question, please. 
Currently, 
there are no participants with questions. Please press star 1, star and 1 to give your question. 
The next question will be presented by inaudible from Bank of America. 
Please 
go 
ahead with your question. foreign language I have one question about the VS, 
uh, business. That when we look at 
inaudible 
quarterly, 
the sales 
of performance of the VS that it's 
hovering around or under 2 trillion wan. 
And the VS division explained that many of the reasons including the component inaudible and the disruption of the customer side. 
inaudible, can you, again, provide a high level overview about your business situation? 
And in regards to the inaudible backlog, as of October, is it about 60 trillion wan? 
And when can you, sir, make, uh, the turnaround in inaudible over 2 trillion wan and the even 3 trillion wan in the sales. So, I'm wondering so when will be the inflection point of a inaudible 
and can we expect that it's going to be the third quarter 2022? 
And also, the inaudible backlog is 60 trillion wan 
so what is the portion of our inaudible related component business? 
So, answering your questions on the order backlog. So, as we communicated 
the order backlog of 2021 is over 6 trillion wan 
and is continuously rising. 
And if you look at the proportions 
out of the older backlogs, the infotainment
