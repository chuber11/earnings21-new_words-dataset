Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
Welcome to our conference call for the full year of 2020 results. 
We really appreciate your participation in this call. 
inaudible for business information due to prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, Telkom has successfully managed business and financial performance. 
We recorded 136.5 trillion in consolidated revenue, increased 0.7% from previous year. 
Our EBITDA grew by 11.2% with an EBITDA margin increase from 47.8% to 52.8%, 
while at the bottom line, net income increased by 11.5% 
to 
IDR20 .8 trillion, with a better net income margin at 15.2% from 13.8% last year. 
IndiHome continues to become the engine of growth, as it contributed IDR22 .2 trillion, grew by 21.2% with 
contribution to consolidated revenue increase to 16% from 14% last year. 
Our EBITDA margin of IndiHome reached 38.9%, a significant increase from 33.9% last year. 
The IndiHome revenue growth was a result of increasing subscribers coupled with improving ARPU. 
Total subscribers grew by 14.5% to reach 8 million, while ARPU in first quarter improved to 
262,000, compared to 253,000 in the previous quarter. 
Increasing ARPU was largely driven by revenue from adds-on that grew by 27.8% and contributed to around 14.7% to IndiHome revenue, 
compared to 13.6% in the same period last year. 
inaudible From the enterprise segment, although it declined by 5.2% year-on-year, it saw 
significant improvement during the year, which was mainly due to the success of the new strategy to reduce low margin business and focus on more profitable products, along with various effort to get quality revenues. 
inaudible will continue to strengthen the fundamentals with focus on core activity, data center, and cloud and application services 
that blended into various enterprise solutions. 
With proper solid fundamentals, we expect the price segment to become our next engine of growth in the foreseeable future. 
Ladies and gentlemen, in the year of 2020, wholesale and international business segments successfully performed, 
with revenue grew by 27.3% year- on-year to IDR13 .5 trillion. 
The growth was basically generated from domestic business such as 
power business due to inorganic activities and increasing aid to the SMS due to the pandemic, 
while the international business also have some good performance driven by overseas growth 
in voice, data 
service, and data business. Data, data center contributes to a promising growth for both domestic and international market. 
inaudible Our mobile business still face intense competition and continued declining legacy due to transition from voice and SMS to data. 
As a result, the company revenue declined by 4.4% year-on-year, mainly driven by some decrease in voice and SMS. 
On the other hand, retail business revenue increased by 7% to 62.3 trillion and significantly increased its contribution to 71.6% of reconciled revenues, compared to 63.9% last year. 
Digital business revenue growth was driven data traffic that increased by 43.8%. 
The company will continue to focus on providing the best customer experience rather than promoting unreasonable pricing to support industry readiness. 
Therefore, we keep enhancing our network by adding 27.7 thousand for the ID devices during the year. 
We recently come up in 20 megahertz spectrum in 2.3 gigahertz that strengthen our spectrum within position including who asked 
to prepare 5G technology. 
In parallel, we also try to find strategic partnership or collaboration with digital player inaudible to help accelerate digital transformation. 
Already, five business has helped us run the company suddenly when one segment is missing before this, the times. 
The still performance of fixed line business has successfully compensate our mobile business that was pressured by competition and legacy decline. 
In the past five years, we have seen revenue portion from fixed business increase from 28% to 39%, 
while its net income contribution significantly increased from around 5% to 22% in 2020. 
Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude my remarks, let me share our spend guidance for the year of 2021. 
One, we expect consolidated revenue to grow by around mid-single digit. 
Two, EBITDA margin is expected to be relatively stable. 
Three, capital expenditure for the group is expected at around 25% of revenues. 
That's the end of my remarks. Thank you. 
Thank you, Ririek. We will now begin the Q&A session. When reading your question, please state clearly your name and your company. 
Operator, may we have the first question, please? Thank you. 
Just a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound or hash key. 
Your first question is from Piyush Choudhary of HSBC. Please, ask your question. 
Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Uh, thanks for the call and congrats for the results. Two questions. 
Firstly, on mobile, can you talk about the competitive dynamics in the industry and outlook for 2021? 
And has Telkomsel achieved the desired objective after the rollout of unlimited plans last year? 
Secondly, um, as you mentioned that you have acquired 20 megahertz in 2.3, can you share the likely network rollout plans? 
And when do you intend to start offering 5G services using 2.3? Thank you. Hi, Piyush, Rachel here, here. Um, 
I'll address your question on, uh, competition landscape. 
So, as, uh, you pointed out, the last six months for 2020 
our product and pricing strategy were inaudible, uh, corrections needed to put discipline into the type of industry pricing practices back then. 
It was necessary for Telkom to protect our relative market position. 
And so now, we have achieved those objectives in those six to nine months of strategy. 
However, as the market leader, we need to always stay focused on driving sustainable growth behaviors in the industry. 
Telkomsel has already initiated price adjustments 
on the back of macroeconomic recovery. We see the process of fiscal stimulation, we see businesses and individuals adapting much better to COVID-19 
with the COVID rollout. All this, uh, inaudible of the prospect of the pace of economic activity, and we see this as a positive outlook. 
And with this positive outlook, 
in our consideration, we felt the timing was right for us to review our product and pricing away from unlimited, introducing more focus on, uh, BTL simple and easy to understand offers for existing customers, 
and also introducing more affordable packages in the form of, uh, more affordable lower denominations in the areas of acquisitions. 
However, Telkomsel will continue to monitor closely the behaviors of other operators to avoid and prevent price wars, 
and to have optimum premium gaps, uh, while protecting, uh, rela- relative market positions. 
I think moving forward, uh, looking at, uh, the other players in the market, 
we foresee, uh, healthy upward new recoveries and grow positively. I think overall, the industry is much more rational now, 
and let's strive to watch the sustainable growth as a whole industry. I hope that answers. I hope that answered. Yes. <crosstalk> Yeah. Yeah. 
This is Setyanto from Telkomsel. Uh, regarding your question about, uh, network rollout plan with regard to the 2300, 
uh, megahertz that we won from the auction, 
uh, few weeks ago. 
So, uh, by having this, uh, additional 20 megahertz in 2300; now Telkomsel holding 50 megahertz in 2300, 
and it will strengthen, uh, our network position in the market. 
Uh, so we will use it, uh, both for, uh, strengthening our 4G leadership 
and also, uh, preparing for, uh, 5G implementation in Indonesia, 
uh, as soon as possible. 
So, as a company, uh, as a leading digital company, we want to be, uh, remain as the leader in the technology. 
So, uh, we will use, uh, maximize the usage of this new spectrum to strengthen both 4G and 5G. 
Sure. But is there any timeline when you're looking to launch 5G services? 
Uh, we will launch it, uh, this year. 
Uh, we have some plan. Uh, I cannot, uh, reveal it, uh, exactly now, but, uh, in upcoming, uh, 
few months, you will see the, the, the launch of the 5G. Okay. 
Thanks a lot. Uh, I'll come back in the 
queue. The next question comes from the line of Arthur Pineda from Citigroup. Please ask your question. 
Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Uh, two questions, please. 
Uh, first, can we get a better understanding of the growth of Telkomsel into the fourth quarter? 
Um, you've posted a 4% Q-on-Q growth for Telkomsel as a group. But when you break down voice, that was down, and data was down Q-on-Q. 
So it could mean that other revenues are driving this. So, what is exactly classified on, on this side? 
Uh, second question I had is with regard to the outlook for 2021. 
Are you able to flesh out your mid-single-digit growth guidance across the business lines between fixed, mobile, and enterprise? Thank you. 
Okay, Arthur, uh, Heri speaking here. Let me try to answer your second question. 
On the guideline for 2021, 
uh, basically we have, uh, diversified our portfolio, of course, uh, from, uh, in the home going to continue to grow. 
And I think in the enterprise, uh, with regard to current COVID situation today, 
uh, which we don't uh, really know, uh, where it's going to be benign. 
I think that, uh, uh, provide us with, uh, let's say vertical digit growth. 
But, uh, our focus is to have, uh, more quality, I think, 
uh, in terms of the, uh, portfolio, uh, customer portfolio and also, uh, profitability in this, uh, area. 
And then, uh, in the 
cellular, uh, we see there's build-up, I think, uh, pressure in the industry, until the conciliation, uh, really happen. 
So we put it more, I think, uh, uh, conservative because this industry is also going to be providing, uh, 
low-single-digit growth in the mobile, uh, as well. 
So, while having that uh, combination, 
I think we, uh, come to the, uh, overall as, uh, my CEO 
previously mentioned, that, uh, we're going to have a low to mid-single digit, uh, growth in the revenue, uh, overall in our company. 
That's, uh, I think a brief, uh, 
explanation to the, your second question. Yes. So from, from number, uh, number one question, actually, the, the impact for, uh, 
Q4 actually coming from the implementation of the PSAK, uh, 72, which is related with IFRS 
15. So, we, we're doing the analyze with, uh, regard to delegated revenue on queue. 
If we have the similar comparison, it will be, supposed to be, uh, this is based on the, you know, the, the last, 
uh, uh, accounting report. It's going to be normalized 5.6. 
And then, if, if we look at the digital revenue, if it is also normalized, 
uh, it's gonna be, uh, increased by 7.3 in- instead of decreasing 7.1 related with the, 
the digital business revenue. Thank you. 
Okay. So, so, the, the difference is mainly because of accounting changes- Yeah. not, not because of value-added services being, being booked? 
So, actually because the, under the IFRS, uh, 
15, we have to, uh, request related with the discount, we said. So, in, in, in the last, uh, 
uh, quarter four, we did the, you know, the reclassification and proportionate allocate for the legacy revenue and digital business revenue. 
Thank you. Got it, thank you. 
Your next question comes from the line of Xian Chen Fong of CIMB. Please ask your question. 
Hi, thanks for the call. This is, uh, Fong from CIMB. 
Uh, three questions from me. Firstly, uh, on IndiHome, can you talk a bit about competition, uh, in this space? 
And, uh, do you see that as potentially, uh, you know, uh, posing some risks to your ARPU 
and also your subscriber targets for 2021? Uh, that's the first question. 
Secondly, for, uh, the enterprise business, 
um, you mentioned, uh, there are still some uncertainties with regards to, uh, the impact on COVID-19 and all that. 
Uh, but I wanted to find out, uh, you know, do you expect the enterprise business to be still loss making, uh, this year or do you see a turnaround? 
And my third question, uh, with regards to Telkomsel, um, how do you see opex trending this year, uh, excluding depreciation? Yeah, those are my three questions. Thank you. 
Okay. Uh, thank you, uh, Mr. Fong. Uh, et me start to answer your question on the IndiHome competitive, uh, 
landscape. Uh, today, uh, even in the, 
I think, uh, the same footprint that we have with our competitor, we don't see kind of a very aggressive, uh, movement from our, uh, competitors. 
So, the competition quite profitable for us, as we have, I think, uh, end- to-end, uh, the fiber that are much stronger compared to our competitors. 
Uh, on the other hand, with regard to this, actually, uh, regarding the, 
I think, uh, 
ARPU correction, we don't see that, uh, in this, uh, moment because as the digital recession coming, uh, with the, I think, uh, higher speed right now, 
and also, uh, more people work from home and, uh, study from home, 
the demand becoming, uh, actually, uh, stronger. And then, uh, many actually our customer asking for, uh, higher speed of the IndiHome services. 
This, uh, in addition to some of the, I think, content that we provide also in the, in the home, 
uh, will, uh, give us a kind of a profitable situation in terms of the, uh, ARPU, uh, uh, trend in this year. 
Okay. Uh, and, and then, uh, in the second question, under enterprise, uh, impact of this COVID, 
as we, uh, mentioned to you that, uh, 
actually, uh, we're becoming more, uh, I think, uh, selective in choosing the project, 
and to seeing our clients and also, uh, more seeing the profitability also of the business. 
So, uh, we say that actually this business, uh, although still quite low in terms of the profitability, 
it is already provide a profitability business for us. 
What we do expect, as mentioned also by, uh, our CEO, 
this is going to be our content of our future business. 
As we improve the, I 
think, uh, profitability, and as I think, uh, more enterprise need services from this one, uh, we believe this will going to be next to the, uh, IndiHome growth in the future. 
Number three, uh, sorry? Okay. 
So, just with the company costs trending for this year, 
for, for 2020, we see, you know, slightly decreased, uh, combination between opex and depreciation. 
And for this year, 2021, the opex related with the revenue and some costs related with 
the, you know, spectrum that we get, it's going to be, uh, 
uh, invest, and it's going to be aligned with 
the, you know, additional, uh, investment that'll assist with our, uh, costs in the, the, the, you know, the, the, the network and also the power. 
So, it means the trending for opex, 
the some cost related with revenue is going to be increased a little bit with the additional of our, uh, you know, network. 
But some cost related with the, uh, digitalization related with how we, we end up with the impact of the profit is going to be, uh, decreasing. 
So, we also do the, you know, the monitoring of the cost related with our network because 
currently, we have the program to, you know, to simplify our network based on settings, our 3G. So perhaps with those kind of, you know, activity, the opex, 
the relative of the network can be managed. 
And we have also scaling out in some of the network capacity. 
Uh, and then, we, we, we also have the benefit of the, you know, from the inaudible work that we are, uh, not currently, uh, selling the power 
because the, the inaudible have the 
slightly, uh, you know, bet- better compared with the market. 
So it means the cost, uh, still, uh, can be manageable, 
and if it is, uh, in place, it's going to be aligned with our, uh, revenue and our, uh, uh, network 
value. And this is, thank you so much, everyone. 
Next question comes from the line of Krishna Kutabara of Mandeeri. Please ask your question. 
Hi. Good afternoon, uh, management. Uh, thanks for the opportunity. I have two questions, actually, um, so just bear with me. Uh, my first question is, uh, a bit on Telkomsel. 
Uh, can we get some update on Telkomsel's capital allocation strategy over the next two to three years? 
Uh, we can see that Telkomsel has monetized its brick and mortar assets, such as towers, 
and at the same time, invested more heavily into tech platforms such as investments in inaudible NTMI, and so on. 
So, as Telkomsel, uh, recalibrates its asset structure, uh, can we get some color up to how much of Telkomsel's business will actually be the, towards the digital mobile? 
And perhaps any guidance from the little capex budget for the next two to three years? And what sort of ROIC and enterprise solution impact that, uh, Telkomsel seeks to 
achieve? Uh, second question is to Telkom management as well, uh, similar to the question to Telkomsel. Uh, 
when it comes to digital investments, uh, we understand that some of these investments, uh, may not yield as high cash returns as traditional telecom businesses in the near-term. So-… returns at traditional car companies in the near term. 
So, how should we balance the need to maintain, uh, steady cash returns at dot com levels with the need to fulfill, uh, inaudible video inaudible strategy and negotiate moving forward? 
G- g- good question, thank you. 
Okay. Um… Okay. So, I think from the capital, we, 
we, uh, we have the plan to, you know, to maintain 
the percentage of our, uh, revenue is gonna be around 14% to 15%, aligned with, uh, you know, the percentage of our, 
uh, you know, our, our revenues. 
So this means the capital is gonna be, uh, slightly, uh, aligned with our, our, 
uh, slightly, uh, good, uh, our inaudible aligned with our, uh, revenue contribution, 
and, uh, treating, uh, from the next two and three years. 
And then it inaudible digital, uh, investment, I think, uh, ba- inaudible for this, uh, you know, aspect, uh, the equation, please. 
Yeah, uh, thank you very much, uh, for the question. And clearly, I think, 
uh, we continue to look for good and strategic opportunity to invest in, 
uh, uh, growth potential. And I think you highlighted about, uh, our investment in inaudible. 
Uh, yes, uh, we have done our first investment, 
um, and 
so, if I may, you know, it, it has been a good uh, opportunity for us, 
and in the early days, we have seen good traction, uh, among the two companies, we see synergy that we can derive. 
So moving forward, you know, uh, if we continue to have opportunities like that, 
uh, we will, we will definitely uh, uh, look at the investments, uh, carefully. 
Uh, at the same time, uh, beyond the inorganic, uh, we also actively looking, uh, at organic growth, or digital. 
We have uh, over the years, built up a lot of digital assets, 
so this will be yet another focus that we will take, where we got to, uh, 
digital, uh, investments. Uh… Panto, you have anything to add onto that? Yeah. 
Thank you, Vasinam. Uh, inaudible. Uh, uh, as an additional information from one pass, the end pass, you now 
mention. So, as you can see, we are, uh, transforming ourself from inaudible to become a digital inaudible. 
And we show it in them of, how we locate our capital to invest on the digital. 
Of, of course, we hope that by doing this, we will be able to cope with the, 
with the recent development of the digital world, and stay relevant to become uh, more and more close to our customer, 
and, uh, yet, we hope that, uh, our overall movement on digital, uh, 
initiative will uh, will have a positive impact on our uh, valuation multiple, uh, 
later on. That's overall strategy of that concern. Okay. Thanks, Panto. 
Appreciate that. Your next question comes from the line of Nico Margaroni's 
of BRI Benelexa. Please ask your question. 
Uh, thank you, uh, thank you to management, and uh, congratulations, I think, for the, for the good, uh, first quarter. Um… 
Three questions, but I think they're straightforward. 
Uh, first of all, uh, you mention about uh, evident margins, uh, guidance, for 2021 to be stable. 
Uh, can you break it down by uh, business billable? Uh, uh, mobile, uh, mobile in the home, and um, and, the enterprise business? 
Uh, that's my first question. 
Um, secondly, uh, how, how should we, uh, think about this, 
uh, uh, uh, uh, the consequences from a inaudible 72, in terms of data revenue? 
Uh, uh, 
so, uh, that, that, that, should mean that, um, going forward, there will be, uh, some revenue, uh, some data revenue being, being allocated, 
uh, under a legacy revenue. 
Um, is that, is that a fair, uh, understanding? 'Cause… That's number two. 
And uh, number three, uh, in terms of your, uh, 5G, 
uh, roll-outs, uh, and uh, you mentioned that that would be, uh, that would be within 2021. 
Uh, is that gonna be, uh, our retailer, for retail segment, or uh, uh, w- w- would it be selective roll-outs? 
How, how do you, um, plan in doing this? 
Uh, or is it, are you gonna be, uh, uh, initially, initially, uh, focusing on uh, the business segments? 
Thank you. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Uh, thank you, Nico, for uh, uh, your question. 
I will take the first question. 
On the retail margin data, the deadline is mentioned by, uh, uh, our CEO. We're going to have a inaudible evident margin. Uh, I 
cannot, uh, unfortunately, I cannot provide you a, uh, too much detail, uh, in the parent company, under evident 
margin for the business pillar, 
but uh, overall, uh, I think, uh, that uh, what we refer in 2020 this year, 
uh, of course the the, uh, under next, uh, higher evident margin coming from in the room, that was uh, highest one coming from telecom sell. 
And then, uh, uh, from wholesale, and uh, as we previously mentioned, 
we are in the, under process of uh, I think improving the enterprise, enterprise, uh, will be the smallest one. 
Uh, why we cannot provide with some detail on this one, 
uh, a lot of actually a common asset include in this uh, I think uh, accounting treatment, uh, to really understand under cost allocation here. 
I think that uh, I think, uh, a brief color, to you, Pat? Yeah, yeah, so… Yeah. 
Number two, I looked at the, the case of 22, actually, for the quarter four, we implement the basic 
second two. So, some uh, 
discu- we firstly allocate in the legacy. Currently, we review, and then we provision it, uh, if under usage, inaudible. So, 
this is actually the, you know, what I'm talk- we align with the, you know, pace, basic inaudible the funding, uh, of, of inaudible, and 
then going forward, it's gonna be consistent for us to allocate the expenditures by fund the person that 
uses it, so the data is, uh, the usage inaudible from data is gonna be allocated also professionally the data, and the inaudible gonna be consistent allocated for the legacy. 
So, I think for this year, it's gonna be consistent. We implement the basic inaudible. So the impact from the data is not gonna be happen, like, in quarter four. Thank you. 
That's you. Under… crosstalk Yeah. I think it is about that… Let me, let me answer it. Okay. Uh, by, uh, Nico, uh, for, for the 5G, uh, 5G is a bit different with 4G. Uh, with 4G, is, is for mass usage. 
Uh, he uh, the, uh, this year, for, for, for the counsel, 5G will be, 
uh, we will implement it selectively, not as a mass, uh, uh, as a mass roll- out of uh, network all over Indonesia. 
It will be, uh, selective, in certain area, and certain conditions. 
Uh, uh, uh, and it will be both for B2B and B2C. 
So, uh, uh, as a, as a leader in, in the technology implementation, 
their concern will be always would be, uh, good service, and uh, leading service to a customer, both for consumer and uh, B2B market. Uh, thank you. Thank you for, for the answer. 
We have another question from the line of Beus Chadhury of HSBC. Please ask your question. 
Yeah, thanks a lot. Um, I have three more questions. 
Firstly, on in the home, can you share what is the current home path samples, as of fiscal 20? 
And what are the network roll-out objectives and subs addition targets for 2021? 
Uh, secondly, you mentioned about synergy benefits with inaudible. Uh, can you give us some examples of how you are able to derive such benefits? 
And thirdly, on inaudible, what is the expectation for organic tower and tendency growth for 2021? Thank you. 
Okay, and for number one, for the inaudible 2020, actually for the inaudible for seven million, and for the fourth itself, inaudible. And… 
Sorry, it's not very clear, the voice. 
Okay. Hold on. inaudible in the 2020, uh, it's about 20.7, that is, uh, home path is ready for the in the home. And for the fourth itself, it's about 12.7 million. 
And the target- And the targets, first of all, in the 2021, actually, uh, there is still uh, potential target with connectivity for the inaudible, but uh, in the 2021, 
we will uh, more selective for this, 
and we believe we still can 
act, act it, 9.1 million, subsequently with in the home, and with some potential additional permits from six 
one access, uh, for the new customers. 
Uh, especially for the area that we have no idea with the uh, uh, infrastructure for in the home. 
inaudible inaudible Uh, uh, just let me add some, uh, I think, uh, some colorful new banners. 
Basically, uh, what uh, inaudible is uh, we expect to have additional about one million of the, uh, in the home. Uh, I think that inaudible. 
And also, in addition that uh, we also do expect we can help, uh, fix wireless access, um, five hundred inaudible. 
So this, uh, is going to bring us to about one, around 1.5 uh, million additional uh, I think, for uh, that 
been, that uh, in our uh, portfolio. Got it, Pat. Okay. Uh, inaudible from the counsel, 
um, with 
regard to your question about uh, synergy benefit from uh, uh, the counsel with the investments. So, uh, during our uh, first investment, we, 
we have, uh, several uh, if I'm not mistaken, pan-protege, uh, synergy initiative that we, we plan to implement, uh, during the collaboration. 
And until the first three months, we already launched five collaboration programs, 
and uh, uh, and, so for the- Okay. And, uh, uh, and so part of the, the, the result of that collaboration programs, and 
then the value that's derived from that collaboration program, is above what we expect. 
Uh, we, we can name it. One, one of it is we create a special package for a driver, Gojek driver, 
a special Telkomsel package, uh, data package for a Gojek driver. We collate a package for that, yeah? 
And then we also exchange our, uh, inaudible integration, uh, 
where our merchant and our pro-… uh, our project merchant and the Telkomsel outlet can, can use, uh, 
uh, uh, their advertising, uh, together. 
Basically the project merchant can use, uh, Telkomsel, uh, uh, digital advertising, things like that. 
And so far we see that, uh, the collaboration, uh, going forward with the project is, is going better and better. And we hope that, that the synergy value 
that we, uh, plan will achieve more than 100% this year. 
Okay. Thank you, crosstalk. Uh, on your… So a third question for inaudible. 
As previously mentioned, actually we are in the preparation for, uh, helping IPO for this, uh, company. 
So, uh, we pick up to this, uh, preparation and the process, uh. Unfortunately I cannot give you so much color on this one. 
We are only, uh, providing information that we already provide previously, and 
I think that's the maximum that we can provide, uh, uh, with… about respect to the compliant of the process. 
I think the tendency, if you… Well, if you remember, 
we have around 1, uh, 0.65 that are all objective, and our plan is to have this, 
uh, Mitratel ready for the IPO by the end of the year, 
subject to the market condition. I think, 
uh, that's the… Well, let's say the plan that we have today. 
Thank you, Barchetti. Understood. 
Another question from the line of Arthur Pineda of Citigroup. Please ask. 
Hi, hi. Uh, yeah, sorry. Two follow-up questions, please. Uh, 
I'm not sure if you can answer this, but can you share your thoughts on the remaining Telkomsel towers? Are there any plans for any further asset transfers over the long run? 
Uh, second question is on Telkomsel's proceeds, uh, given the prior sale… 
Uh, given that you do have the proceeds at hand, 
um, what are your thoughts on deploying the capital on that? Would you look to recycle it by, by doing dividends to shareholders, 
i.e. which is to Telkom, and, and Singtel? Or is it likely to be retained on the Telkomsel level? Thank you. 
Thank you very much for the question on the tower. This is Sunaman, uh, from, uh, Telkomsel. 
Now, uh, one of the key strategies that we have is always to look at how we can optimize our capital structure, 
and of course also unlocking the value. 
So we have done so with our towers. 
And your question is that, are we looking at more? 
So my answer is that there are… as, as long as there is an opportunity for us to u- unlock that value we will do so, 
and we will also do so according to, uh, market condition as well. 
So I hope that, uh, answers the question that you asked. 
Yes. And, um, on, on the capital that you received, is, is that just going to stay on Telkomsel? 
The, the, the capital? Yeah. Well, it is different totally, uh, because as you see the Telkomsel balance, it is very strong. 
So we… the capital that we get from the selling of the tower is distributed to the shareholders. 
Yeah. Uh, adding to what Sunny's, uh, explanation, actually the way we see it is like this. 
We, uh, don't reduce our investment in that tower. 
Basically, uh, proceeds coming from the sale of towers from Telkomsel that come in as dividends to Telkom, 
we put it in the Mitratel, actually, in there. So basically, uh, that is the way, uh, in practical how we manage the, uh, cash coming from that, uh, tower selling. Oh, okay. So there has already been a dividend paid out on… By, by Telkomsel- Yeah. to Telkom and… Okay, got it. Yeah. Okay. 
Thank you. 
We have another question from Niko Margaronis of BRI Danareksa. Please ask your question. 
Yes, thank you. Um, 
I would l-… I would like to pick up, uh, on the, on the Gojek collaboration, uh, and, the surveys 
that are found in the Bloomberg inaudible. And that, are you considering of increasing your investment in Gojek? 
Uh, could you provide some, um, some, some more color on this? I mean, what do you expect to achieve, uh, by increasing… by increasing your stake in Gojek? 
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah, thank you. crosstalk Niko, crosstalk from Telkomsel here. Yes. Yes. Uh, as, as we may 
aware, we, we, we, uh, invest in, in Gojek, and uh, we have the plan to continue to invest and collaborate with them. 
Of course as a strategic investor, one of, one of main, 
one of main proposal for investment is to get the synergy value between us and them, 
right? So, uh, we hope that, uh, in the, in the upcoming future with the recent development in Gojek, uh, we will increase our, uh, collaboration. 
So we will, uh… both parties will derive 
a, a, a synergy value from the synergy collaboration that will happen. 
And also, uh, as, as an investment also, we, we also hope that we can get a capital gain from our investment. 
So it will be both sides. Number one is, is in, in terms of a synergy value that we can derive, and the second one is from the capital gain that we invest. 
Right, right. Uh, thank you, inaudible. And 
if I may, uh, can I have a, a second question with, uh, regards to your, um… uh, to, to, to corporate 
actions? Uh, you mentioned about Mitratel a deadline, um, a timeline towards the end of the year for going IPO. 
I also picked up news about a data center, a data center business going IPO of, uh… by, by the, by the Telkom group. 
Um, could you provide also some, um, uh, color on this? Thank you. 
inaudible on data centers, data centers crosstalk. Okay. Um, uh, the data center that we are building now is a… 
as we call it, it is a hyper data inaudible. 
It's 
our first data center, it's a inaudible the use of the portal basically, and it should be ready probably in the, the third quarter of, of this year. 
And, and we also are actually, uh, as part of, of the data center we are 
also not only helping deploying what we call it as a apps data center, 
uh, toward the other 
countries. Now we have, uh, 22, uh, locations, but, uh, we plan to add, uh, some more locations, uh, that were supporting the, uh, the hyper schedule center. Yeah. Yeah, right. crosstalk the IPO? So crosstalk… Sorry. Well, sorry. For the IPO, 
I think that we, we… it, it still requires some time. Uh, we plan to consolidate the data center first, 
uh, and then, uh, we'll look at the others probably some time in early 2023. 
Okay. 
So let me 
confirm, late ' 23 you mentioned? Yeah. Uh, yeah, early 2023. Oh, early. So, uh, basically we have, uh, some data centers. I- it's just under our subsidiary Six 
Sigma, and also in Telkom International now, and their parent company as well. 
We're going to consolidate all that, uh, data centers, and including the potential for future b-… uh, development. 
Uh, inaudible about 81, uh, in the… still in the progressing of the inaudible 
scale, and this also… uh, I think we, uh, also potentially have… 
uh, we'll, uh, invite somebody else also who can bring technology, bring market, and so on to come to International as well in their partner team. 
Later on when we have this all ready, as mentioned, uh, before, we may come to the market in 2023 for example. 
Thank you. Very clear. 
Thank you, inaudible. There are no further questions from the line at this time. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.
