<foreign> Good morning and welcome to Banco Sabadell's 2021 Full Year Results Audio Webcast. 
As from previous occasions, the presentation will be run by our CEO Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno and our CFO Leopoldo Alvear. 
They will present the main highlights and details of the commercial and financial performance of the bank, both in the fourth quarter, as well as throughout the year. 
The presentation will be followed by Q&A session. We expect the presentation and the Q&A to last one hour altogether. 
Thank you again for your attendance and let me now hand it over to Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno. 
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Sabadell's annual result presentation. 
Moving to slide 4, 
commercial activity remains strong across all segments. 
Secondly, we have made significant steps forward in Sabadell's transformation, which is already yielding positive results. 
In addition, TSB has recorded a net profit of 130 million pounds in 2021 coming from 160 million pounds net loss in 2020. 
TSB continues to show good commercial momentum. 
Finally, Sabadell group recorded a net profit of 530 million euros in the year with a return on tangible equity standing at 5%. 
This figure for 2021 shows that Sabadell is heading in the right direction. 
In slide 5, our loan book grew by a solid 6.7% in 2021. 
We are meeting the objective set in our strategic plan, which included growing in our core geographies, Spain and UK, and shrinking the loan book in our international geographies. 
In terms of customer funds, both on and off balance sheet funds grow in the year as customers continue to increase their savings and investments. 
On the next few slides, we will go through the commercial performance of the different segments and products. 
Slide 6. In Spain, mortgages performed remarkably well in the year 
with new lending in 2021 growing by 38% versus 2020. 
Our mortgage/market share is up by 12 basis points. 
The good performance of mortgages has been driven by a strong demand throughout the year together with a product offering that includes an improved online simulator and a digital application platform for our customers. 
However, the most remarkable improvement in our value proposition has been the specialized relationship managers pilot 
launched in the last quarter of the year. 
I will cover this in more detail later on my presentation. 
Granting of new customer loans increased by 11% in the year as a result of the ongoing economic recovery. 
This growth has enabled us to gain stock market share during the year. 
In some, the positive commercial momentum in mortgages and consumer loans is also evident in our market shares for new lending, 
which keep growing and are ahead of our market shares for the existing stock. 
New insurance production in ' 21 was almost 30% larger than the one of the previous year. 
These dynamics has resulted in an increase of 74 basis points of our market share in life insurance premiums. 
Growth is mainly driven by the evolution of mortgage origination and the induced life insurance business it generates. 
Regarding mutual funds, assets under management in Spain grew by 18.8% in the year 
and our market share grew 11 basis points in the same period, mainly due to solid volumes of net inflows. 
Here, we keep benefiting from our partnership with Amundi. 
Moving on to slide 8, you can observe that payment related services are improving along with the economic recovery in Spain and easing of restrictions. 
Looking at our cards business, you can observe a very relevant increase in its turnover, which grew by 19% year on year. 
However, our market share declined in the year. 
This was partly due to the fact that the switch from cash to cards has impacted less our customers 
than the market as they were already heavy users than the average. 
Regarding payments through our point of sale devices, turnover increased by 18% in the year. 
Despite being a very relevant increase, we lost 75 basis points of market share. I will come back to this topic later in the presentation. 
Slide 9, as you can see in the upper right hand part of the slide, the volumes of new lending are still subdued in 2021 
due to the excess of liquidity that companies accumulated in 2020, mainly through loans guaranteed by <unk>. 
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that we have gained stock market share and that our positioning in this segment of the market remains strong. 
We expect demand for business lending to rise over the coming quarters and years. 
Firstly, the liquidity accumulated by companies through ECOL loans will go back to normal progressively. 
And on top of that, the deployment of next generation EU funds over the next few years will increase both private investment and bank financing. 
In this regard, a total of 11 billion euros have already been allocated in 2021 to the regional and local authorities, 
as well as to corporates and households. However, 
these fan funds have had very little traction over bank financing so far. 
The Spanish government has included 40 billion euros in its 2022 budget. 
Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the government has announced its intention to request, by 2023, the full amount of the 140 billion allocated to Spain. 
As a result, Spain will be receiving not only the 70 billion of grants, but also the additional 70 billion of loans 
in order to help companies, individuals, and public administrations navigate this crisis, go digital, and accelerate its transition towards a more sustainable economy. 
Slide 10. After having reviewed the origination and commercial performance of the year, let's have a look at the detailed evolution of our performing loan book by segmented products. 
Looking at the data in Spain, which is on the left hand side of the slide, you can see that we have managed to grow our loan book in our core segments, which are mortgages, 
consumer loans, and SMEs and corporates. 
In addition, as the result of the action taken in our international businesses, XTSB, 
the international loan book continues to reduce its size, as you can see on the right hand side of the slide. 
This is in line with our strategy of optimizing capital allocation and leveraging on the overseas market. 
A substantial part of this year on year reduction is driven by our di- divestment in Andorra. 
I would like to spend a bit of time in slide 11, sorry, it's a busy one, 
as it is useful to understand the rational behind our transformation and commercial initiatives. 
In the chart to the left, you can see the commercial performance of each product. 
On the x-axis, you can see that the percentual val- variation of business origination between 2021 and 2019. 
This illustrates how much of our origination is growing for each product when compared to pre- COVID levels. 
On the y-axis, you can see the stock market share variation for each product in 2021. 
This illustrates where our stock growth is beating the market or not. 
In the interest of time, I won't go through the details of each product, but let me share a brief summary of the graph and certainly it is informing the way we look at business. 
As you can see, there are four quadrants in the chart. In the two upper quadrants we are gaining market share 
and that is where most of our products are. 
With the products on the top right quadrant, we are also increasing our origination volumes versus pre- COVID levels. So we will keep pushing there. 
With the products on the top left quadrant, we are increasing market share, but with lower origination volume pre- COVID. 
We are ready there to grow when the market recovers. 
The products on the bottom quadrants are losing market share. 
On the bottom right quadrant, we only have two products: Cards and point of sale payments. We are growing volumes, but losing market share. 
In cards, we are assessing the situation and redefining our strategy. While in point of sale payments, 
we have been managing for profitability and not for volumes. 
Our profitability in this business is increasing despite the loss of market share. 
So there, it is a very decided in advance strategy. 
Finally, it is worth noting that we don't have any products decreasing both origination volumes and market share in the bottom left quadrant. 
Slide 12. You can see the details of how we are implementing a key element of our transformation in retail banking, which is the deployment of specialized relationship managers. 
As we have shared in the past, customers required specialized support and handholding to understand and contrast three, three key products: 
Mortgages, investments, and insurances. 
We are transforming a significant amount of our retail banking commercial team from being generalists relationship managers to being specialists in a specific product. 
In the last quarter of 2021, we launched a pilot with around 440 specialized relationship managers. 
The results of these pilots have been very positive as you can see in the slide. 
In insurance and investments, we are observing a higher productivity of these specialized RMs. 
In the case of mortgages, the sales process takes longer than in insurance or investments around three months. So it is still early to observe productivity improvements in terms of more sales. 
However, all mortgage leads generated ha- have now been managed in less than 24 hours, 
while in the past, the percentage was significantly lower and even over a longer periods of time. 
These together with other conversion metrics allow us to be optimistic about mortgage productivity improvement, as well as the other products I've mentioned in the coming months. 
We are preparing the deployment at the higher scale of specialized relationship managers for these three products early in the second quarter 
of 2022. 
We will increase our specialized relationship managers from 440 people to 1200 
by developing our current generalist relationship managers and converting them into product specialists. 
This is a radical shift in the way we originate and manage our retail business. 
Slide 13, a brief recap on some recent ESG initiatives and financing activity. 
In the left hand side, you can see some relevant initiatives and milestones achieved in Q4 in the fields of environmental, social, and governance. 
Regarding ESG finance in the year, our volume sustainable new lending in Spain reached 3.6 billion euros, 
while the new lending of social financing reached 3.4 million euros. 
These initiatives and figures are sign of our commitment to sustainability. 
In the next annual general meeting of Banco Sabadell, we will be releasing Sabadell's sustainability report where we will share detailed information on the topic. 
Looking at TSB in slide 14, its new lending volumes have grown by 50% in 2021 when compared to 2020. 
This has been driven by a booming property market in the UK, as well as by an attractive value proposition from TSB with shareholders. 
As you are all aware, the mortgage market has partially support, has been part reported by the stamp duty waiver in the first quarters of the year. 
However, on the left hand side, you can see that origination volumes at TSB were still high in the fourth quarter once the stamp duty waiver had been suspended. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see that these origination volumes contribute to the evolution of the stock of performing loans, where the book grows by 11% driven by mortgage growth. 
This growth in origination and stock volumes is reflected in our market shares. 
TSB, in slide 15, 
delivered a remarkable performance across all PNL lines and achieved the net profit of 130 million pounds in 2021. 
On the right hand side of the slide, NII and fees grew substantially while cost showed a downward trend. 
Regarding efficiency, TSB will advance in its restructuring plan, 
which will enable it to achieve a cost base of le- less than 730 million pounds by 2023. 
TSB continues to look for efficiencies. In this regard, it has recently announced that it will close further 70 branches in 2022. 
In addition, I would like to point out that TSB wrote back COVID provisions in the year due to an improved macroeconomic outlook in the UK. 
In some, TSB is focused on delivering on profitability and service quality. We see positive outlook for the future. 
Slide 16, we see that group's recurrent core results grew by 12.6% in the year. 
In the chart, we have excluded the effect of non recurrent costs in 2020 and 2021 in order to show the positive evolution 
of only the group's recurrent business. 
Without excluding the one-offs, these evolution will have been better, but we thought that these analysis would be misleading. 
The three components of recurrent cost results performed well in the year as you can see on the left hand side. 
Moreover, looking at the right hand side, the quarterly results had also positive momentum. 
They keep growing quarter by quarter as shown in the slide. 
Slide 17. And to finish with this part of my presentation, I would like to summarize the good financial performance we have delivered in 2021, 
which Leo will explain later in more detail. 
Firstly, NII grew on a year on year basis. 
Fees performed extremely well in the year while recurrent cost continued to follow a downward trend 
as a result of the restructuring plans undertaken in Spain and the UK. 
As we just discussed, the evolution of recurrent results was very positive. 
Furthermore, provisions in 2021 were substantially lower than the ones of 2020. Since then, we had the impact of the COVID pandemic. 
These positive results bring us to an annual net profit of 530 million euros and a return on tangible equity of 5%. 
Regarding capital, we committed to maintain a ratio of above 12% with a solid MDA management buffer and we have accomplished that. 
We closed the year with a 16 basis points increase in our core tier 1 ratio, which stood at 12.18. 
Furthermore, and this is relevant, this ratio has increased in a year in which our loan book grew by almost 7%. 
And with this, I will hand over to Leo to cover our financial results in more detail. 
Thank you, Cesar, and good morning, everyone. 
Uh, let's move on to the slide of, uh, financial results. And first, allow me to, uh, go through a quarterly PNL, 
where we have recorded a net profit of 161 million euros, a group level as you can see. 
These obviously contributed positively to the 530 million euros of net profit for the year that Cesar just presented. 
Our quarterly results were mainly impacted by three elements. 
Uh, on the one side, we have the <unk> and deposit guarantee scheme annual payments, 
which accounted to 149 million euros. And these, as you know, are usually accounted for in Q4 each year. 
Second, we have the capital gain on the disposal of renting businesses, which amounted as expected to 41 million euros in net terms. 
Remember these have, has no impact in, in taxes. 
And a positive of 56, uh, million euros in taxes as a result of fiscal assets, uh, reorganization. 
Additionally, and although we will later comment in more detail, we have recognized 19 million euros of extraordinary costs related to the closure of 70 branches 
at TSB, as men- Cesar mentioned before. 
Now, turning to the annual PNL, we see NII and fees growing in the year, which allows to have a growth rate for, uh, 3% in core banking revenues at group level. 
With regards to the cost line, recurring costs, excluding the resulting charges in Spain and UK, have declined by 2.3% in the year. 
This reduction, it's driven by the savings from deficiency plans launched back in ' 19 at TSB and 2020 in Spain, 
but they do not reflect yet, as we would later see, 
the 130 million euros savings that we expect from our latest efficiency plan, which was launched in three quarter last year, 2021, 
and it's expected to be finished by, uh, Q1 ' 22. 
All in all, the excluding 
the restructuring charges for both 2020 and 2021, 
our core results, this is the addition of, uh, NII, fees and costs increased by 12.6% in the year, 
underpinned by the solid NII and fee evolution, as well as the cost savings already achieved. 
Additionally, it is worth mentioning that total provisions went down by 46.2% in the year. 
This comparison obviously is affected by the extraordinary provisions made in 2020 related to COVID, basically 650 million euros. 
That we will dig, uh, a little bit deeper on this topic in the following slides. 
If we start with, uh, NII in slide, uh, number 20, uh, we can see that NII decreased by 1.6% on a quarterly basis. 
This was impacted by the ALCO bond disposals carried out in Q3, as we anticipated and already share with you in that quarter. 
The quarter revolution has been driven by different levers, which we can see in detail in the right hand side of this slide. 
Moving from left to right, the number of contribution to NII for the quarter has been 3 million euros higher. 
We have different inputs here. Front book yields have been pressured in the last quarter, 
specifically in the last month and in the corporate, uh, banking space 
as creditors sought, uh, to meet net lending targets, which was more than have said by tailwinds from FX and by higher loan volumes, particularly at TSB. 
The low contribution of the ALCO bonds together with excessive liquidity generated have had a negative impact of 17 million euros in line with our expectations. 
However, we will have the option to offset part of this impact by reinvesting excessive liquidity in government bonds through 2022. 
Marginally, we had lower wholesale fundings costs and some cover bonds matured during the quarter, which has been offset by other moving parts on the NNI line. 
We confirmed that we have met the ESB net lending target to benefit from the extra yield of the TLT03, which, as you know, was already accrued in NII. 
And, finally, as you can see on the bottom left part of this slide, the customer spread remain broadly stable in the quarter. 
In the next slide, we show the track record, uh, of NII every quarter, as well as obviously the full year accumulated. 
We've seen a positive growing trend Q&Q building from bottom levels seen in Q1 and this has allowed us to achieve a positive growth of 0.8% in the year 
in line with our Investor Day's guidance of low single digit growth for 2021. 
We've had an average quarterly NII of 856 million euros, which can be taken as a reference for 2022. 
And as you can see, it's below, um, Q4's, uh, numbers. 
Going forward, if we look at the expected evolution for 2022, we identify the following as the main moving parts. 
On the one hand, we will have a lower contribution of the AlCO portfolio bonds due to the disposals carried out in Q3, 
but we are also short of over 8 billion Euro bonds. And therefore, we have the option to reinvest, enhance, should offset most of this impact. This impact for 2022, 
uh, uh, only for the disposals made in Q3 was, is going to be minus 60 million euros. 
And as I said, we should be able to, uh, offset most of these impacts by the reinvestment, uh, of these bonds. 
On the other hand, we have the end of TLT03 benefits, which should reduce NII by around 75 million euros. 
And this, on the other hand, we will, should be offset by the positive mortgage market in the UK. 
This market is supported by volume growth, as well as interest rate hikes, and should more than offset potential margin compressions and, all in all, the impact from TLT0. 
It is also important to mention that we have not factored any rate change in 2022 in Spain 
and we have only taken into account 25 basic points in the Bank of England base rate. 
With all this in mind, we expect NII to remain flourish in 2022 
with all positive elements, especially TSB, contributing to naturalize the biggest negative impact, which will be TLT0, uh, contribution. 
Turning onto fees in slide 22, uh, group fees increased in the quarter by 10%, 
mainly driven by the positive seasonality related to asset management and insurance businesses success fees. 
The higher service income evolution is explained by the good performance of syndicated loans. Also, somewhat affected by seasonality 
and 3 million euros of non recurrent fees in TSB related to current accounts. 
On the other hand, asset management and insurance fees recorded a very positive quarterly performance with an increase of 25 million euros of which, as I mentioned before, 
17 are related to success fees. 
In any case, as mentioned, the quarterly evolutions is affected by positive seasonality, 
but as we can see, when comparing Q4 ' 21 with Q4 ' 20, which had its own seasonal success fees, figures are up 13.5%. 
Finally, when looking at the full year amounts, fees have grown north of 8% year on year. 
In the following slide, as we previously did with the NII, we show the evolution of fees every quarter, as well as the accumulated figure for the year. 
We've recorded a positive growth trend in fees as we saw the bottom levels in Q1. 
On the back of this evolution, fees have achieved a growth of 8.7% in the year, 
which allows to perform our investor days guidance of mid single digit growth for 2021. 
As was the case with the quarterly NII, you can see that our average fees per quarter in 2021, which should be the reference for 2022, 
was 367 million euros 
and is, again, below Q4 numbers. 
For next year, the continuation of the good performance in asset management and insurance fees, as well as the positive trend in economic activity, 
should be the main driver supporting this line. We respect a low single digit growth. 
Now, living the revenue line to one side and moving on costs in the following slide, we can see the total record costs slightly increased in the quarter 
as we have not yet seen the savings for the second phase of the efficiency plan in Spain 
and last quarters of the year always have, uh, or come along with some extraordinary volatility in expenses. 
In addition to this seasonal impact, this quarter, total costs also reflect 19 million euros of extraordinary expenses related to the closures of 70 branches at TSB that will take place during 2022. 
On an annual basis, and leaving 2020 and 2021's extraordinary costs aside, the restructuring charges, we 
can see that the underlying cost base is improving since it's decreasing by 2.3%. 
This is explained by the fact that savings from the execution of the first phase of the efficiency plan in Spain, 
as well as the restructuring plans at TSB, have already yielded positive results as we have been seeing through the year. 
These results can also be seen in the evolution of the group costs as a percentage of business volume, 
where we have reduced the weight of costs on our activity by eight basic points in the year. 
To end with the cost line, as we shared with you last quarter, 
we expect 85% of the 130 million euros in cost savings from the second phase of the efficiencies plan in the 
Spain to be already seen in 2022 and, of course, 100% of those savings to be seen in 2023 onwards. 
Taking these into account, we expect total costs to reduce around 110 million euros in 2022. 
In slide 25, 
we look at the recurrent core results 
include, as mentioned before, NII plus fees minus the recurrent costs. This is all cost, but the restructuring charges of both 2020 and 2021. 
As you can see, this quarter, group recurrent core results have increased by 3.6%, while, 
uh, on an annual basis, this number goes up to 12.6%. 
The different elements that led to wide adjust in the quarter are included in the left hand side of this slide. 
NII and costs contributed negatively, but this was more than upset by the positive of evolution of fees. 
In the case of NII, as we've seen, it shows a solid underlying evolution despite the lower contribution of the AlCO bonds, 
while recurrent costs grew slightly as a consequence of the seasonal impacts that we mentioned, uh, before. 
On the contrary, as we saw too, fees have had a very strong performance offsetting both effects. 
For 2022, we expect this positive trend just to continue. And this will be driven, as mentioned before, 
by a flattish expected NII by growth in fees and, more importantly, by a significant reduction in costs, the 110 million euros mentioned before, 
therefore providing a high single digit growth in recurring core results. 
Now, leaving the, those aside and moving on to cost of risk, the group's year to date credit cost of risk stood at 49 basic points. 
If you recall, this was 51 basic points as we closed Q3 and 53 basic points in June. 
The group's total cost of risk, including all the provisions in the quarter, the before mentioned credit impairments with the provisions of foreclosed assets, the NPA management costs 
and other provisions for many legal and fiscal risks, 
risks reached 72 basic points, basically stable, uh, compared, if compared with Q3 numbers. 
Analyzing the Q4 in detail, we see credit provisions amounted to 195 million euros, which is as slight decrease of 1% in the quarter, 
where TSB released more provisions due to better macroeconomic UK, uh, uh, or outlook in the UK 
driven by lower unemployment rates and higher house pricing index. 
The release is similar to the one accounted in the second and third quarter of the year. 
Taking a view at the breakdown of total provisions at the top right hand side, we booked the a fore mentioned 195 million euros of loan loss provisions, 
also 23 million euros for charges on foreclosed assets, whereas costs related to management of NPAs were booked at 44 million euros. 
And finally, 52 million euros were recognized for other provisions. And these number is impacted by 25 million euros in extraordinaries, 
as a more cautious approach was accounted for contingent and litigation risks. 
And this should provide a lower pressure, uh, in these provisions for 2022, 
especially taking into account, and this is important in my opinion, that no new sources of litigation risks have risen in 2021. 
As you have seen throughout 2021, 
these three items, foreclosed assets, NPA management costs, and other provisions have remained reasonably stable in the quarter, or quarter on quarter, 
just affected by extraordinary events that we have been sharing with you. 
These provision levels have allowed us to slightly beat our guidance and, in the year, with the cost, credit cost of risk and total cost of risk slightly lower than H1 levels. 
In order to see how 2022 could evolve in terms of cost of risk, it's worth mentioning or reviewing, first, the part 
of the credit book that enjoyed or is still enjoying payment holidays or equal guarantees. 
Beginning with the loan portfolio benefited with payment holidays in Spain, basically retail, as of today, 100% of the total moratoria has granted has expired. 
Of the total of 3.5 billion euros granted, 
500 million euros have already been fully amortized while the remaining 3 billion are all back paying down principle, as mentioned before. 
On the total payment holidays granted or of the total, uh, payment holidays granted, 12% are in stage three. 
With- within that stage three, loans classified are unlikely to pay account for last minority, almost or more, a little bit more than 80%. 
It is important to note that the percentages of loans in stage three have remained stable quarter on quarter 
while the percentage of payment holidays expired have been growing towards the current 100% of the quarters. 
The starting point in Q1, 16% of stage three was due basically to the fact that the first moratoria to expire were those based on consumer loans, which by definition imply a higher risk than the mortgage loans. 
Additionally, as mentioned before, 14% of the total payment holidays granted have been already amortized, the before mentioned, 500 million euros. 
And this, this portfolio is represented by a larger amount of consumer loans, 
where two-third of the total loans granted, consumer loans granted under this program have already been fully amortized. 
Moving onto the eco state guaranteed loans, this quarter, we have granted 260 million euros, so the total outstanding amount drawn to date is 8.6 billion euros, 
where state guarantees cover an average of 76%. 
Once the deadline for the request of potential extensions has come to an end, more than 60% of the eco exposures are already facing principle payments in 2021. 
Whereas, the best part of the remaining 40%, approximately 80%, 
will end their grace period and therefore start repaying principle in Q2 2022, 
as you can see in the graph at the bottom right hand side of a slide. 
From a risk quality perspective, it is important to note that <inaudible> 5% of these eco loans are already classified in stage three. 
And out these 5%, 60% are unlikely to pay. 
This is, they're not past due more than 90 days. 
Moving on to the next slide, for 2022, we expect some catalysts in cost of risk to provide a downward trend in provisions. 
First, let me briefly guide you through the evolution of cost of risk for this year, as it is shown on the graph on the left hand side of the slide, 
both credit cost of risk and total cost of risk end of the year converging to more normalized figure. 
Looking at the breakdown of the loan book, allow me to highlight the main drivers that we expect will support a positive trend in credit cost of risk. 
Through this, we divide the book, as we have shared before, in three different sub portfolios. 
The sub portfolio, uh, or the portfolio, which has not been affected by either moratoria or payment holidays, 
the portfolio covered with eco guarantees and, lastly, the portfolio which receive payments holidays. 
First, let us share our views for the non-affected part of the book, which is by far, obviously, the largest of the three. 
It represents 92% of the total. This is around 143 billion euros. 
The portfolio, this portfolio has had a very good performance in terms of credit quality in 2021. We have not seen anything extraordinary. 
And as we have been sharing with you, the net influence have remained at better than expected levels throughout 2021. 
We believe this tendency will continue in 2022 on the back of an even better 2021, better than 2021's macroeconomic outlook. 
Secondly, we have the eco loan portfolio, where we have not seen any material deterioration today. 
In fact, we have taken a conservative approach this quarter 
to advance some loss recognitions for those cases where we have seen or anticipated any potential significant increase in risk. 
The evolution of this book will be linked to the development of the loans that will start to face principle payments from Q2 onwards, as explained before. 
In any case, I think it's very important to remember that these exposures are covered with a state guarantee by 76%, 
therefore reducing any potential customer risk effort to just 24% of the total exposure. 
And thirdly, we have the payment holiday portfolio, where, as mentioned before, 100% of the payment holidays have already expired, 
where the level of NPLs have remained stables since, uh, June, basically. 
This evolution, as well as the more constructive microeconomic environments, allow us to believe that this portfolio will not generate further NPLs nor, obviously, cost of risk in 2022. 
Therefore, considering all these drivers, we believe that credit cost of risk for 2022 should land between 2021's and 2019's. 
In terms of the total cost of risk trend for 2022, let me review different dynamics across the different comp- concepts. 
Keep in mind, as we discussed earlier, that excluding extraordinaries, this land should be reasonably stable. 
In foreclosed assets, we will not have the 40 million euros of extraordinary provisions related to branch grocers that were booked for in 2021. 
NPA management, I believe, uh, costs should remain reasonably stable in 2022. 
And finally, in terms of other provisions, which are basically, as I said, as I mentioned before, litigation and fiscal risks, 
we believe that, uh, we performed significantly better than 2022 
among other things because we have front-loaded 25 million euros in 2021. 
And moreover, on top of this, as mentioned before, we see, uh, no new sources of risks in 2021, and therefore, these lines should improve in 2022. 
In conclusion, these drivers should allow, uh, for the total cost of risk to improve further also in 2022. 
As always, in the final section of the presentation, we will review the asset quality dynamics, the liquidity, and the capital. 
Starting by asset quality, we showed the evolution of our problematic assets and let's start with NPLs in, uh, slide number 30. 
NPLs have had an increase in the year of 395 million euros, 
but this has been impacted by one of items that we will see in detail in a minute. 
And as a result, our NPL, uh, ratio also went up by six basic points up to 3.65% 
while the total coverage on NPLs remains, uh, stable at 56%. 
The outcome, as we have been sharing with you over quarter, has been significantly better than what we had budgeted at the beginning of the year. 
As per the increase of the 395 million euros in NPLs, 
I think it's worth taking into account that most of the movement has been due to non recurrent items. 
So, on the one hand, you might remember 
TSB in Q1 had an extraordinary increase of 190 million euros, which was related to regulatory changes for the definition of default of their market portfolio. 
The evolution since then has been very stable. 
And additionally, we have had 150 million euros of NPL portfolio report changes throughout the year. 
These report changes are linked to the portfolios that were sold in 2019 and 2022. 
Therefore, we don't expect any further impacts going forward because all the portfolios have been cleaned, if you wish. 
In addition, our exposures across stages have remained broadly stable Q on Q, as well as our stage three coverage, which stands at 41.2%. 
And finally, I think it's worth remembering that half of our current NPLs are classified as unlikely to pay. 
Now, in terms of foreclosed assets and foreclosed NPAs in slide 31, 
you can see that the stock of foreclosed assets declined by 11 million euros in the year representing less than 1.4, uh, billion euros. 
Coverage, uh, ratio for this portfolio slightly in increased up to, uh, 38%. 
Regarding total NPAs, the stock went up, uh, and amounts to 7.6 billion euros, which is explained by the previously mentioned increase in NPLs, 
while the coverage remained, uh, steady at 53%. 
Finally, the gross and net NPA ratios stand at 4.4% and 2.1% respectively 
with a year on year and a quarter on quarter evolution that have remained properly stable. 
Moving now into liquidity. Uh, we see that the group ones again and that the quarter and the year with the record liquidity position. 
This can be reflected in an LCR of 221% on 57 billion euros worth of high quality liquid assets, launch depot, 
uh, end the quarter at 96%. So it's pretty, pretty solid numbers, in my opinion. 
We have, uh, uh, in terms of European Central Bank funding, currently have 32 billion euros of outstanding to TLT03. 
And in terms of TFSME for the UK, we currently have 5.5 billion pounds outstanding, of which 2.5 were, uh, drawn in the quote. 
And as per a capital opposition, we continue generated capital even under a material non book increase environment. 
Our CD1 fully loaded ratio stands at 12.18% at year 
end, having increased by 16 basic points in the year, while our loan book has expanded over 6 billion euros. 
Now, when we look at the quota's evolution, 
we see an increase derived basically by our organic capital generation, despite the contributions to E-deck and the, the bonds, deposit guarantee schemes, 
uh, in the quarter 
and also accruing a 31.8% cash payout. 
Another positive movement, it's the strategic, uh, disposals that we have been sharing with you through the year, 
uh, basically renting business in Andorra, who's contributed with 17 basic points, um, as expected. 
It also should be noted that this quarter, 
we have front-loaded a big part of the impact that we shared with you in previous quarters that we were expecting for the EBA guidelines. 
We were expecting 15 basic points for 2022 and we have front loaded 10 of those 15 in 2021 in this quarter. Therefore, 
the only regulatory impact that we expect for 2022 is just a minor five basic points coming from these EBI, uh, guidelines. 
From a regulatory perspective, CT1 ratio, uh, stood at 12.43% on a phasing basis 
and consequently, our MDA buffer now stands at 391 basic points, 
having increased by 78 basic points in the year. 
This buffer, as you might remember, is above our target of 350 basic points. 
And we see it increase in the future since what we've seen, what we have for- forecasted for 2022 is an increase in CT1 fully loaded. 
To conclude this section, the following slide shows you our current <inaudible> position and the requirements for 2024. 
As we are already compliant with all targets, uh, the ones based on risk rate assets, the ones based on leverage ratio, and also the subordinated ones, 
our issuance plan will be therefore focused on optimizing the funding costs and the funding sources, as well as keeping our capital buckets full 
and a number of management buffer. 
And with this, I hand over to Cesar, who will conclude our presentation today. 
Thank you, Leo. To finish our result presentation today, I will like to recap on the targets achieved in 2021. Uh, 
I would like to signal that 2021, we have reached all targets set in our strategic plan. 
On the strength of, uh, core results and perspective for cost of risk as per the guidance Leo just provided, 
we are bringing forward our 2022 the more than 6% return on tangible equity target. 
Finally, the board has approved to propose at the next annual general meeting a cash dividend payment of three cents per share, 
which implies a slightly higher than 30% payout and a dividend yield of around 5%. 
And with this, I will hand over to Geraldo to kick off our Q&A. Thank you. 
Uh, thank you, Cesar. Uh, we will now begin the Q&A session. 
Uh, we will love to take questions from all of you and there are already many of you in line. 
So I would currently ask you to, uh, try to, to, uh, make a reduced number of questions, if possible, please. 
Operator, could you please open the line for the next question? Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. 
Hi. G- good morning, uh, Cesar and, and Leo. 
Um, my question really about NII. Um, 
I mean, in, in slide 21, I think, Leo, you, you mentioned the, the, the 856 quarterly average as the reference for 2022 and, and there's three 
tailwinds, three, three headwinds. 
Uh, is, is, is that… should we interpret the flat is, is a good sort of level of guidance and, uh, or, or am I misinterpreting it? 
And related to that, uh, can you maybe discuss what your loan growth sort of assumptions are and how you see loan growth panning out in particular in Spain 
and in the UK? Um, the margin sort of, uh, was down, um, in Q4, 
uh, and, and, obviously, the rates is, is very, uh, it's, it's, rates are gonna go up and potentially three or four times this year. 
Uh, can you, can you maybe just walk us through the race entity, which we know, but how much of that, in particular, could be computed away? What, what do you think, uh, could be computed away? 
Thank you. Okay. Let, let me give it the first shot and then I'll, I'll let, uh, Leo. 
Uh, when we look, um, forward, we, we, yes, think, uh, that, uh, NII should be flattish, 
because, uh, uh, although the AlCO portfolio, uh, disposal of, uh, this year 
will be partially mitigated by reinvestment in government bonds and there the higher yield curve will help. 
And also, it will be helped by wholesale, uh, funding costs. T he net effect should be negative. 
Also the TL, uh, uh, TLT0 that ends in June ' 
22, uh, there we think that it will be more than offset, and this links to your second question, more than offset by TSB 
because, uh, TSB, although margins are going to have some pressure, 
will benefit from two significant factors, which here, which are higher volumes and higher interest rates by the Bank of England. 
And our Bank of England rates in our numbers are relatively conservative and we might see some further tailwind 
In Spain, as you have seen, we are gaining market share across all products, basically. 
And, uh, therefore, we consider that the volumes will continue to be healthy 
and will be offset somewhat by marching corporation. 
So, overall, uh, our guidance and you're writing, reading, uh, Leo's message, 
our guidance is more or less, uh, flattish. 
I think I have kind of answered the, the volumes, uh, response. We spend, uh… we're expecting volumes in Spain, low single digit growth across the different segments, 
continuing, hopefully to gain market share in all products, that's mortgages, consumer loans, SMEs, and corporates, as we did in ' 21. 
The tailwind of the next generation EU fund will come more in the second part of the year, uh, the 40 billion that we were mentioning 
before. And in UK, we are foreseeing a mid single digit growth in, in volumes. 
Leo, I don't know if you want to add. Uh, 
I think you, you answered most of it. Let me just put some numbers, if you wish, uh, onto that note so, so that we are as clear as we can. 
So, basically, um, for the ALCO book, as we mentioned in third quarter, and I can refresh now, 
uh, we… I mean, if we compare our current outstanding balances and the yield that we had in 2021 versus the one that we would have with those outstanding balances in 2022, 
we would have a negative impact of minus 60 million euros of contribution, but 
we are short of 8 billion euros of bonds, 
and we expect to, um, take advantage of the, uh, rate, uh, uh, movements, long term rate movements now. 
So we expect that, uh, we will reinvest, 
uh, uh, uh, all or a big part of that, uh, uh, portfolio through the year. 
So we should compensate most of that impact, 
not total because, you know, we will take time until we rebuild those, those, those, uh, portfolios with good rates, but most of that should be compensated. 
Remember that in this current context, it's not only the yield that you get out of the bonds, but also the, the, the, the reduction of the excess of liquidity, which is very important. 
Um, the second impact is still zero minus 75 billion, uh, million euros, sorry, uh, for, for next year. 
Um, we believe, as Cezar explained, that these will… we should be more than offset by, uh, the TSB evolution. 
TSB, we need to remember that, uh, we are counting on volumes next year, but it's not only volumes of 2022. We have to remember that TSB grew, uh, well over 11% this year 
and what we have, uh, from first January, it's the total volumes that we ended with, uh, with, we ended with in Q4. 
So it's, it's significantly higher than Q1 ' 21. 
So these, these adds also a lot of money for, or a lot of NII for, uh, 2022. And on top of that, we're expecting to increase volumes in TSB, uh, in, in ' 22. 
Now, in terms of rates, I think we've been reasonably, uh, uh, conservative, if you wish. So, for Spain, we have not considered any rate movement. 
I know there are a number of, uh, brokers that are coming now with, uh, more optimistic, uh, uh, views in the last, uh, few weeks, but we have considered zero. 
And in terms of TSB, we've only considered 25 basic points. While in the market now, it's probably facing more to 100 this year. 
Uh, so, I think, if anything, that should help, in any case. Uh, I'm, I'm talking about the NII sensitivity that you mentioned, uh, um, Alvaro. 
We need to remember that, uh, basically, um, higher interest rates take some time to flow into, into NII, you 
know, uh, because it takes time to reprise all the asset side, 
you know. So, I think, um, in terms of sensitivity, we have a little bit more sensitivity in TSB than in Spain, 
uh, but in a different context, if you allow me to explain it this way. 
While in Spain or continental Europe, um, um, <inaudible> is still at minus 50, so deep negative. 
We don't expect that any rate movement, whenever that comes, will have an impact on the liability sites, you know, because, as I said, 
the rates are still very, very negative, you know. So I think, uh, uh, any, uh, movement in rates, whenever it comes, 
should be more or less trespassed, fully trespassed to NII. 
In TSB is a little bit different because the rate is already positive and it's at 25 basic points. 
So when looking at, uh, the NII sensitivity, we have to take an assumption regarding, 
uh, how much of that interest, uh, rate hike would be passed through to the deposit. 
But in general terms, in general terms, 
the sensitivity to NII for the group and for TSB, uh, uh, should be around 2% to 3% of NII for every 10 basic points movement. 
But please remember that the impact of these NII movements as we have shared before is much more concentrated on the second year than in the first year 
because, as I mentioned before, it takes time to reprise the, the asset side. 
Uh, thank you. Um, please, could we move to the next question? 
Next question come from the line of Mark Machin from GB Capital. Please ask your question. 
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation and taking the questions. I have two, um, if I may. 
The first one is on taxes. I would appreciate if you could take us through the fiscal adjustments you included in the quarter. 
And the second one is on profitability. 
Uh, you've brought forward the, about 6% return on taxable equity target to 2022. I was wondering if you include any provision rever- reversals at TSB in the guidance. 
And also, now that things are going in line or even better than expected, why don't you want to be more bullish on the 2023 target? Thank you. 
I'll leave the, the taxes, uh, to you, Leo, and, uh, give a very, very high level on the profitability. 
Uh, on the profitability to your specific question, if there's, uh, something about, uh, reversion, uh, in TSB, 
we have there still, uh, 30 million of potential reversion, 
but that's not the material in, uh, our consideration of the profitability. The profitability of the 6% 
is coming basically from, uh, <inaudible> NNI, low single digit in fees, 
contribution of 110 million of, 
uh, the saving cost, and a significant reduction in, uh, in, in risk cost. 
So that's the main origin of the profitability looking forward and our confidence in the more than 6% for 2022. 
But I leave Leo on the taxes. Sorry, uh, on 20… yeah, for more than 6% on 2022. 
We are not, uh, giving any, uh, guidance for 2023 
because, uh, we think that it's a little bit too early. This is just, uh, eight months, uh, eight months old and we don't think we should change the plan at this point in time. 
But, certainly, we are more optimistic about beating the plan 
as we stand, uh, beating the plan of 2023 as we stand today as it's, uh, quite obvious from the numbers we are, have shown today. 
And, uh, with the regard to taxes, uh, basically, in Q4, we closed, uh, some subsidiaries. we've come from, from around 10 years ago. Uh, some, some real estate subsidiaries, 
um, that allowed us to contribute or consolidate 56, uh, million euros, sorry, yeah, million euros of, of fiscal, uh, 
assets, you know. So, basically, this has an impact, a positive impact in PNL, which is the one that you've seen, but has no impact in, in capital 
because basically there are tax losses carried forward. So basically they're deducted from, from CT1. 
This is a one off, uh, uh, impact that, uh, was due to arrive in this quarter. 
Thanks a lot for the questions, Max. Oh, sorry. Yeah. On, on, on one more thing. 
Uh, remember that also in this quarter, we have the profit coming from the renting disposal, which is tax free, okay? 
It, it does not contribute to, to, uh, the income tax. 
Thanks lot for the questions. Uh, let's move on to the next caller, please. 
Next one from the line of Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas. Please ask your question. Uh, hi. Yes. 
I have, uh, two questions. 
Um, one on fees. Um, I mean, you have just sort of like gone through the NII, 
but was wondering a bit on the low single digit, um, growth in fees, are the main drivers behind. 
And then, um, a very 
quick one on the strong corporate lending growth production in the fourth quarter, 
how should we see that sort of like impacting NII, um, in 20- in 2022, particular in the first quarter? I mean, can I assume that a lot of the learning growth, syndicated learning growth activity has been back and loaded in the quarter? 
So, so if you, yes, could elaborate a bit on, on the dynamics of our portfolio in margins 
and in NII. Thank you. 
Should I take them, 
if you wish? Uh, so first, on, on fees, um, we had a very good year for 2021. It was better than what we expected. We guided for mid single digit growth. 
We almost did 9%, uh, and I think, uh, um, yeah, we're very happy about, uh, the evolution. 
We are still seeing, uh, good momentum in 2022. 
Uh, there's a number of things that should help us increase our, uh, fees in 2022, but we see a little bit less, uh, um, of an evolution 
than the one that we had in ' 21 because it was very big. So, basically, uh, that's why we're guiding for a low single digit, uh, uh, growth. Now, we're fairly confident that we can achieve it. 
This is based on basically the very positive, uh, um, commercial momentum in terms of AUMs. We're very happy with the evolution of AUMs. 
I mean, um, when I look back now, basically, we are only 10, 10% behind 
what we were making in terms of fees and commissions in AUMs before we sold the asset manager last year. 
So, basically, um, we are about to complete a one year payback, which is, in my opinion, quite impressive. 
And this is because, um, yeah, the, the kind of products that we are putting, uh, uh, or that we're showing our, our customers 
was much better than what we could do on a standalone basis before. 
And therefore, we are, we're getting quite a lot of momentum on this regard and we expect certainly these to continue in 20, uh, 22. 
We're also thinking that we can maximum, uh, some increases in terms of insurance, uh, 
basically, uh, if only, uh, based on the evolution of our mortgage volumes and the insurance related to them. 
So we are, we are, um, positive in that regard. 
And then activity, you know. We believe that, uh, um, the activity will, has to recover more in 2022 on the basis of the macro context, you know. 
So we're fairly optimistic in, in fees in ' 22, but, uh, uh, we don't think we will be able to achieve the numbers that we achieved in ' 21 because they were 
basically, uh, better than what we were, um, that we were thinking, 
you know. So, positive, but low single digit. 
And in, with regards to, uh, your second question, uh, we saw in the quarter, uh, some pressure on, um, 
the, um, margins of especially corporate banking. 
Uh, you know, banks were, were, um, wanted to make certain that they were going to achieve the net land in 
targets, uh, and therefore, especially in December, we saw a little bit of a drop in, um, in prices, 
uh, but I think it was a, a very seasonal impact in my opinion. It was driven by this issue that I, that I mentioned, uh, before, you know. 
And in terms of volumes for next year, as Cesar was mentioning, we, we believe that we should keep on growing on this, on this segment, you know. I mean, on, on, on the SME segment, you 
know. Uh, next year, or, sorry, this year in ' 
22, we have the, we, we should start seeing the impact of the next generation fund, but I think this is going to be, in my opinion, back loaded to the second half of the year. 
But despite that, I think, um, the, uh, recovery of the economy should, uh, should improve, uh, the numbers here. Not something specticular, 
uh, spectacular, sorry. Uh, as Cesar mentioned before, we've seen low single digit growth volumes for Spain, um, in ' 22. 
Thank you. Uh, let's move, please, to the next question. 
Next one comes on the line of Marta Sanchez Romero from Bank of America. Please ask your question. 
Hello. Good morning. My first question is on the AlCO portfolio. 
Can you please elaborate a bit more the volumes you could be adding and what are you buying? 
Because you can get a bit of a yield now, but you're incurring in a lot of duration risk, particularly if the reflection is, is, is here. Um, I don't know if, if it's a very consistent strategy. 
And the second question is on asset quality. 
Um, can you please, uh, provide a bit more color on, on those repurchases of, of MPL portfolios? What is there? Um, and could we see more? 
And then more generally, what is your outlook for NPL increase in 2022? 
We've seen that NPLs are up. 
Uh, you are a bit of an outlier here. Banks that have reported so far, uh, have shown very, very sound NPL trends. 
And also, on asset, on, sorry, on coverage, your stage three loan coverage has dropped to 41%. It seems low, particularly when 
they say state three loans are going up. Thank you. 
Sure. So, on volumes, as I mentioned before, 
we are now short of 8 billion euros of, uh, uh, bonds, if we compare it to September, 2020, which is when we started, uh, uh, selling bonds in order to fund the restruction plans. 
Uh, as I mentioned, there is a chance that we reinvest those bonds. I, 
I do not fully agree with your view on this regard. I think, um, obviously, if we buy bonds, it's going to be in the help to collect portfolio. 
So, uh, it shall have no impact in, in capital in any case, uh, going forward. 
And I think we need to remember that it's not only, uh, the yields that we're getting out of the, of the bonds that we buy, but access liquidity, which is costing us 50 basic points at the current day, you know. 
As I said, um, with these, 
um, with the construction of this portfolio in 2022, we're probably not gonna be able to fully offset 
the impact of the minus 60 million euros that I mentioned before because it will take time to build this portfolio and we're gonna be opportunistic with the yields, 
but I think it should help to, uh, to offset most of it. 
Uh, with regards to us equality, basically what we had in the, in the year was a flow back of 150 million euros in NPLs. 
I think it's, it's worth seeing the context of this. 
This is 150 million euros on the back of 
over 10 billion euros of transactions of the disposals of these portfolio. So, barely, I don't know, 1.6% of the total. 
And the reasons for these are basically, uh, two. On the one hand, in NPLS is, uh, the difference, um, between the <inaudible> and, and, and the <inaudible> of the closing, which is basically 
that the <inaudible>, uh, identified assets is not eligible, 
uh, uh, loans related to social housing, uh, loans that have been repossessed during that period, et 
cetera, et cetera. Now, this is absolutely normal. 
I've seen it, um, in, in my previous job. I've seen it everywhere. 
I think it's the numbers, in my opinion, are not, are not very, very relevant. 
And then there's also another impact in the, in the case of foreclosed assets. And this is due to the <inaudible>. Uh, when 
this was, uh, implemented, uh, any repossessed assets sold that did not meet the new, uh, <inaudible> would 
have to be reverted to the bank. And these <inaudible> are coming back to the bank in the forms of, uh, NPLs. 
In any case, um, we do not see any impact going forward because the portfolios that were shelved in 2019 and 2020 are really clean. 
So this was more of an historical issue, uh, uh, that was pending to, to finish, if you wish, and not, uh, uh, and not anything that we still have going forward. 
So this is 150 million of the movement of NPLs. 
The NPLS moved 395 million euros in the year 
and we also have another specific impact, which accounted to 190 million euros, uh, in Q1, uh, and was derived from, uh, TSB as explained before. 
So, all in all, uh, we are saying that, uh, 350 of the 395, uh, uh, um, million Euro growth in NPLs in the year 
are basically explained by these two factors. 
Uh, in my opinion, uh, an evolution of, uh, um, 40, 50 million euros in, in, in 2021 of increase of NPLs, well, we're very happy with it. 
I think it's much, much better than what we ever could imagine, you know, in 20- 
in 2021, you know. So, for next year, what's the outlook, you know? As I tried to explain before, uh, dividing the three different buckets of the portfolio that we have, 
you know, uh, on the vast majority of the portfolio, over 90 perc, 90% of the portfolio, which is not affected by neither moratoria nor <inaudible> trend is very good, has been very good in ' 
21 and I don't see a reason to, um, believe that the trend should not be at least the same or even better in 2022, 
you know, because the macro is, is holding up very well, real estate prices are going up, unemployment rate is going very well, and, and GDP should grow from 5% to 6% next year. 
On the second book moratoria, I think that's done. Uh, as I mentioned before, you know, everything is already paying, uh, uh, 
500 million out of the 3.5 or half already been amortized. 
So we don't expect neither, uh, new NPLs nor, um, basically, uh, um, um, any kind of cost of risk for 2022, you know. 
And on the eco book, uh, well, we, we, um, anticipated, uh, and front loaded a little bit of NPLs this quarter, uh, out of that book. 
Um, as I said, we have around 5% of the book, uh, classified as a stage three. 
And out of that, 60% is unlikely to pay. Therefore, it has not, uh, passed due over 90 days. 
Uh, we will see. And we need to wait a little bit on, on how these evolves. And 
I think the, the trigger here for us and, I believe, the sector 
will be second Q next year, because 80% of the remaining exposure that is not paying principle today, uh, will start, uh, in second Q. 
Uh, but in any case, um, the impact of these in cost of risk, I think, uh, well, it's certainly, 
uh, um, reduced given the fact that 76% of these book is covered by state guarantees. Therefore, 
we only have to provide for the remaining 24% in terms of cost of risk. 
So, for overall movement in NPLs, 
I'm not certain whether we, we have seen the peak at the end of 2021, but I believe that if we have not seen that peak. 
Uh, the movement in 2022 should not be relevant in, in my opinion. 
Thanks a lot. Let's move on to the next question, please. 
Next one, come the line of Benji <unk> from Jeffries. Please ask your question. Uh, yes. Good morning, everyone. It's Benji, um, here at Jeffries. 
Uh, just a question on the cost guidance, please. 
Um, perhaps if you could just split out a little bit more detail, um, the moving part between the expected savings in 2022, 
um, versus, you know, the underlying inflation, um, wage drift, et 
cetera. Uh, and perhaps more specifically, just in terms of the outlook for wage growth going forward, 
is there any terms, um, or deadlines that we should be aware of, um, just post the recent head count reduction agreements with unions, um, that might impact upon, 
um, wage growth and the potential impact on inflation 
going forward? Thank you. 
Sure. So, basically, um, as, uh… it's maybe four. 
We are expecting 85% of the expected savings out of our, uh, second efficiency plan, which we are now basically, um, 
um, executing to, uh, be reflected in our numbers in ' 22 already. 
Uh, we are out of, um, at the end of January, basically, around 50% of the efficiency plan will have already been executed. 
So that's why we are confident that we will, and the remaining 50% will be executed in February and March. 
So we are… that's why we're very confident that we will achieve these, uh, at least these 85%, you know. 
On the… uh, so that's in, in, in, you know, in case we're very confident that we can, we can, uh, meet those, uh, those targets, you know. 
As per the, the inflation, yes, there is inflation in costs, but, uh, it's basically 
linked to electricity or the most, the biggest part of that, it's linked to electricity. 
So while inflation is, uh, over 6% in Spain, 
if we go to, um, uh, the pot that should be, or could impact our, 
uh, um, 
our costs, uh, it's probably more linked to the service, inflation, 
and that's more around 2% in any case we are fighting to try to reduce that, uh, in this year. 
And we have some cost efficiency initiatives in order to, uh, offset that, 
uh, efficiencies in, in, in the field of, of, I don't know, the amount we are, we are spending on consultancy, 
um, uh, the amount that we are, uh, spending in, in, um, physical mailing, uh, driven by the fact that our clients want 
to, uh, relate with us, uh, through digital and not physical. And that… well, it, it seems, 
it seems silly, but there's a lot of money in, in that, uh, physical mailing. So I think we can, we can save there, uh, some money. 
And then, as per your last question, which was wage inflation for this year, we are accounted to, uh, or we, 
we are subject to the, um, labor union's agreement, and that includes 1%, uh, of increase, uh, for 2022, which is obviously considered in our, in our numbers 
And, uh, 4% for the UK. Correct. And 4% for the UK. Yep. Sorry, that was the Spain. 
Thank you. Uh, let's, please, move on to the next question. 
Next one come from the line of Fernando Gill from Barclays. Please ask your question. 
Uh, good morning. Um, thank you for the presentations and the questions. 
Um, a question on capital and dividends. And you have declared, uh, intention to pay three cents cash dividend. 
I was wondering, uh, if there is any change for the payout policy during 2022 
given the, uh, guide that you have provided on capital to be better. 
And the second question is on, on TSB and the strategy of the asset in the group. 
Um, we still don't know, um, about a potential fine that may be coming. Do you have any, any inputs that you can share with us, uh, on that? 
And, um, yeah, that would be it. Thank you. 
Okay. So on, on dividends, 
uh, there is no guidance, uh, and there's no decision from the board, uh, for future, 
uh, besides, uh, what has been communicated today around the distribution 
over the 2021 results. 
Uh, the logic and the mood would be that, uh, logically, 
as, uh, as results, uh, continue to improve, uh, payout, uh, would, uh, should also naturally, 
uh, 
increase. Uh, but, uh, there's no more that we can say at this time because, uh, there's no formal decision from, from the board. 
In terms of the TSB fine, it's still early, uh, although we think that the movements will happen, uh, probably this, this year. Uh, 
I think there are two factors here. One is, uh, the fine, which is uncertain. 
And the other one is the recovery, uh, from the insurance, which is also uncertain. 
The way we see it is that we expect that there will be no material impact, 
uh, from that because, uh, they will tend to compensate each other. 
And the only thing that we do is we expect a timing difference 
between the potential fine, which should come earlier than the recovery, uh, from the insurance 
on the, on the matter that we are discussing. Thank you. 
Thanks a lot. Let's, please, move on to next question. 
Next question come from the line of Francisco Raquel from Elantra. Please ask your question. 
Yes. Good morning. Thank you for the presentation and the detailed guidance. 
So I wanted to ask about TSB. Um, so you have reach, um, seven, 7.7% ROT at TSB in ' 21. 
Um, obviously, this is, uh, with the help of, um, of write backs. 
So, um, overall, if you can comment on the, how do you be, uh, how, how, how did you see ROT for TSB going, going forward? On the one hand, 
the write backs, you mentioned that there is a still room for, for regional 
write backs in ' 22. You were guiding also for a 20 bips cost of risk normalized, 
but, uh, for, uh, your mortgage, uh, model line bank, maybe, maybe conservative. 
The cost base, I understood you were also mentioning that it could beat 730 million euros guidance for the cost base. 
Um, so you have some, one also in think on positive. 
Uh, um, so if you can, can, can please comment on the overall sustainability of this profitability for TSB going, going forward. 
And then also, strategically, on TSB, any, any update on your, on your views on this asset. Thank you. 
Shall I take the profitability one, 
Cezar? Yep. Sure. Okay. So, basically, for TSB, we are, we're also, uh, positive, if you wish. 
It's true that we have been able to reach these, uh, 7.7% <inaudible>, 
sorry, uh, return tangible equity in, in ' 21, which is well ahead of our initial guidance, which was north of 6% 
for 2023. 
So things are improving. 
Things have improved more than we thought. Uh, 
I think, um, with regard to the, of the management of the bank, things are going very well and also, uh, the macro is, is improving much faster and it has helped a lot, 
you know, for example, in terms of the volumes that have been, uh, done both for the market and both for TSB in 2021, which was not in our expectation. 
In any case, moving, moving forward and looking at, uh, 
2022, as I said, we are positive. We think NII should expand because of the reasons I mentioned before. So basically volumes. We're gonna grow volumes in ' 22, but also 
we are starting the year with the volumes of Q4, which were significantly higher than in Q1, you know. 
So this is gonna have to be, uh, it's gonna be, it's gonna be very, should be fairly positive 
for 2022, despite the fact that we are not considering all the full rate increases that the market is now, uh, taken into account, just 25 basic points out of the 100. 
So pretty confident on NII. 
Fees, I think we had a very good, uh, year in 2022, sorry, in 2021. So we are aiming for perhaps a flattish number in 2022, something reasonably stable. 
Costs are gonna go down in ' 22, uh, because of the execution of the restructuring plan in ' 21. So, uh, year on year, they're gonna go down, you know. 
And then cost of risk. We had no cost of risk in ' 21 because of the write backs. 
We believe that cost risk, uh, going forward, on normalized basis should be fairly low, uh, the 20 basic points that you mentioned 
<inaudible>. Uh, basically, this is, uh, uh, a mortgage mono liner. As you very well know, the, the mortgage market in the UK is very different to one in Spain. 
Uh, we're talking about mortgages that have less than two year duration because of how the mortgage, uh, evolves there. 
Uh, so basically, historically, uh, mortgages in the UK have had very, very, very little basic points, right? In terms of cost risk, I would say, less than mid single 
digit, uh, and we're expecting, we're, we are focused in ' 20, you know, because we have a little bit of consumer, uh, finance. 
So, uh, and on top of that, there is a chance that, uh, you know, there's still some provisions that were booked in 2020, and that if the macro, 
uh, has a good, uh, evolution could be released. 
But even without that, 
we are confident that return on <inaudible> equity in ' 22 should, 
should improve as per study. Cesar. 
Yeah. In terms of, uh… I mean, TSB is generating capital to fund its own growth. 
We are very satisfied, uh, with, uh, the way management and the market and the evolution of the numbers and the strategies going forward. 
And, uh, sorry for being boring, but there are no plans to engage in corporate activity. 
So, no change. Thank you. Let's, uh, please move on to the next question. 
Next question is from the line of Mario <unk> from Univest Securities, please ask your question? Hi. 
Good morning, everybody. My first question is, um, customer experience. 
Uh, we have been hearing, hearing in the industry that customer experience, uh, should tend to, to, to be stable, 
uh, but actually we're, we're still seeing pressure. So I would like to hear your comments, uh, going forward into 2022, uh, perhaps a little bit of, uh, thoughts about different segments. 
And then the second question is just, uh, uh, a detail one. If you could provide the, the percentage of eco loans that are under stage two. Thank you. 
Okay. Uh, I think we have, uh, been all along saying that, uh, customer experience are under some pressure, 
both in Spain and the UK across, uh, the different, uh, segments, both, uh, retail and, uh, commercial. 
Uh, the question is, and I think in the guidance that, uh, I mean the forward looking that we are giving, we are saying that, uh, this would be compensated, 
uh, by volume growth. 
So it's not, uh, dramatic, but we see some, uh, minor reduction in customer experience that should be offset or more than offset by, 
by volume growth. 
In terms of capital, this is also managed because we are being more efficient in the way we deploy it. So, overall, it's a positive, uh, positive outcome. 
And as per eco loans, uh, we have around 18% of the portfolio classified as, uh, stage two at the end of the year. 
Well, thanks a lot. We're starting to run short of time. So, uh, we'll give access to one more call and we'll see if we can feed, uh, get another one behind that. 
So let's please give access to the next call. 
Next question from the line of Peter Smith from Autonomous Research. Please ask your question. 
Yeah. Hi there. Good morning. Um, I've got two quick ones. 
Um, can you tell us what the macro provisions are that are left in Spain and what the expected cost of risk on the NPL inflow, um, is at, at the moment? 
And then, secondly, um, are calendar provisions included in your cost of risk outlook? 
Um, or do you expect this to potentially impact the shop or not have any impact whatsoever? 
Thanks. Sure. 
So, in terms of macro, we, we are… if we, if we consider macro, what we, um, provisioned in 2020 as per COVID, that was 650 million euros. 
We are not considering any release of these provisions in 2022. This is important to, to, um, to mention, okay? 
So our, our view of the evolution of cost of risk in 2022 is, is, if you wish, the recurrent, uh, evolution of, of cost of risk. 
So we're not foreseeing any kind of write backs of these provisions in, in 2022. 
And as per the kind provisions, we are including those in the, in the cost of risks. So we do not expect, uh, any kind of impact in capital 
and, uh, uh, of course, nor in, in, in this rep. 
Thanks a lot. That was quick <laugh>. So we'll try to squeeze one last question, please. 
Next one comes line of Carlos Cobo from Societe Generale. Please ask your question. 
Hello. Um, thank you, thank you for the presentation. And I'll be, I'll try to be quick. 
It's just about, uh, if you could, um, explain a little bit how much of your loan portfolio is now at fixed rate. 
Um, and how are you thinking about that if you're starting to, to show up that, um, to hedge the, the, the interest rate risk? 
And at the same time, on, on, on pricing, have you already started to increase the front book prices of, of fixed rate mortgages? 
Um, because inflation is, you know, um… and in some pressure there, if you are accommodating that, uh, risk in the front book as well, 
how are you thinking about that pricing policy, if you still want to promote straight mortgages as, as a way to go forward? Or you're gonna change that in the new environment? Thank you. Yeah. 
Around 80% of the new mortgages lending in, uh, in Q4 have been, uh, fixed, but the majority of the portfolio, if 
look, uh, if you look at the portfolio as a whole, 
uh, is, is variable. 
We are, uh, tending, yes, uh, to produce a more balanced, uh, uh… the market is more or less at 50 / 50 fixed and, and variable. 
And we will progressively tend to reduce our production of, 
uh, of, uh, fixed, uh, mortgage, uh, lending and balancing it with more production of, of variable. 
Also, not also from, uh, a book perspective, but also from a demand, uh, customer demand perspective, we think that's, uh, that's a trend to a more balanced composition. 
And as per the hedging that you mentioned, uh, Carlos, basically, we hedge the book through, um, our ALCO, uh, um, uh, committee, if you wish. Also, basically, we hedge it through, 
uh, the hedge of our, uh, bonds and portfolios and the hedge of our funding. 
So, of course, we take into account the evolution of the book 
and the evolution of the, whether the book is more fixed or more, uh, floating. And taking that into account, we hedge the, the balance sheet. In any case, 
we are now more hedged to increase in rates among other things, for example, because the fact, uh, um, because we sold, uh, bond portfolios. 
So because we're shorter of portfolios now, we're more hedged to, uh, increase of, of rates, you know. 
If we were to, um, uh, buy, uh, some of those port, or rebuild part of those portfolios that I mentioned before, 
we would, of course, uh, apply some hedging or leave the hedging where it is right now 
through hedges on either those bonds or, uh, the, the wholesale funding that, uh, that we produce. 
Thanks a lot. Uh, we now wrap up the Q&A session. Thank you all for your questions. As always, uh, the full IR team is available for any further question that, uh, you could have. 
Uh, once again, thank you all for joining us today. Have a good day. Thank you. Thank you very much.
