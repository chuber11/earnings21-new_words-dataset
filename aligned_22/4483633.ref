Thank you, Nicoletta. Thanks. Thank you everyone for joining us today. 
Uh, three months have passed since last time we met digitally all together. And many things have happened in our company. 
Today, I will be delighted to take you through the 2021 result and I will provide a little taste about what's happening in our company. 
Our performance in 2021 was very robust, from both a quantitative and qualitative point of view. 
Numbers first. 
We closed the year setting a new record 
in terms of result across all metrics, posting double-digit growth and above pre-pandemic level. 
The results were higher than the targets we had already upgraded when we shared our third quarter results. 
Five, five excellent result to remember. 
First, €4.3 billion revenues, materially 
exceeding, for the first time in our history, the threshold level of €4 billion. 
Over 11,000 car shipped with significant growth in our region. 
In China, our deliveries doubled year over year. 
35.9% exceptionally strong EBITDA margin reached at a record level. 
Impressive €640 million industrial free cash flow generation, 
mainly thanks to the advances collected on the special, special series and thanks to the discipline and timing of CapEx spend. 
In all this, we've no impact on our product plan. 
The last point is, we have the strongest ever order book in our history. 
Up double-digit versus the prior year in covering well into 2023 with all region, all region showing significant growth. 
How did we achieve this excellent, these five excellent result? 
Firstly, we have to thank our incredible customer, both existing and new, 
and all the women and all the men of Ferrari for their outstanding work. 
Secondly, it was possible thanks to the strong margin contribution of the Monza SP1 and SP2. 
Thirdly, this was farther boosted by our decision to seize commercial opportunities on certain models 
inline with our order intake evolution. 
We also 
benefited from deliveries of the SF90 Stradale being moved to ' 21 from previous year, 2020. 
And last but not least, we have capitalized on a strong economic climate 
as evidence also by the solid performance of our pre-owned business 
and on enthusiasm of our customer <inaudible> the light in sharing their Ferrari passion with us has been so evident at our event. 
After this five excellent result, the five key priorities, we focus on, on all the year 2021. 
Product excellence, customer experience, motor racing, brand diversification and carbon neutrality. 
Let's start with product. 
Last year, we unveiled four new models demonstrating our leadership in technology, in design, in driving experience. 
They all received an enthusiastic response from the market and worldwide acclaim. 
In May, we unveiled the 812 Competizione and the 812 Competizione 
Aperta, our latest special series with its revolutionary aerodynamics, 
and they were all sold out prior to the official launch, as a testament to the vigorous demand for our V12 models. 
Just a month later, in June, 
we launched the accelerating 296 GTB 
featuring our latest hybrid powertrain combining a V6 turbo and electric motor. 
It exceeded previous models' order intake over the same relative period and now is solid 
<inaudible> of experiences for our customer is already planned for the current year, 
farther fueling our ambition for this model. 
I drove this car several times and the, the go-kart feeling and the fun to drive experience you can have are really unique, believe me. 
A few weeks ago in November, the new Icona, 
the most powerful V12 ever made, who's unveiling I had the pleasure of attending in Florence, surprised our most loyal Ferrariste. 
I'm talking about the Ferrari Daytona SP3. 
A masterpiece of, of craftsmanship, performance and design. 
Already awarded internationally 
and limited to 599 units, which have all been allocated in advance of its premier, and we have <inaudible> demand 
way, way exceeding the limited series run. 
So we enter this year, ' 22, with considerable momentum, thanks to two factors. 
One, the strongest ever order book. And two, a broad portfolio of models. 
The order book first. It has never been so strong. 
The positive trend 
characterized the whole year and continued in Q4 when we experienced impressive order intake, despite our decision to close the order collection on certain models. 
Second, the new product portfolio. 
Not only do we have the broadest, most innovative and most beautiful range of cars ever offered to our customers, 
but we also plan to farther in reach this with two further launches this year, 
completing the 15 launches <inaudible> Capital Market Day in 2018. 
In this year, in ' 22, we will unveil the much anticipated Purosangue, which I'm confident will exceed our customer expectation. 
I drove it several times in the hills around Maranello, the day and night for the test, 
and I can testify that the driving experience is really astonishing, 
but I do not want to say more to avoid to spoil such a surprise. 
Now, after product, customer experience. 
In the course of 2021, it has been really liberating to be able to start arranging events with them again. 
To mention a few of them, we market Cavalcade's 10th anniversary. We have a very special event in Sicily for classic and modern drivers, 
and we started our <inaudible> client activities, culminating 
in the Finali Mondiali Mugello where I met <inaudible> customer and fans all passionate about Ferrari. 
Now, our motor racing activities. 
2021 was our best ever season in GT racing, 
with Ferrari winning, the drivers 
and manufacturers, world titles in FIA, world endurance championship, and with victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with our 488 GT Evo. 
The Formula One 2021 season also showed encouraging sign towards its end, 
with third place in the Constructor Championship. 
2022 is the first year with a complete new set of technical rules 
and our new car will be presented in a few days, on February 17th. 
We are also defining our strategic partner along three direction. 
One, we welcome back bank Santander. 
Two, we tap current segments with new partners such as CEVA Logistics in the transportation space. 
Three, we strengthen our relationship with leading edge technological partner such as Amazon Web Services and Velas to be at the forefront of digital technologies in Web 3.0. 
Such stronger partner portfolio 
confirms once again, the continued allure of the most successful team in F1 history, 
Scuderia Ferrari. 
And what about brand diversification? 
Well, last year we made excellent progress in extending our brand into exciting new territories. 
In June, we launched the first ever Ferrari fashion collection. 
In July, we reopened the iconic Cavallino restaurant in the heart of Maranello. 
And in the second half of last year, we renovated our stores in Italy and USA. 
In 2022, we plan to move forward 
and the first important milestone will be the upcoming fashion show in Milan later this month. 
Last but not least, carbon neutrality by 2030. 
In a farther step towards our goal in Q4, we received ISO 14064 certification for our calculation of the group's carbon footprint. 
This certification has been really an important step forward. 
In addition to our electrification journey, 
we are also committed to addressing both 
direct, 
indirect emission with a focus on energy and material across all our <inaudible> value chain. 
As always, our focus was not only on external stakeholders. 
We continued to invest in our employees, through to our founders believe that Ferrari is made, above all, by people. 
We invested in training for our employees, caring for their wellbeing and nurturing the diversity of talent in our company. 
Our efforts were rewarded in 2021 by equal salary certification 
for the second consecutive year in Italy and for the first time in the United States. 
The year has been really outstanding, thanks to the passion, the dedication of Ferrari people and to reward their achievement inline with the company's strong performance indicators. 
I'm really pleased to announce the company, the yearly competitive award, 
up to slightly over €12,000 for our employees. 
And now, after the 2021 highlight, let's have a look at the future, at our future, 
a small taste before providing the full picture on June 16 when we meet here. 
We are targeting 2022 to be a solid year on the trajectory to reach 
the 2023 EBITDA target of 1.8, €2 billion as announced in 2018. 
How do we want to do this? How do we want to achieve this goal? Well, there are three clear direction we identified. 
Number one, we will carefully manage a vibrant order intake inline with our strategy to pursue controlled growth to preserve our brand exclusivity. 
Two, we will manage the Monza's phase out while the Daytona's deliveries will start in 2023. 
Three, as I already explained in the last call, innovation requires partners and it is what we start to do. 
<inaudible>, Amazon and Velas, just to mention a few of them. 
And some others, some other important technology partnership will follow up in the near future. 
2022 is a very important year for us. It's not only the 75th anniversary of our company, 
it also sets the foundation for a new business plan 
which will be presented at our Capital Market Day on June 16 here in Maranello. 
This will also be location to meet in person, some members of our new organization, 
recently announced and achieved through both the promotion of homegrown talents and a number of key strategic externalize. 
The new organization is designed to farther further innovation, optimize processes, enhance <inaudible> and increase collaboration. 
People are the soul of our company 
and I'm confident we will seize the opportunities ahead of us in this fast evolving environment. 
I will now hand over to Antonio, who will review the 2021 result and 2022 guidance. 
Thank you, Benedetto. And good morning or afternoon to everyone who is joining us today. 
Let me start on page seven, 
where you can see the highlights of the 2021 earnings, 
a very strong year, which shows high double-digit growth on all metrics compared to 2020. 
And more meaningfully, a remarkable increase versus pre-pandemic levels. 
Our shipments reached 11,155 unit, up 22% versus the prior year, and 10% versus 2019. 
Group net revenues were €4,271,000,000, increased 
23% versus prior year, and 13% versus 2019, driven mainly by volume and stronger product mix. 
EBITDA came in at €1,500,031,000, up 
34% versus 2020, and close to 21% versus 2019. 
The EBITDA margin reached a record level of 35.9%, 
boosted by the contribution from the Ferrari Monza and, and otherwise very rich product mix. 
EBIT was €1,075,000,000, up 50% versus 2020, and 17% versus 2019. 
The improvement of both operations margins compared to our latest guidance, 
mainly reflects the upward revision of the commercial revenue from DF1 commercial rate holder recorded in Q4. 
<inaudible> net profit was 833 million, up 56% versus 2020, and 19% versus 2019, 
resulting in an adjusted diluted EPS of €4.5, improved by 56% versus prior year. 
Industrial free cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at €642,000,000, supported 
mainly by the collection of the advances for the 812 Competizione. 
Turning to page eight. You can see the details of the shipments of the full year 2021, up 22% versus 2020. 
Sales of eight-cylinder went up about 35% while 12 cylinders were down 16%, 
mainly due to the reduced volume, volume of the A12 Superfast, 
which was phase out in the year. 
Uh, deliveries were driven by the range models, the F8 family, the Ferrari Roma and the SF90 Stradale which reached global distribution. 
The Portofino M and the SF90 spider in wrap up phase. 
Shipments of the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 were higher compared to the prior year, inline with planning and reaching the end of production. 
All geographic regions posted double-digit growth. 
Moving to page nine. You can see the <inaudible> of our group net revenues, up 26% at constant currency. 
The increasing revenues from cars and spare parts, up almost 29% at constant currency, were 
supported by higher volumes and strong enrichment of the product mix, along with personalization. 
The revenues from personalizations were higher than the prior year in absolute terms, sustained by volumes. 
They were inline with historical average at around 18% in proportion to revenues from cars and spare parts. 
Engines revenues were up about 26%. 
The improvement is related to higher shipment to Maserati and to a lesser extent, to the rental of engines to other Formula One racing teams. 
The increasing sponsorship, commercial and brand up close to 13% at constant currency was 
<inaudible> to the more favorable Formula One calender and brand-related activities, 
partially offset by lower prior year ranking. 
This increase reflect also the upward revisions of the commercial revenues from Formula One that I mentioned before. 
Currency, including translation and transaction impact as well as foreign currency edges 
at the negative contribution of €80,000,000, mostly related to the US dollar and the Japanese yen this quarter. 
Moving to page 10. Let me review the change in our EBIT bridge, explained by the following <inaudible>. 
First, volume was positive for €220,000,000, reflecting the shipment increase. 
Second, mix price variance was also positive for €212,000,000, boosted by a richer product mix, 
thanks to the SF90 family and the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2, along with personalizations. 
Partially offset by the wrap up of the Ferrari Roma and the Portofino M, and the reduced contribution of the A12 Superfast. 
As already mentioned by Benedetto, the product mix in 2021 was farther boosted by our decision to seize commercial opportunities on certain models 
inline with order intake evolution. 
It also benefited from deliveries of the SF90 Stradale being moved to 2021 from 2020. 
Third, industrial <inaudible> expenses increase €65 million, mainly due to higher DNA, 
product innovation activities and Formula One expenses <inaudible> of technology related government incentives as well as startup cost. 
Forth, <inaudible> were negative by €14 million, mainly reflecting communication and marketing activities of model unveilings 
and lifestyle events, 
as well as the company's organizational development. 
Lastly, other increase, €83 million reflecting 
the more favorable Formula One calender and higher contribution from brand-related and other supporting activities, 
partially offset by the impact of the lower Formula One ranking of 2020. 
The <inaudible> net impact of currencies was negative for €77 million. 
As a result of what I just mentioned, 
EBIT reached €1,075,000,000, up 
50.2% versus the prior year, with an EBIT margin of 25.2%. 
Turning to page 11. Industrial free cash flow generation for the year was remarkable 
and equal to €642 million, sustained by the strong growth in EBITDA and the collection of advances on the 812 Competizione. 
The working capital dynamic, including the, the above mentioned advances, provisions and other receivables in payable 
was almost neutral, also due to the cadence of our capital expenditure, 
which to that €737 million. 
The capitalization ratio was approximately 39% for the year and inline with the prior year. 
Net industrial debt as off the end of the December 2021 was €297 million, compared 
to €543 million at the end of 2020. 
It's worth mentioning that excluding the dividend distribution of €152 million and 
€231 million of <inaudible> purchase, we would have been cash positive at year end. 
Let's move on page 12. Here we explain the main drivers of our guidance for 2022, 
which targets a solid growth and continues to demonstrate the EBITDA progress 
on the trajectory to reach our 2023 EBITDA target 
of 1.8 to €2 billion as announced back in 2018. 
While in 2022 our profitability will continue to expand in absolute terms, carefully leveraging our record order book, 
percentage wise the marginality will be flatten 
by a product mix which will be richer 
but not enough to offset the negative impact of the Monza phasing out and of the Daytona deliveries starting in 2023. 
More diversified by, but lower revenues from sponsorship 
and a step-up in DNA inline with the start of production of new models which will start deliveries in 2023 
or which contribute marginally in 2022. 
On the industrial free cash flow side, 
the generation will be robust, supported by the strong operating result and the collection of advances on the Daytona SP3. 
This will be partially offset by capital expenditure of approximately €800 million as we expect the lower CapEx seen in 2021 to <inaudible> partly in 2022. 
But also by much higher taxes <inaudible> to the very strong result posted in 2021. 
Page 10, 12. 
We show the progress that we aim to achieve based on our guidance since our starting point of 2018 until the end of 2022. 
In essence, as of the end of this current year, we want to be very close to what we promised at the 2018 Capital Market Day for the accumulated EBITDA, 
and fully on target in terms of cumulated industrial free cash flow generation over the planned period, albeit with a different time profile. 
And we want to achieve such result despite the impact of this pandemic. 
Subject to meeting our ambitions, I believe this will prove once again the resilience and strength of our business model based on brand exclusivity, product excellence, leading edge technology and innovation. 
Such awareness allow us to look at the future with great confidence. 
With that said, I turn the call over to Nicoletta. Thank you. 
Thank you, Antonio. Nadia, please, we are now ready to start our Q&A session. 
Thank you. The participants, we will now begin our question and answer session. As a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone keypad and wait for your name to be announced. 
The first question comes from line of Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the details today and for taking our questions. Um, I guess 
I'm trying to think about the, the structure of the guidance you laid out for ' 22 relevant to where with were at. Um, 
I know you guys have been focusing us on the, on the 2018 Analyst Day and helping explain the differences and similarities as you pushed up to 1.8 to 2.0 billion to next year, 
but this year you've got revenues inline at 4.8 with the, the low end of that original plan, but EBIT, 
um, below by maybe a 100 million at the low end of the plan. Maybe you could just help us understand what's different on the same revenue base that, that drives EBIT a little bit lower, 
um, this year, and if it's… And 
I think you, you originally said maybe a few units of Purosangue would, would start to ship in 2022. Today, you clarified that that will be in 2023. So maybe it's a tiny mismatch, 
but I wonder, 
um, how much of it might be, uh, attributable to the profitability of Purosangue relative to the, to the overall fleet? 
Is that… Is that a car that you view as accretive to, to corporate margins or to the rest of the fleet? 
Antonio, can you help me with it? 
Thank you, Michael. If I get your question right, 
I think the difference compared to the guidance we gave back in 2018 
is largely due to the different timing of introduction of, of the cars compared to what we modeled at that time. 
Obviously, we are seizing the commercial opportunities we are having. So, uh, the significantly strong order books on, on V8 and remodel is resulting in that respect, 
while as we mentioned, I think the, the gap that we have between the phase out of the, 
of the Monza and introduction of the Daytona is, is impacting the, the level of the, the margins, both EBIT and EBITDA. 
In addition to that, as far as EBIT is concerned, we have this DNA impact, which is the, the fact that we start producing 
new cars that are coming in, in the next one. 
I don't know whether this is enough or… I think in terms of <inaudible>, this should help. 
Um, let me follow that for one second. You have the Daytona and Purosangue confirmed to start shipping next year after what you described as a, as a headwind from mix this year, largely Monza, 
but if the guide is now 1.8 to 2 billion for next year, 
the low end of that guide assumes EBITDA growth will slow to about 6% in 2023 from 11% in 2022. 
How should we think about the top end versus the bottom end of the guidance in that range? 
What, what scenario do you see that would explain a slowdown to the, to an EBITDA growth next year? 
Maybe, maybe there's some phasing of, of investments as you guys look out to big, 
big initiatives like electric and those kinds of things. I'm just curious if you could help us think about that? Yeah. 
I think volumes will keep on growing anyway with better margins with <inaudible> be stronger, which is supported by, by the new Icona coming in. 
Um, and this isn't the… As far as the contribution of our core business and then we added the other businesses that we expect also to grow. 
I mean, brand is still very low in 2022, we expect it to be better. 
Um, in terms of one, there are some elements that, including the budget cap introduction to debts, of course, in terms of the cost side. 
Okay. Thanks. And congrats on a, on a great year, guys. I appreciate it. 
Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. 
Uh, thanks very much. And I cannot wait until June 16th. That's gonna be really… That's gonna be so special. So I look forward to meeting you all in person. Um, 
Benedetto, uh, when you… You guys recently struck a deal with the Swiss blockchain, uh, company, Velas Network. 
Uh, how should investors think about the potential for the Ferrari brand 
in the Metaverse, uh, or in the NFT or digital space? 
Thank you for the question, uh, Jonas, and also looking forward to meet you in person on the 16th of June. 
I, 
I think that as we said, you know, it is important that we look and we see how the new technologies can help the, our brand. 
For sure, 
the digital technologies, the Web 3.0 technologies that are using the, the blockchain and the NFT is an area that is, can be interesting for us, 
it deserves some attention. 
There are many, as you know, there are many, there is a lot of movement on the market about this. Some companies even changed the name 
and I think this is an area that, where we have to put our attention and that's the reason also why I put the, um… 
We have in place, if you've seen in the organization, I don't know, a department that is called digital and data, 
because, I mean, it's an important dimension that we as Ferrari, we have, uh, we have to evaluate to consider for the future. 
Okay. Uh, look forward to learning more about that, 
uh, Benedetto. Um, my follow up is, do you believe electric vehicles expands the addressable market for the Ferrari brand 
and if so, how? 
So do you think that the electric vehicles will expand the brand? 
Do you think that as Ferrari brings forth all electric vehicles, that that grows the addressable market and revenue potential for the brand? 
And if so, how do you see that happening or why? Okay. Uh, 
I think the, the point is the following. 
I mean, electrification is one, 
one technology like the digitalization that we will harness always in our unique 
Ferrari way. 
As you know, we already started to hybridize our model a few years ago. We have already three model on the road 
that are pretty much successful, SF90 Stradale, Spider and 296 GTB. 
And I believe that the, the electrification is a way, 
is a technology in a way that can help our brand to keep the pace with the time. 
That's what I believe, uh, Adam. Okay. Thanks, Benedetto. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Susy Tibaldi from UBS. Please ask your question. 
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Um, so my first one would be, um, just to go back on Michael's question on the, the ' 22 guide. 
Um, so your revenue, uh, guide for 2022, um, is, is quite high, 
um, and so, given that the mix is going to be not that strong, 
it kind of implies, uh, a good step up in volume. 
Um, and so, I was wondering if this is a correct assumption or if there is something else that will contribute meaningfully to the top-line? 
Because you mentioned that also in terms of, uh, some sponsorship is a little bit lower. 
So it seems like this good increase in revenues should come mostly from the, from the, from the volume growth? 
So I just wanted to check if that's, uh, the right way to think about it? 
Um, hi, Susy, Antonio speaking. 
Your assumption is correct. Volume will be higher, so we'll grow there. 
And this is because also, the order book is significantly higher than we're used to, and it's covering well into 2023. 
Um, it's not true that the, the mix is weak. I mean, actually the, the, the product range mix is high. 
It's simply not enough improving compared to the loss of the, 
of the Monza and the introduction some, some months later of the Daytona. 
Okay. But basically year-over-year volumes will be positive and mix we expect to be, um, slightly negative 
overall. Okay. Okay. Got it. Um, and on pricing, 
um, so in ' 21, it was the first time that you, you pushed through a like for like price increase, about 2%. 
Um, if I remember correctly, was mostly due to the inflation, to the inflation. 
Um, and given that the inflation for the moment is not really going away, um, should we expect something similar for ' 22? Like, are you planning to, uh, potentially push through some 
price increase if, you know, to offset the inflation or was it a one-off in ' 21? Yeah. 
This is an important point. I mean, uh, there is some pressure on the energy, on the aluminum cost and we will, uh, and we will apply this price increase to consider for that, 
but we will also leverage, uh, other important levers when it comes to the pricing of the new model 
and selected, I mean, the price increase of selected model and also the personalization. 
So this is an important factor we are factoring in, uh, 
Susy. Okay. Very clear. And very quick, just to follow up on your 
free cash flow, uh, that you… 
So in the slide that you showed you basically, you're in line, you achieved the, the 2.4 to 2.8 cumulative, uh, cash flow as promised. So, um… 
So basically the fact that, um, you were guiding previously to 1.1 billion to 1.25 billion industrial free cash flow, 
is just a matter of phasing, right? Because it feels like, um, that has been just phased differently due to the, to the phasing of the models. 
Yeah. Or was there some kind of advances for a future maybe hypercar, which now been change in timing? Um. No. 
You got it right, Susy. Uh, phasing is exact answer. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot. Welcome. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please ask your question. Hi. 
Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for the time. 
Um, just wanted to follow up on, on that pricing discussion. I mean, obviously, there's cost inflation that's going on, 
but you're talking about your order book, um, being longer than it ever has been before. 
So is there a greater opportunity to, you know, take price, explain it to your, your customers if there's cost inflation to you, um, they are relatively sophisticated to offset that, 
but then also to maybe, you know, help balance out the supply and demand, um, in the business? 
It's a very high-class problem, but it seems like there might be a greater pricing opportunity, um, than you've ever even had before. 
Thank you. I think this is, what you say, it's important and, uh, we are considering, uh, uh… I mean, we, we, we are applying the price increase 
and we are monitoring carefully what's happening on these two dimensions of energy and aluminum. And again, as I said, 
we will introduce also new model and <inaudible> we will apply in the right way the pricing. 
So this is, uh, an important dimension that we are, uh, we are, we are careful about, also because, 
uh, we all know what is the pressure that there is in the supply chain all over the world. 
On the other side, I have to say that we have also, uh, on the supply chain, 
I mean, we have some good partners, reliable partner we can leverage on. 
Okay. And maybe just a second question on the transition to, to EVs. 
Um, you know, it's very interesting that Daytona is a V12, uh, naturally aspirated, um, engine. Um, you know, that sounds great to me, personally. 
Um, but you know, obviously there's a push towards, towards EVs. 
Um, given your, your close relationship with your, your customers and, and you kind of build, you design, engineer and build what they want, 
what are you hearing from your customers at this point on this transition? 
I mean, many other companies are, you know, slaves to guessing at where EV penetration will go and what they should do with their powertrain investment, 
but you have direct access and good discussion and relationships with your customers. So what are they telling you? 
Because on the Daytona it seems like they're saying, Hey. We probably don't want this right now. But, um, the reality is, some people might. So I mean, what are your customers telling you right now? 
I think we have, uh, 
uh, I mean, we have different kind of Ferrariste, 
each one with its own, uh, preferred, uh, let's say model and propulsion. So we have a Ferrariste that, uh, I have seen them 
in Florence when, uh, we launched the, the Daytona, 
and they were extremely, extremely happy and delighted to see such a beautiful car. 
I have seen also customer trying the, the 296 GTB. That is a kind of different, uh, different car with different feeling. 
So I think that, uh, if you want to get my, uh, feedback from the customer, is that we have customer 
with different, uh, feeling, different needs, different perceptions. 
And, uh, even the same customer for different moment can have, can prefer the, the V12, the aspirated 
one, or the V6 hybrid. 
So there is a mix of different, uh, customer with different feelings and different need, different emotion. 
But it's fair to say that you're not guessing at this? You're, you're having these discussions with your customers. So your, your… So what you're introducing and you're building 
is what they want. You're, you're never gonna go you, you misestimated the EV penetration on, on your, on the models, right? I mean, 
this is something that's well known by, by you through that order book and your discussions with your customers. Is that a fair statement? No. 
I'm saying that there is a clear trend and we will work on, uh, for sure, on electric vehicle and we will see the strategy line up, uh, here in June 16. 
What I want to say is that there are customers, different customer that prefer different kind of, uh, propulsion scheme. 
So we are aware obviously of what's happening, we have planned for that, 
but we are also aware of the different feelings and different emotion the customer want to get with different propulsion scheme. 
Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Giulio Pescatore from BNP Paribas Exane. Please ask your question. Hi. 
Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on, on the previous point. 
Um, in your answer, did you mean that as long as customer will want combustion engines, you would be willing to provide them, even if we think about 10 or 20 years down the line? 
I think that, uh, the technology is useful as far as it address the customer, uh, needs. 
We have to delight the customer. We have to… I mean, this is, this is important for us. 
So if, uh, we are moving piston or we are, um, moving other, other things, that's what we want to, to do. 
Okay. thank you. And then the second question on the order book for the 296 GTB, which you said builds faster than, than the previous processor of that vehicle. 
Um, does that mean that that car could potentially do the same type of volumes that, uh, <inaudible> attribute <inaudible> as they did in the past? 
And can you maybe talk about the difference in demographics between that vehicle and, and the 488? 
Maybe I, I go? Yeah. You can go, Antonio. I think you have <crosstalk>. <crosstalk> the forecast on, on volume lifecycle. 
However, as, as Benedetto said before, uh, the <inaudible> has been very strong in terms of order compared to our previous internal benchmarks. 
The other element, yes, I think you are addressing the fact that the, our customer base for this car is slightly younger and this is, it is true. 
I mean, really, you need to drive it to experience it. It's- Oh, <inaudible> you to provide a driving experience that <inaudible>, 
I'll be more than happy to. Yeah. We will. 
<crosstalk>. We will. The car is here. Fantastic, great to hear. 
I'll get there. Um, maybe just one last one before I, I pass on to the, to the next speaker. 
On the free cash flow for 2022, um, I really started to, to bridge your guidance, which feels very, very conservative at the lower end at least. 
I understand the step-up in CapEx. I understand, um, that there are going to be higher taxes, but, um, can you maybe help us, help us with the amount of deposits 
that we should expect, 
um, from, from the Daytona and, uh, how many 
deposits did you receive last year for the Competizione? Because it's really difficult to bridge the two numbers. Well, um, 
I have not comment on the degree of conservatives of the 
estimate, but basically our cash flow is really simple. I mean, we have the EBITDA and you know what the guidance is. 
You know what we said about CapEx. 
I think your question is about the working capital, where we include in the wider definition also the impact of the advances 
on the limited series cars. 
Uh, so the Daytona, we are talking about more than 200 million more or less in, in terms of current estimate. 
The other element you should not underestimate is the impact of taxes, 
because we are obviously paying taxes both in terms of the balance and the advance on the basis of the results of 2021. 
Uh, and it makes a big difference compared to what we paid in 2021 based on the results of 2020 that were impacted by, by the pandemic. 
Hope this provides you, uh, a better understanding of the detail. Yeah. 
You're still benefiting from the button box, right? 
The button box is helping, but not in terms of cash, nor the level it did at the very beginning, because now the, the law provides for the benefit cash-wise 
in three install- in three-year installments. 
So this has been already visible in 2021, and it will be obviously in 2022. Okay. 
Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Martino De Ambroggi from Equita. Please ask your question. 
Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Uh, my focus is on CapEx, uh, which is a portion of the lower free cash flow for the current year. 
So the 800 million may be considered a sort of peak for CapEx or should we expect they will go beyond 1 billion annually 
going forward? 
Uh, and when you talk about, uh, partnerships, uh, I remember you also mentioned partnership in order to reduce CapEx. 
I clearly understand you cannot talk about something that was not announced, but, uh, just to elaborate a bit on, on this in order to understand what 
could be the magnitude of the reduction in CapEx, if any? 
Thank you. Thank you, Marco. Uh, you remember well. The partnerships are an important way forward for us. 
And as I said also before, uh, there would be some, uh, partnership that, uh, is an important partnership for us, we will announce in the near future. I, 
I think that, 
um, I mean, it's important… That is always also what I said in my previous life, to keep strong discipline about CapEx 
and to keep the momentum and to, to make sure to do something innovative. 
It's, it's important we decide what we do internally and we decided, and what we want to do with partners outside. 
So the two word are partnership and discipline. 
And, uh, as I said, in, in the near future you will hear about an important partnership on something that is important 
for, for our car, but for which, 
let's say, we believe the, the best way forward is, is partnership. 
And on the amount of CapEx, uh, 800 million could be considered as a peak? 
You, you can consider it is more or less a, a good number to think about, 
because we will use, as I said, the, the partnership to, to optimize and to be disciplined. 
Okay. Thank you. And, uh, talking about volumes, 
uh, based on what you commented before, 
I would expect, uh, higher volume growth than the usual, let's say, average 6% we saw in the last few years? 
<crosstalk>. Yes. It is a better result of the significant net order intake increase that we have seen this year. 
So we need to serve this one. Obviously, we'll be very careful, because the concept of <inaudible> remains crucial to our business model, 
and this is an element of, of significant attention. We'll play all, all leverages to, to manage this one. 
And for sure, the broadest portfolio, the broad portfolio we have is helping, uh, to protect also the brand exclusivity, because in this year 
we have a lot of, uh, a lot of model that are in production. Thank you. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stephen Reitman from Societe Generale. 
Please ask your question. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for this. Um, 
I understand what you're saying about the mix in 2022. So just <inaudible> dig a little more detail in that. 
First of all, um, it my understanding that you'll still be selling some Monzas in the first quarter of 2022. 
So we could see maybe some 
impact there. And my second question is about the <inaudible> deliveries of the 812 Competizione. Um, how 
many would you expect to be delivered in 20… You are having… There is a lot of noise on the background. We are having trouble to understand your question. I don't know. It seems there is, uh, someone unmuted. I don't know. 
I'll try again. Sorry. Okay. I'll try again maybe. Sorry about that. Um, yeah, I'm sorry, no. 
I just wanted to ask, so first of all, um, I understand that you will be selling still 
some Monzas in the first quarter of this year, this final model. 
Will that have an impact expected in the first quarter of this year still? 
And secondly, could you talk about the cadence of deliveries of the 812 Competizione, obviously a very high-margin car for you, in the quarter of 2022? Thank you. Hi, Stephen. 
I think in terms of the Monza, we'll complete the deliveries of the, of the Monza in Q1. 
However, then the absolute number will not be, uh, as high as it has been during the last quarter of this year. 
And the 812 Competizione and Competizione Aperta will be spread quite evenly, uh, across the fourth quarter. 
Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of George Galliers from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. 
Thank you for taking my question. Yeah. The, the first question I had was, um, just on the volumes. Obviously, you're now above 11,000 units. 
I think in the past, uh, previous management mentioned that max capacity was about 15,000 units on the existing industrial footprint. 
Is, is that still roughly the right number to think about? And in order to get there, presumably you'd have to add shifts. 
What's the kind of lead time from a trading perspective to add incremental shifts? 
The second question I had was with respect to the carbon neutrality by 2030. 
Do you still expect e-fuels to play a prominent role in reaching that target? 
And then finally, obviously we had significant management changes and some exciting promotions and external hires during the quarter, 
um, perhaps you could give some insights into the skill sets you were looking to promote as part of those management changes. Thank you. 
Thank you. I'll start from the last one, the management change and the carbon neutrality, and the first one, uh, Antonio will take it. So let's start from the management change. 
Yes, uh, we did a big change at the beginning, end of last year, beginning of this change, beginning of this year. 
And, uh, we did along two direction, if you have seen. 
On one side, we promoted our internal talents that I had the, the pleasure to see, because I talked to a lot of people in the company, 
and those will externalize. 
I think, uh, what the common thread, uh, that we wanted and I wanted to push within this new organization 
are, uh, the four, the four following ones. 
Number one, the strong willingness to cooperate. 
Number two is about, uh, attention to innovation. And number three is the focus to bring these things, 
uh, especially in a transition area 
to make the right, the right choice, the right decision with right timing 
and to move forward. 
And number, number four is, uh, is very important, especially nowadays, this is becoming very important for all the companies, is this continuous learning approach, 
because we have, uh, to, to be open to listen at the other point of view, other people point of view and also the supplier point of view, the partner point of view. 
So these are, uh, 
the features that I want to boost with the, uh, the new organization. Again, organized with homegrown talents and also external hires. 
This keeps for granted, let me say, competencies that are all these people are bringing, uh, in, in the game. 
Coming to the second question, the carbon neutrality. 
As we said, the carbon neutrality, uh, we, we will show you a clear plan in, when we meet here in Maranello. The target is to become carbon neutral by 2030. 
We want to do it looking at, uh, all the carbon emission we generate directly as well as the carbon emission that, uh, gets generated along, 
uh, the value chain. 
And, uh, we want to do in a scientific way, scientific way. 
And so, that's the reason why we are also proud, if you want, of this ISO certification we got in Q4, 
because it, it testifies that we are, uh, substantiating these numbers with scientific approach. 
I think that if we want to tackle this properly, we need it to be, 
to, to do it scientifically and that's what we will do, and that's what we will show you in, in June. 
Now the, the, the first question, Antonio, you can take it. Yeah, George. 
On the first one, yes, 15,000 units is the, is level of capacity that we have. There has been no change in that respect. 
And the second one, we are working on to shift and we predict to be there even for 2022. 
Hope this helps. Great. Thank you. Yeah. Very helpful. Thank you very much and looking forward to the CMD. Likewise. 
Thank you. 
The next question comes from the line of Monica Bosio from Intesa Sanpaolo. Please ask your question. Uh, good afternoon, everyone. I hope you can hear me. Um, my first question is on the volume growth in 2022 on the back of the strong order books, 
the ramp-up of the new <inaudible> model seen in 2022. The volume, volumes impact would be significant over the current year. 
I was wondering if these could bring to some phase out of some models such as the S8. 
And, uh, as for the price mix, uh, uh, 
I was wondering if you can elaborate, uh, on what do you expect in term of personalization for 2022? 
And, uh, my second question, uh, is, are housekeeping questions. 
Uh, as for the advances, uh, from the Daytona, should we assume an impact mostly in the first part of the year, is it correct? 
And, uh, in term of, uh, 
taxes, you mentioned that the taxes will be higher at the cash impact level in 2022. 
Can you give us some highlights at the P&L level? Thank you very much. 
I'll take the part of the, the phase out of the model. As I said, in, in Q4, we stopped the… 
We did not take order anymore on some, uh, some model, 
and this is done for the sake of brand exclusivity. 
Uh, the personalization, uh, gives, uh, a good contribution to our, um, to our top line. 
And, uh, for the Daytona, the taxes may be… Antonio, you can take it. Sure. 
Thank you <crosstalk>. The <inaudible> Daytona is significantly contributing in terms of cash flow with the advances in Q1. Maybe you'll remember what happened back in 2019 with the, with the Monza. 
Um, and in terms of taxes, yes, we are currently projecting something like, uh, approximately 200 million additional cash out for taxes during the course of 2022. 200 million. 
Thank you very much. Yeah. Welcome. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. Dear participants, thank you very much for all your questions and now I would like to hand the conference over to our main speaker today, Mr. Benedetto Vigna, for closing remarks. 
Thank you so much. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you so much. And thanks all, uh, for your time this afternoon and also for all your, uh, your questions. 
Let me close by underscoring three things. 
One, uh, our excellent 2021 financial result with an exceptional EBITDA margin. 
Two, our record order book covering well into 2023. 
And three, our broad innovative and beautiful product range with two new launches to come in this year, in 2022. 
Today, I realize, I mean, we provided a little taste of what's happening in our company. 
I realize that you want to hear more and we are as eager as ever to seize these opportunities ahead of us and to share 
with all of you the full picture on June 16 in Maranello at Capital Market Day. 
So good afternoon, everyone. Thanks again for your attention and talk you in the next quarter. Thank you. 
That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a nice day.
