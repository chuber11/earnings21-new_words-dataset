These statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to defer materially from those described in any overlooking statement. 
With that, uh, I now leave the hand to, uh, CE- our CEO Ester Baiget. Ester please. 
Thank you Tobias and thank, excuse me, and thank you all for calling in. Please, uh, turn into slide, uh, number two. 
I'm very pleased with our performance in 2021, 
we delivered a strong sales earnings and non-financial numbers and advance our business in accordance with our a refreshed strategy, unlocking growth powered by biotech 
that we launched last September. 
Organic sales grew 6% and benefiting from our diversified portfolio. 
Performance was particularly strong in food, beverages and human health, in bio energy and in grain and tech processing, 
all three business areas delivered strong double digit growth. 
Household care declines likely and agricultural and animal health and nutrition was flat. 
And when both, uh, business areas were soft, they were roughly in line with our latest expectations for the full year. 
Over the past couple of years we have invested in our commercial activities, especially in emerging markets. 
And it's very, very encouraging to see the sales here growing by an impressive 18%. 
Sales in the developed markets also grew, although at a more moderate rate. 
Sustainability, it's part of our DNA here at Novozymes. And I'm very pleased to say that we are on track to meet 12 of our 30 non-financial targets. 
While the, the targets are for 2022, we actually exceeded several of them already in 2021. 
The benefits to the world from the use of our products are something we are all very proud of, 
and we embrace the responsibility to be at the forefront of the movement for a healthier planet, as a company with a strong purpose. 
We are committed to support the transition towards a climate natural 
society, and in 2021, 
77% of our revenue was generated from products that contribute to lowering CO2 emissions by reducing the use of fossil based resources, and by reducing waste. 
Another key to achieve a more sustainable world, is to transform food systems. 
In 2021 35% of our revenue came from products enabling our food production systems to produce more food from less and improve nutrition and quality. 
Additionally, we strongly committed to enabling healthy lives, 
and 5% of our full year revenue came from products that enable a better health for people around the world. 
From an innovation perspective, 2021 was another strong year with the launch of market leading products, such as Pristine, 
which is the broad market freshener solution and prag 360, which improved digestibility of proteins for animals. In total, we launched 14 products during 
2021, including six in the fourth quarter of alone. 
This is much in line with previous years. 
Turning, uh, to our financials, we delivered a strong EBT margin and ROIC including goodwill as well as a strong free cash flow. 
And while reinvesting significantly in commercial activities, 
making, uh, several acquisitions and increasingly experience the head ones from higher input costs towards the end of the year. 
Executing on our strategy has been our number one priority in 2021, 
after acquiring Micrim Labs and the Biota Technology asset in the first quarter, we took another important step to advance our bio health business in the fourth quarter with the acquisition of Synergy Life Science. 
Synergy is a leading developer and manufacturing for sport probiotics and natural vitamin in 
K27, and it will play a key role for us in expanding our opposition in human health and also in functional foods. 
Also in the fourth quarter, we enter into a very exciting collaboration with Saipem on enzymatic carbon capture 
and continue the construction of the new state of the art production for advanced protein solutions in Blair, Nebraska in the US. 
The steps we have taken during the last couple of years, sets us up to deliver another good year in 2022. 
And we expect to be off to a good start for the year. 
In 2022, we expect sales to grow by 3 to 7% organically. With growth across all business areas, 
sales in Danish kroner is expected to be around three percentage points higher. 
The EBIT margin is expected at a solid 25 to 26 despite significant pressure from higher input costs. 
And lastly, we expect ROIC including goodwill to end between 16 and 17% 
while the free cash flow before acquisitions is expected between 1.7 to 2.1 billion Danny Kroner, 
including a significant uptick in CapEx, mainly driven by the new production line in, in Blair. 
With that overview, let's now look at each of the five business areas in more detail. And, uh, starting with household care. 
Could you please turn, uh, to slide number three. Thank you. 
Household care decline org- uh, by 1% organically in 2021, 
the so full year performance came against a strong performance in 2020. 
Emerging markets performed well supported by investments to expand our commercial footprint and tailor solutions resulting in an increased enzymatic penetration. 
Our sales developed, in developed markets declined as European consumer, uh, demand was significantly lower than expected. 
Performers further worsened in the second half of the year, where also two mid-sized private label players went out of businesses. 
The freshness technology performed well and in line with expectations, 
it was made available across multiple countries in Europe and the broad market solution was successfully launched in the third quarter. 
Sales in the fourth quarter declined 3% organically, 
similar to the full year performance emerging markets performed well while Europe in particular, continue to decline, decline for the same reasons as mentioned, uh, for the full year. 
While the 1% decline in 2021 was not satisfactory, 
an average annual growth of a rate of 2% over the past two years is a meaningful step in the right direction. 
Looking ahead, we expect sales in household care to grow by two to 4% in 2022. 
Growth is expected to be driven by increased market penetration in emerging markets, 
by freshness, as well as in the non laundry areas of professional and medical cleaning and in dish wash. 
As mentioned, we launched the broad market version of freshness technology in 2021. 
This was a significant milestone and freshness is expected to increasingly contribute to growth as the year progress as well as in the years to come. 
Could you please turn into slide number four? Thank you. 
Our food beverages and human health businesses had an excellent year 
and the team has done a terrific job in executing on the strategic direction while also capitalizing on the supportive market conditions. 
Sales grew 14% organically in 2021, with all three main categories growing by double digits. 
Growth in food was mainly driven by market penetration, 
and demand was particularly strong for health focused solution, such as acrylamide reduction in baking, sugar reduction in dairy and solution for plant-based protein extraction. 
In addition, bene- baking benefited to some extent from raw optimization and ingredient substitution. 
Beverages perform well and outgrew the underlying market while also benefiting from a recovery in global beer volumes. 
Growth in human health was very strong and driven by cross-selling and geographical expansion. 
In the fourth quarter, sales grew 13% organically. The performance was led by food, bev- uh, by food. 
Beverages grew slightly and was, uh, somehow impacted by the stocking, where, uh, hum- whereas human health performed well and according to the expectations. 
Also, in the fourth quarter, we strength, uh, and accelerated our Bio Health business by acquiring a majority stake in Synergia Life Science and as I've already mentioned. 
Let me now turn, uh, to the outlook, 
in 2022, we expect organic sales in food beverages and human health to grow by high single digit rate, with all soup areas contributing to growth. 
Growth in food will be driven by market penetration, supported by health focused solutions and raw material optimization and ingredient substitution. 
For beverages, we expect, uh, growth on top of the double digit growth in 2021. 
And for human health, we expect continued solid double digit growth driven by innovation, cross-selling and regional expansion. 
Please turn into slide number five. Thank you. 
Full year sales in bio energy grew 11% organically. 
The strong performance was driven by the recovery of US ethanol production, growth from innovation, capacity expansion of corn based ethanol production in Latin America 
and market penetration with enzymatic solutions for bio diesel 
production, putting the US development a bit into context. 
It's important to remember that US gasoline demand and ethanol production was severely disrupted during 2020. 
US ethanol production rates gradually recovered during 2021, but still remain lower than the 2019 pre COVID level. 
Organic sales in the fourth quarter grew 10%, driven by the same factors as already mentioned for the full year performance. 
Additionally, sales benefit from growth market conditions for ethanol producers with some of the biggest crash margins in almost a decade. 
For 2022, we expect sales to grow by low to mill single digits. 
And as in 2021, growth continues to be driven by the recovery of US ethanol production, innovation capacity, expansion in Latin America, 
as well as market penetration in bio diesel. 
And as a final note, the past two years have been unusually volatile for the ethanol industry and uncertainties related to the pandemic and volatile market conditions are still present. 
This is also why bio energy com- covers a relatively broad range, uh, wine. Um, bro- broadly gro- growth range. 
Please, uh, turn into slide number six, thank you. Grain and non tech processing, uh, sales grew 13% organically in 2021. 
Sales in both grain and in tech grew by double digits with strong performance across soup areas. 
The growth in, the growth in grain was led by market penetration with solutions for vegetable oil processing, 
innovation in starch, particularly in grain milling as well as an increased and market demand for starch delivered products, especially in emerging markets. 
Tech grew primarily due to the recovering sales in textile following the negative COVID 19 impact in 2020. 
Good performance in areas such pulp and paper, leather and diagnostic enzymes for the pharmaceutical industry. 
They also contributed to the full year performance. Four quarter sales group by 15% organically. 
The performance was also broad base in the quarter with, uh, growth being fueled by innovation and high end market demand in starch delivered products. 
Market penetration in vegetable oil processing, uh, and sales of diagnostic enzymes for pharma. 
Looking at 2022, the, the development is expected to be more moderate compared to 
2021, and thus we expect the sales performance to range from flat to low single digit growth. 
Growth will be led by continued market penetration in vegetable oil processing and from innovation in starch, such as for grain milling. 
Similar to the situation in bio energy, the relatively large uncertainty related to the pandemic and the volatile market conditions are affecting the way we see prospects for grain and tech processing, 
hence we have applied a relatively broad sales range for this business area as well. 
Could you please turn, uh, to slide number seven. 
Organic sales in agricultural and animal, uh, he- health and nutrition ended the year flat 
despite a negative, uh, base effect from 60,000,000 one off in the second quarter of 2020 related to the former biarch setup. 
Sales in animal health and nutrition grew primarily from increased market penetration, driven by inoventions, such balancials and Prag 360. 
Sales in agricultural decline into the afforded base effect and increase if adjusted to it. 
The adjusted performance was driven by market penetration led by Latin America. 
Four quarter sales grew 7% organically. Growth was the strongest in animal health and nutrition with increased demand for both protein and health solutions. 
Sales in agricultural also grew driven by higher demand for bio yield solutions. 
In 2022, we expect organic sales in agricultural, animal health in addition to grow in the high single digits to glow teams. 
Growth will be led by agricultural, which is expected to grow at double digit rate, 
good market conditions and beneficial substan- uh, sustainability pull is expected to benefit a higher usage of OncoLens. 
This combined with innovation and a refined go to market model will enable increased market penetration of both bio yield and bio control solutions. 
Animal health penetration sales are also expected to grow 
fueled mainly by innovation and market driven volume growth supported by favorable market conditions. 
And with that a land over to Lars for a review of the financials. Lars please. 
Thank you Esther. Let me start by reviewing the performance of our sustainability and non-financial targets. 
Please turn to slide number eight. 
With our refreshed strategy, unlocking growth powered by biotech, we made new long-term commitments to accelerate towards a climate neutral 
society, transform food systems and enable healthier lives. 
We also significantly raised the bar by including scope three emissions in addition to scope one and two in our CO2 sa-… emissions in addition to scope one and two in our CO2 savings target for 2030. 
The 2022 non-financial targets from 2019 are still valid and serve as milestones on our long term journey. 
And it's encouraging to see that we are on track to meet 12 out of the 13 targets we defined by in 2019. 
As the non-financial targets are coming to an end here in 2022, 
we are also committing to communicate the progress and milestones we have, we have towards our long term targets for 2030 and 2050. 
You'll hear more about this during the year. 
Now, please turn to slide number nine for a review of our financial performance. 
The performance in 2021 was highly satisfactory meeting or exceeding all targets, uh, set out at the beginning of the year. 
In addition, we successfully integrated two companies, acquired a third, and launched our strategy, unlocking growth powered by biotech. 
Sales grew 6% organically, and 7% in reported Danish kroner and included a 2% point contribution from M&A, 
and roughly a 1% point headwind from currencies. 
Sales in the fourth quarter grew 7% organically and 11% in Danish kroner. 
The cross margin was strong at 57.7%, 170 basis points higher than the cross margin in 2020. 
While many companies experienced the impact from higher input costs already in 2021, 
Novozymes's unique productivity improvements and production excellence, including our leverage, allows for some alleviation of such changes in input costs. 
However, we are not immune to the significantly higher input cost, and we started to see a growing impact in the fourth quarter when the gross margin came in at 56.1%. 
This was 60 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2020, but around 200 basis points lower than for the first nine months of 2021. 
We saw the same beneficial operational factors throughout the year, with the addition of a supportive prime mix, price mix, and M&A contribution. 
The first quarter year-on-year cross margin development was driven by the same factors as for the full year, with input costs becoming a stronger headwind in the quarter. 
The EBIT margin was solid at 26.8% in line with expectations, and 70 basis points higher than in 2020. 
Higher operating costs were more than offset by higher gross profits and an increase in other operating income. 
As implied by the 27% full year outlook, 
the fourth quarter EBIT margin was expected to be soft, and the year-on-year decline was primarily due to increased operating costs, which offset the improved cost margin. 
The first quarter increase in operating costs was as expected, mainly due to higher sales and distribution spend, one off transaction costs, and the recognition of acquisitions. 
Currencies provided a slight headwind for the full year, but were marginally supportive in the fourth quarter. 
When adjusting for one-offs, the underlying full year EBIT margin for 2021 was around 27%, and roughly on par with the underlying EBIT margin for 2020. 
Further, when comparing year-on-year margins, 2021 included close to a 1% point headwind from M&A and currencies compared to 2020. 
In the fourth quarter, the underlying EBIT margin, when adjusted for both the transaction costs related to the acquisition of Synergia Life Sciences 
and the sale of a non-core building in Switzerland, was around 22% compared to the 21% reported. 
Additionally, the fourth quarter included high operational costs as expected, and included in the outlook of around 27% for the full year. 
Net investments totaled 1.1 billion Danish kroner somewhat below expectations, mainly due to timing in the fourth quarter. 
Free cashflow before acquisitions was solid at 2.9 billion Danish kroner. 
Working capital changes and increased net investments offset higher net profit and improved earnings quality. 
The lower year-on-year cash flow was much as expected following the, the 2020 BioAg one 
off, and the previously highlighted timing effects that had a positive effect on working capital in 2020. 
The first quarter free cash was 200 million Danish kroner and roughly in line with expectations following higher networking capital, as well as higher investments. 
Return on investor capital, including Goodwill, was 19.3% in 2021. 
This was 40 basis points higher than in 2020. 
The improvement in ROIC was due to the higher net operating profit after tax, which more than offsets an increase in average invested capital following the three acquisitions. 
Please turn to slide 10 for the 2022 outlook. 
We continue to invest and position ourselves to unlock Novozymes's true sustainable long term growth potential. 
Organic sales are expected to grow by 3% to 7% in 2022, and sales in Danish kroner are expected to be around 3% points, including 
roughly 1% point from the acquisition of Synergia. 
The indicated ranges per business area are broader for the agricultural exposed areas, catering for higher implied in market volatility. 
The full year indications per business area are in line with the overall 2025 targets presented at our recent capital markets day. 
Seen over the year, we expect performance to be offered to a good start in 2022. 
The EBIT margin outlook for 2022 is between 25% to 26%, including an expectation of a slight year-on-year benefit from currencies. 
The margin will benefit from operational leverage, productivity improvements, as well as targeted price increases. 
This is expected to be more than offset by significantly higher input costs and continued investments in the business. 
Included in the outlook, the cross margin is assumed to decline by 1.5% to 2% points in 2022, compared to the previous year. 
We are making a dedicated effort to pass on higher input costs. And while we expect this to have a net neutral impact on our year-on-year sales growth, 
the effort is expected to be supportive to the cross margin, and it's included in the outlook. 
The free cashflow before acquisitions 
is expected at 1.7 to 2.1 billion Danish kroner, including a significant step up in net investments to support our growth opportunities. 
Net investments are expected at between 2.5 and 2.8 billion Danish kroner. 
The increase in net investments reflects maintenance, expansion, and optimization CapEx, as well as investments to support our ambitions in the food and health related areas. 
The amount we expect for net investments in 2022 includes roughly 1 billion kroner related to the advanced specialty protein facility in Blair. 
When adjusting for the protein investment, net assessments add up to around 10% CapEx to sales ratio, which is in line with what we communicated at our capital markets day. 
The outlook for the return on investor capital, including Goodwill, is for 16% to 17%. 
Subject to approval at the annual shareholders meeting in March, the dividend is proposed at 5 1 / 2 Danish kroner per share 
up by 5% from the year before, and corresponding to a payout ratio of 48.5%. 
In addition, a share buyback program of up to 500 million Danish kroner has been approved for 2022. 
This is in line with our capital structure policy to return the free cash flow generated to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks at a net debt to IBITDA ratio of around 1. 
With this, I'll now hand back to Ester for a wrap up, before we open up for questions. Ester, please? 
Thank you. Thank you, Lars. Please, uh, turn to slide number 11. Thank you. 
I'm very pleased, uh, with the strong set of both financial and non-financial results that we have delivered in 2021. 
We grew our sales 6% organically, with double digit growth in three of five business areas. 
We delivered solid earnings and cash while still reinvesting significantly in the business. 
And we are on track to meet 12 out of the 13 of our non-financial targets. 
We expect the strong performance from 2021 to continue in 2022. 
And we are guiding for a 3% to 7% organic sales growth with a solid EBIT margin that comes despite high input costs. 
Both ROIC and cash are impacted by high investments to secure growth of the business. 
Our relatively broad range, uh, for sales growth allows us to navigate through continued uncertainty related to the pandemic and volatile market conditions, 
similar to the way we position our outlook for 2021. 
At the beginning of 2021, we outlined four progress areas to allow you to follow our strategic execution from a different angle. 
One of them was to engage in at least three large commercial R&D collaboration. 
This goal was achieved with a collaboration with Saipem, with a key, a key player in the plant, uh, based industry, and with FMC in agricultural. 
The second progress area focused on commercializing innovation. 
This goal was also accomplished as more than 30% of our sales were from solutions launched during the last five years. 
Thirdly, we wanted to reach more customers and aim to generate at least 50% of our sales leads digitally. 
This goal was achieved as more than 60% of our new leads were generated digitally. 
And finally, we want to be a strong voice on the world stage for the ever increasing need of sustainable solutions. 
We wanted to take part in at least three global events linked to sustainability, and by participating at the World Economic Forum, 
the UN Global Compact Leaders, and the COP26 in Glasgow, we also reached our target for this key progress area. 
Executing on our strategy remains a top priority here in 2022. 
And pre key progress areas for us are achieving key milestones in the construction of the new production line for advanced protein solutions in Blair, Nebraska, 
leverage the rest and acquisitions and deliver double digit growth in human health. 
Continue to strengthen our commercial setup also by initiating investments in the first customer co-creation center. 
And finally, we will secure 
that we keep diligent focus on prioritizing in our core business, making sure we deliver on our short, as long as our long-term commitments. 
Novozymes is in a unique position to drive change towards a healthier planet. And as a company, we have a responsibility to make this happen. 
We have built an even stronger foundation over the past two years. 
And with our 60 year legacy in understanding biotechnology, we are committing to grow our business sustainably, 
making a lasting difference to the world and to all our stakeholders. 
And with this world, these words <unk> please, uh, let's now begin the Q&A session. Operator, please begin. 
Thank you. If you wish to ask question, please dial 01 on your telephone keypad now to enter the queue. 
Once your name has been announced, you can ask your question. 
If you find it's answered before its turn to speak, you can dial 02 to cancel. 
Our first question comes from the line of Gunder Sekmen of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Hi, good morning, uh, everyone. A few questions from my side. The first one is on a comment that you have in your release around the ROIC where you say that you expect NOPAT 
in 2022 to be lower, 
and that explains the lower ROIC guidance. 
Can I just confirm that, because if I take the midpoint of your organic growth guidance, put the Danish kroner guidance on top and an average margin, even at the higher tax rate of 22% in 2022, 
I get to about a flat NOPAT. So, uh, I'd like to understand why you have an assumption there that you have a lower NOPAT in 2022. 
Um, the second one, um, I was intrigued by your comments on pricing to pass on the higher raw material costs. 
Can you give us some, uh, guidance, what you've already seen in the field 
and what you're expecting to experie- see in 2022, because there's not usually, the enzyme market is not usually one where you see positive pricing. 
Um, so some commentary there would be very helpful. 
Um, and then lastly, one for Tina, if I can sneak that one in as well. 
You sound very bullish on BioAg, usually at the beginning of the year, you have a wide guidance range, uh, a wider guidance, guidance range in BioAg. 
What gives you the confidence, uh, for the strong growth that early in the year already in BioAg, please? 
Uh, thank you, Gunder, for these very good questions. I'll, I'll comment on pricing and then, uh, I'll pass it to Lars for the, uh, fu- uh, building on your co- comments on, on, uh, ROIC and then, uh, 
Tina on, on BioAg. 
So on, uh, on pricing, what gives us the confidence? 
I mean, it's not, uh, we have not started the journey on pricing, uh, today. 
This is a long journey that we have already been working, if you remember, uh, for, for, already since the, since the time, for sure, since I have been, uh, in the team, 
eh, and we start seeing the benefits of those focus last year, and this year we're doubling our en- energy in this segment. 
We live in extraordinary circumstances with a rapidly increasing raw material prices. 
As you seen, have you s- heard last saying, we did a fantastic job 
this year flowing and, uh, uh, postponing the impact of this, uh, high increased raw material till Q4, but we're not immune. 
And this opens a fantastic, uh, situation for environment for our 
discussions and conversations with our customers as contracts expire, as contracts sunset, to bring out the discussion of value on price on the table. 
And we aiming for a space where we are gonna move into a positive impact from pricing in gross margin, 
but then yes, uh, overcome, uh, by the higher raw material price increases. And then overall, uh, still with a, 
a slightly compaction of, of gross margin of 1.5% to 2%. 
And then I'll pass it to you, Lars. 
Yes. 
And thanks, Ester. And, uh, and, uh, Gunder, to your question on, 
on, on, on ROIC. Uh, clearly the biggest, uh, impact on the lower, uh, return on invested capital is coming from, 
from the invested capital component, uh, where the, uh, the acquired assets, uh, from our acquisitions 
is, is increasing, in- is increasing the, the invested capital, uh, number. 
So the, uh, the, the NOPAT, uh, is a smaller impact. 
Um, and of course our guidance, uh, is sort of a, a range on a number of parameters. Uh, and so therefore, um, our comments should be seen in, in that light. Um, 
I think the key point is that the biggest impact on ROIC is coming from invested capital. 
And then I'll answer on, uh, uh, the agriculture and animal health and nutrition comment on the BioAg specifically. 
So, um, yes, we do, uh, guide, uh, a relatively broad range here from high single digit growth to the low teens. 
And, um, if we, if we just take a step back in that area and in these Ag exposed areas, 
the growth drivers is both innovation, it's market penetration, it's sustainability. And then there's also support, uh, when the commodity prices are high, given that what we deliver is a… And, uh, the commodity prices are high. 
Given that what we deliver is a yield benefit and that has more value, in a high commodity, uh, market. 
Um, if you, if you look at the performance in, in 2021 in agriculture and animal health and nutrition, then you have to remember 
it, it was a flat performance, 
uh, you have to remember the 60 million which we saw in 2020, 
and also, um, we grew 7% in Q4, 
so we are on a strong trajectory and we also think there is some timing and that is supporting the high expectation for 2022. 
Next question, please. Thank you. That comes from the line of Michael Method at Nodia. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yeah. 
Thanks a lot. Uh, just two questions. Uh, one to, uh, Greentech uh, maybe, 
Tina, you have, previously, talked about the, 
uh, impacts from in times to, uh, to COVID 19 testing. Maybe we could just details for us also how, how much of growth was impacted by this in 
Q4 in 2021 and how much is, uh, expected in 2022. 
Uh, and then secondly, to, to Lars, regarding, uh, 
CapEx. So is, should we assume that 2022 levels are the, the peak or would there be one more sort of, uh, significantly elevated and then sort of feeding off from, uh, from there? Thanks a lot. 
Tina, and, huh, 
Las. Yeah. So in, uh, Green and Tech, uh it's… if you look at the, yeah, both for the year and the quarter, then roughly 70% of the segment is coming from Green 
and 30% is coming from tech 
and that means that, uh, and within the tech segment, as you know, we have many different businesses, so diagnostics is a small part of, uh, uh, that, so it is a small impact. 
And on 
CapEx, uh, we, uh, guided, uh, in the capital markets day back in September for a CapEx to sales ratio of around, uh, 10%, uh, through, uh, the period to 2025. 
And then on top of that, we have our, uh, uh, advanced protein facility in, uh, in Blair. 
Now, uh, the latter is, uh, roughly 2 billion Corona in total, uh, over the three year period 21, uh, to 23. 
Um, and we, uh, recorded roughly 200 million in 21. 
Another 1 billion is expected here in 22 and so this leaves a residual, roughly 800 million for, for 2023. 
Um, the good thing is we have, uh, progress, uh, in line with our plans, 
uh, but, uh, exactly how, uh, the, uh, the, uh, recording of the CapEx plays out, of course, uh, is subject to a bit of uncertainty. 
So, uh, this is, uh, our expectations right now. 
Um, so you have to set… to add that the residual component of roughly 800 million, uh, to the 10% also in 2023. Sure. Understood. Thanks a lot. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang at Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yeah. inaudible a few questions. 
It was a few on household care, actually. Um, 
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the reduced, um, demand in Europe and private label issues. I know we were talking about them back at Q3, 
but, um, can you confirm that the European issues are still sort of related to 
down trading and, you know, when you think about your guidance, the 2% to 4% for 2022, can you just kind of clarify or explain w- what you're factoring for both those two elements? 
And then the second question still on household care, um, we've seen a bit of news around activism and restructuring, um, one of your big household care customers, Unilever, and 
in the past, I think in the industry when we've had activist cases or cost cutting, 
um, it's led to lower levels of customer innovation and, and reformulation. So I was wondering whether you 
see this as a risk? 
Or whether you're seeing anything, whether you see this as a risk this time around for you, or, you know, what has changed in the household landscape versus a couple of years ago? Thanks. 
Thank you, Nicola. And Hanas, could you please, uh, take those questions? 
Yeah. So thanks. Let me start with, uh, with Europe and what's, what's going on. 
So, uh, the result of, uh, the performance in the retail market was that laundry, which is, by far, our largest single segment, is down 5% on volume. 
And, uh, the way we look at it, it's a few different, uh, sort of trends that's going on. We see customers, they are trading down to, uh, lower, uh, tiered brands. 
We also see the customers are washing a little bit less than what they did last year. 
And then of course we see the private label segment being under a lot of stress 
and stress comes in different forms. It comes with, uh, two, two of our LA midsize customers have gone out of business, 
but also comes in, in a way, where you can see that they're actually losing substantially more than, uh, than the big brands. 
And our exposure to the private label market, uh, has traditionally been, uh, been quite strong. So from that perspective, we also get, um, ge- quite, get quite some, some challenge in Europe. 
And I think when, when you look at the guidance for the full year, uh, looking at household care, uh, 
Europe is actually the single and only area compared to our plans that de- delivers the deficit to our original guidance. 
So that's what's going on. Looking ahead on Europe. Uh, we plan for a flat European market next year. 
Uh, we believe that, uh, we have sort of seen the bottom of this. We also believe that the private label pain that we saw that that will travel to other private labels. 
So for us, then that's, um, I think, a good, um, belief that we'll see sort of the… we've seen the bottom of the European market. 
Now, if we turn to the next, uh, question, uh, this is very… it's, it's difficult and, and, of course, I can only speculate it and can tell you what had… what happened in the past. 
Um, of course, we've seen investor pressure coming in and it has shown itself in, in different shapes and forms. 
Um, this time around, I think it's uncertain to say what's going to, maybe, happen to Unilever. 
We know that Unilever is on a journey where they are really driving sustainability heart. 
We have very strong conversations and, and also a very strong pipeline with Unilever and I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure that some of that will come through. 
It's too early to tell if there's going to be any negative impact. 
Right now we don't see it. And our conversations are, are positive towards, uh, towards growth and innovation. 
I think that's it 
Very well said there Hanas. Nikola, you did not really, implicitly, ask for it, but I would like to build on, on Hanas' comments on what gives us the trust 
on the two four… 2.4 guidance, and also on the long term growth. 
It is the… For, for one step, very strong penetration of, uh, 
freshness that we see the broad launch is sticking and, uh, and, uh, dra- contributing to the growth and also contributor to the growth of 2022. 
The continued penetration of our solutions in emerging geographies that they do grew least this year and they will continue to grow. 
And then the strong momentum and the pull for our customers for sustainable solutions, replacing chemicals and detergents. 
All these parameters, they make us confident that there is a growing path and that we are moving in the right direction to that growth path. 
Next question, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Lars Topholm of Carnegie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yes. 
Congrats with, uh, another strong quarter. A couple of questions on, uh, on my side. 
Uh, should the guidance, uh, since you are passing on, the input custom place, at least partly, 
I just wonder to what extent, uh, that boosts your organic growth guidance and in line with 
that, uh, both you asked and Lars mentioned that you were off to a strong, uh, beginning of 2022. 
So just wonder what you mean by that. And if this implies the year is going to be front end loaded. 
Uh, and then, uh, second question goes on, 
uh, alternative proteins, because early in the year, you send out a press release, 
mentioning that you would like to sort of drive the, the creation of a micro protein industry party, or, or 
I don't know what, what the right word is, is. 
Uh, to my knowledge, you don't have any significant micro protein products in the markets. 
Uh, am I wrong? Is this something that is going to, to, to come? Why are you doing this? And should we expect 
any micro protein announcements going forward? Thank you. 
Thank you, Lars for, for your, uh, very kind comments. Yes. We feel, uh, very pleased with the results and also, uh, that we expect a good start for, for the year. I'll, 
I'll let Lars answer your first question and then, um, uh, Amy, uh, follow up on your second one. Yeah. 
So on, on our assumptions, uh, on, on pricing, um, our 2022 
outlook, uh, uh, includes a net neutral impact from price on the top line. 
Um, we benefit from, uh, our targeted price increases, but we have also included, uh, some volume loss, uh, risks. 
Um, so, so that's how we have, uh, built our guidance for, for the year, 
um, while the mid effect on top line is neutral, uh, we expect the minor positive contribution to the gross margin. 
Um, and, um, and, and as, as I just explained earlier on, uh, we are looking, uh, to effectuate these price increases as, uh, contracts expire. 
So our commentary on, on being off, uh, or expecting to be off to a good start, uh, it's important to understand, uh, that wording of expecting to be off to a good start, 
uh, uh, so we are really commenting on the fact that, 
um, that the, uh, for the first quarter, uh, and, and for the beginning of the year, we, uh, we see and, and expect, uh, the, the momentum we had the, uh, in the, 
uh, last part of 21 to continue into 22, 
um, and therefore just trying to set the expectations for, uh, our first, uh, uh, reporting of Q1, uh, in April. 
So, so does, does this imply around a 7% organic growth rate for, for Q1? 
Um, so that we are not commenting on Lars, we are just saying that we have, uh, 3% to 7% for the year, and then, uh, that we are, uh, expecting a good, uh, start through the year. 
No. But you grew 7% in the end of 2021. And if, if you are implying that growth is continuing wouldn't that bring Q1 in, 
at least in the high end of, of, of your guidance range? So- Or am I completely misunderstanding what you were telling me? 
So what I was saying is that we were continuing the same momentum, uh, from, uh, Q4. I didn't say we would have exactly the same growth rates. 
Um, so, uh, so I think if anything, uh, we, 
we are saying that we expect the first, uh, quarter of the year to be, uh, at least on average, uh, for the full year, uh, growth. 
And, and I think that's, as far as we can, uh, help you on the first quarter, uh, expectations. 
Fair enough, Lars. That's fair enough. And if I take the second question, uh, Lars, run alternative proteins, 
um, maybe to, to put this into context, um, our alternative proteins, um, development really fall into the two categories, if I link it back to the strategy. 
The first one in the expense space, which is our investment in Blair and everything we're doing 
in that area, which, um, would be hitting us within the next three years, in terms of really scaling up into growth. 
And then we have a piece of what we're working on, which is into our Explorer category from a strategic perspective, which is really looking at 2025 and beyond. 
Um, and that's really where the micro protein falls into play. So the announcement we made, um, last year was a around an open call for innovation 
around micro proteins, really looking to couple the work that we're doing internally, from an innovation perspective, 
with outside innovation and creating, um, an environment and a network, um, to accelerate innovation in the area. 
So we don't have anything that you should be expecting in the next year, um, this is really about that explorer area into micro protein for the long term growth. 
But, but, but, Amy, ju- just to follow up on that, doesn't that mean it would be fair to assume that if we take a, sort of, five year perspective, 
uh, you, your alternative protein portfolio, five years from now, should be significantly broader than 
what you have already announced and, uh, investing specifically in, in, in, in Blair? 
I think that's fair from an aspiration perspective, right? So, I mean, what we've announced with Blair would be that, three years following the startup, we would reach a billion DKK of sales. 
This micro protein space would be, beside that, but again, on a longer term basis. Thank you very much, Amy. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Jones of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. 
Thank you very much for taking my questions too, if I may please. The first on the margin this quarter, I think you talked about 400 basics points lower, underlying EBIT margin year on year, due to sales and distribution, 
could you give us a bit more color on exactly what in sales and distribution expenses, um, increased? and how we should think about that going into 2022? 
And, uh, second question on food, beverage, and health. Um, you talked about, sort of, raw inaudible optimization and ingredient replacement in bakery 
having a positive impact, both in 2021 and expected in 2022. 
Um, could you give us a bit more color on, sort of, how that depends on, say, commodity prices, um, versus how much is a structural evolution to the banking industry. Thank you. 
Excellent. Thank you. Very, very, very good questions, Alex. Lars, if you could, uh, answer the first one and then, uh, Hanas built on the dynamics on banking. Thank you. 
Yes. Uh, absolutely. 
So, um, so our operational expenses in the fourth quarter, uh, were, uh, significantly higher than they were in the beginning of the year. 
Um, and this called out, uh, actually already in the, uh, in our release of the second quarter that we were expecting higher operational costs in the, in the second half. 
And the majority of those, uh, hit in the, in the fourth quarter. 
So, uh, so what they were, uh, were for example, uh, uh, in c- commercial investments, we had in our one health areas, 
where we had significant investments in cross channel and cross geography 
promotion, and new product launches, uh, building on our acquisitions, uh, of, uh, of the, uh, uh, two and now three, uh, companies, uh, in the area. 
Um, we initiated a number of clinical trials, 
um, and we also across the businesses, not only in, uh, in the area, one health, but also in the other areas, uh, had, uh, significant investments in, in digital solutions. 
Um, so those were some of the key factors that impacted the fourth quarter spent, uh, primarily in the sales and distribution area. 
And when we look forward to, to 22, um, then the fourth quarter of last year is, is not the appropriate benchmark for, for how 22 would, uh, would look like. 
Um, so, um, so as we set on the, on the gross margin, um, we expected for the year to be one and a half to 2%, this points lower than what we saw for 21, 
um, um, maybe to give you an idea of, uh, of the other, uh, line items, 
uh, then, um, admin cost is, is probably, uh, uh, a good assumption to be in line with history at 5% to 6%. Um, 
we have historically had R&D costs of, uh, of, of 13, um, 
S&D uh, 11 to 12, uh, but, uh, on the latter too, uh, we have consciously chosen to, uh, shift a bit of our resources from R&D to S&D. 
Um, so I think, uh, you would probably see a slightly higher S&D ratio, uh, maybe closer to 12, uh, or twelve-ish, uh, uh, and, and R&D, 
uh, maybe still in line with a, with a 13 or so. 
Um, so I think, uh, that is maybe a, a good way to think about how the cost composition would be in, in 2022 
and arriving at an EBIT Martin of 25% to 26%. And on food and bever- Of 25 to 26%. 
And on food and beverages, I'll just expand a little bit on how growth is, uh, composed in, in 21. 
So, the, the major driver for us was very strong underlying demand 
and innovation and market penetration. That made up more than 2 / 3 of the growth in, in food and beverages. 
Then we saw especially in the brewing space, uh, some recovery that also supported growth, and then we come to raw material optimization. 
And absolutely, as you, as you highlight, that was mainly in baking. 
What happened in baking was we saw certain shortages of raw materials like vital wheat gluten, we saw quite some inflationary pressure 
on ascorbic acid emulsifiers and so on. 
And then you can ask, Well, does this stick? We believe when we talk to customers, that it is actually quite sticky. Uh, and that's a business that will continue. 
Um, our estimate is betrween 2 / 3 and 3 / 4 of this that will stick. 
And the reason that we believe it will stick is that, um, customers, they use it to sort of drive, priv… uh, clean labor claims. They of course also do it because of the stability of cost, 
and then there is some pain associated when we, which would make these reformulations. 
So all of this makes us quite confident, um, that what we have seen of reformulation and optimization will actually remain in, um, 22 and the years to come. 
Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Sam Sansa of SBC. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Um, yes good morning. Just two questions from my side. First, on 
the last, regarding the, 
the, the market bridge from the 27% underlying in 2021 to the 26.5. If you could just give us the components, 
um, to, to bridge that gap. 
And then, secondly, you had quite impressively, product launches, 14 product launches 
in 2021. Uh, solutions you could say. Could you highlight the most important ones in terms of sales growth contribution 
over the next five years? 
Lars. Yes, so on the first question, 
um, so from the 27% on the line, um, the most, 
uh, important, uh, facts towards the 25 to 26%, uh, abid market guidance for 22, um, is 
the lower, uh, cost margin, uh, which we believe, uh, will be 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower 
than, uh, than what we saw in, uh, 
2000 and, and 21. Um, we are also continuing to, uh, invest, uh, in our business, 
um, and therefore, um, as I just outlined, will our expectations, or at least, the you… the way you can think about some of the individual cost lines, 
we're still investing, uh, also in both sales and distribution and also R & D, uh, on a growing top line. 
Um, so we don't see any significant, uh, out of the ordinary, uh, items in the, uh, in, in, our 2022 numbers. 
Um, so those would be the, the significant, uh, drivers of the margin, 
uh, arriving from the 27% last year to, uh, 25 to 26% in 2022. 
And on to your second question, 
uh, we make 14 launches, we love them all. 
Uh, they… it's, it's hard to choose which is the one we feel more proud of. 
They all contributing to what it has been already also a trajectory of, uh, where innovation continues to be a strong contributor of our growth. 30% of our sales this year, 
they were coming from launches we make in the last five years. 
But if you make me… if you ask me, Where would you see that contributing in the future? 
It would be across all fronts. So from one side, uh, we have, uh, very high expectations on our launches in animal, 
nutrition. On, I guess, including the latest launch we have made, uh, in aforious animal nutrition. 
Very strong, uh, trend on the momentum in freshness with a broad launch 
that continues to contribute to the, uh, to contribute to growth in, in household care. 
Very good momentum in human health, 
uh, very high level of cross-fertilization on the acquisitions that we brought in and also 
the, the tangible example from innovation from, uh, from our innovation muscle and then also cross-fertilization across the globe. 
And then, uh, lastly, not to mention, if, uh, strong trend in the, in the market for consumers for healthier foods. 
Some by replacement of chemicals as, uh, oh, ingredients… That's as Hannis mentioned, but the strong, also, driver for nutritional changing habits 
in seeking for plant-based solutions where our enzymes contribute. 
If you couple that with, uh, also, a stronger penetration in the margin share office, 
I have to close your question saying we love them all, and, uh, we pleased with the 30% 
contribution of innovation, and we know that innovation is a key contributor of our long-term growth. Okay, thanks for that. Thank you. 
Our next question on the line comes from Sam Perry at Credit-Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. 
If I look at your two-year stack organic growth, your 22 died at the mid-to-upper end in high double digits in mid-term growth on 
a two-year basis. This is a level that hasn't been seen 
on a two=year basis since pre- 2015 when commodity prices were also much higher. 
Similarly, if I look at the midpoint of your sales in eBit growth, eBit guide for 22 is broadly in line with 2016, despite having some acquisitions. 
So I guess my question is how much of your ability to print these higher growths 
and earnings numbers is based on changes you've made to the business over the past five years 
in new innovation, and how much is based on increasing soft commodity prices and customers reformulating toward enzyme-based products? Thank you. 
We, we… thank you for your question. Uh, we have launched, as you, as you, recall our strategy in, in, 
uh, September and, uh, a lot of the fruits that we're seeing today are already from the work made from the past, 
uh, steps we're taking from the implementation of the strategy. It's a combination of both. 
We're just capitalizing on the headwinds we're seeing in the market. We're not shy of that, 
but then also many of those ones, they sticky. They stay. We know that once you've tried our solutions, 
then our customers fall in love with a value propositions of sustainability that we bring in, 
and that's a culture across all fronts. 
In animal nutrition, where we bringing beyond increased prat, uh, protein enhancement, also lower manure, 
like in baking, where we, it's… we're moving into natural, and, uh, chem… uh, formulation, and, uh, clean, clean labels enabling. 
Or detergents, leading to washing… consumers who can wash at lower temperatures and replacing chemicals. 
So there is good momentum, we're capitalizing on that, but that is a lot of self-help. 
And the self-help comes from, uh, proactive investments we've made in the <unk> office on assets, on people, on labs. 
The self-help also comes from acquisitions that we have made in human health to maximize 
the potential that we have as a biotech company and to contribute to the work in, uh, in a very rapidly growing trend on, uh, healthier needs. 
Same will be for plant-based proteins, on investments we've made in 
Blair, we're making on Blair, that's one of the key milestones also for this year to move ahead with those investments, and that will be a contributor, also for the future growth. 
Great, thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question on the line comes from Charles Bentley at Jeffries. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Thanks for taking my questions. 
So I just have two. So one is just around the comments around household care. Um, that Europe has already blossomed and, uh, and private labels you'll see a shifting. 
I mean, is what you're already seeing in Q1, 
um, because the guide implies kind of an acceleration versus the Q4 exit rate. So, I want to understand whether this is what you can already see, 
that in January and then coming through the order book for the rest of the fourth, fourth quarter, 
or does this assume that this picks up at some point. 
And then secondly, just on, on, on the… and just another question on the, the kind of Q4 margins and the commercial investments you've mentioned, 
I mean, it seems to suggest that something like $100 million in costs in Q4. 
I think previously you've suggested it would be something like $300 million total. 
Is that, is that right? Uh, and, and then kind of related to that, what's the, what's the likely phasing on the remaining costs? Thank you. 
Uh, thank you, Charles. I'll let Hannis answer your first question, and then Lars can you build up 
on the second one? Thank you. 
Yeah, so, so of course we have one month in, in the books and it confirms what I said before, that, um, we believe that Europe will look around flat, maybe slight, slight growth. 
That's what, what, we see now. And that's also what we see in the order books. 
And I would say on the, on, on the spend in the fourth quarter, um, 
I don't know, but I assume the $300 million you refer to is, is the costs that we, 
uh, carved out, uh, all the way back in, uh, in ' 19 when we started, uh, 
to, uh, sort of re-shape our cost structures towards sales and distribution. Um, 
I think now we are almost three years later, and I think it becomes very difficult what was, say, carved out, and, and what is now invested where. 
So I would maybe rather, uh, look at, uh, our commitment to continue to invest in our business, which we also do, and imply in our guidance here for 2022. 
Um, and then we have also provided the long-term guidance back in the capital markets day that we aim for a margin of 26% in, in 2025 or above. 
Um, and no individual year going below 25. And, and that's what we're guiding for here in 2022, with a continued investment in our business to support the organic sales growth. 
Great, thank you very much. We have time for one more last… One last question, please. 
Thank you. That comes from the line of Sebastian Bray at Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. 
Hello, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. They're primarily focused on growth margin development. 
I can understand why the current raw material environment would mean that the outlook is, 
let's say, downwards for 2022. 
What makes me curious is what the company thinks of as its mid- to long-term growth margin? 
If price recovery is good enough, 
do we get the 100 to 150 basis points back? 
Is there anything in 2023 onwards, is there anything to suggest the current decline 
in gross margins may prove permanent as opposed to temporary? 
And secondly, a quick question on plant-based meat and products. 
If I say, as a rough guess, I think Novozymes is making a little less than $100 million DKK in this area on an annualized basis. Am I getting warm? Thank you. 
Thank you Sebastian, good morning. And I'll let Lars answer your questions. 
Yes, uh, thanks Sebastian. Uh, so, um, so right now, um, we are, uh, like many other companies, impacted by the higher input costs 
and therefore we are guiding to a lower gross margin of 1.5 to two percentage points. 
Uh, we are also seeing that we are taking actions to pass on some of those higher input costs to our customers over time. 
Um, and therefore we see a small positive contribution from that, uh, pricing initiative on our gross margin. 
Um, and then I would say we are, we are still continuing to see the productivity improvements we have continued to see for years and years and years, 
uh, leveraging the scale, and the volume growth in our facilities. 
So, in the long-term, we still see potential to still expand gross margin from productivity, from scale, 
um, and then we, we will see, uh, how the future develops both in terms of input costs and also in terms of price discussions. 
But the fundamental factors that enables us to see gross margin expansion, uh, those are intact. 
And then of course there are more parameters, like we're now experiencing in ' 22, which will determine the actual gross margin in, in the individual year. 
Thank you, Lars. And that, uh, closes the session. Oh, oh. 
Sorry, Hannis. Just build off the second question. 
I think there was a co-question around protein, and let me just expand on that, and I'll, I'll give you a specific guidance on how much we sell and whether the $100 million is warm or cold. 
But what we do, we have a sizable business on protein extraction and protein modification 
that relates to meat patties, both delivering on taste and texture, and reduction on salt. 
It's a business that's growing very very nicely right now. 
And of course when you look at the trends, we have a lot of hope and faith that we'll continue to grow for all Novozymes. 
And now yes. Thank you very much for all your questions. Thank you for your time, and looking forward to continue the conversations with you in the forecoming days. 
Wishing you a very nice day. Thank you.
