ENO. I am inaudible ENO Internet Group, very nice to meet you. All financial closure is at the end of December, 
so here, we are today ta-… to talk about inaudible quota 2021, covering July to September. There is inaudible today. 
This is a summary slide for third quarter 2021, covering July to September. 
We have delivered better than… better performances for top n bottom line 
year on year. 
Internet infrastructure was steady and strong. Online ads and media saw improvements, 
and crypto c-… asset grew big to become the third pillar for our businesses, just to cover the bases. 
So, this is year to date, covering January to September. 
You see from net sales all the way down to net profit. We have made records in all performances. 
inaudible only our profits and net profit saw, at the end of third quarter, it's already performing better than the last year full t-… full year. 
This is covering July to September in different segments, in a summarized formats. 
All the way at the right-hand side is 
my subjective course of different segments. Uh, that's, that's usual, using circle, triangle, and X. 
For your information, 
we can made the second quarter's course right next to it. 
All the way to the right is my objective assessment at third quarter. Infrastructure 
remains to be double circle. The X, also inaudible transformation, have made advancement. 
People are spending more at home and more consumption at online. This inaudible business has become even stronger. 
Access, which is main business of us, has saw some change in sales mix, 
and we have made a strategic investment for inaudible. Therefore, the growth might s-… new 
ones, but business as a whole is very steady. 
Advertising media remains to be double circles. 
Media services are some decline due to less spending at home than the peak for some customers and because we now have stricter rules for ad standards, 
but this segment's business conditions, generally, are trending very well 
and showing this V-shape recovery, and, uh, I, I, I, I believe this sh-… V-shape recovery will continue. 
Uh, for finance, uh, I gave, in the second quarter, single circle, but I decided to give double circles for 
this quarter. 
Business is rather stable than the same time last year when effect spread was lowered, but the earnings have improved. 
And CFD was quite high for its volume of transaction and earnings. 
Now, 
inaudible known as inaudible, joined the group officially, and that process is completed. 
Um, but the, the inaudible, the consultation starting from that fourth quarter, 
uh inaudible team and us will create synergy to make this finance business, 
uh, with the very positive progress in growth, and that's my expectation. 
Lastly, but, uh, least is crytocurrenc-… crypto assets. 
So, I give, uh, double circles, uh, just as I give, um, for second quarter. 
The business is stable we are making aggressive but steady marketing activities. 
Has become the third pillar of our business, only next to infrastructure and finance. 
Now, here is my view in a comprehensive way, in a way of how the business trending. 
So, first, within group, uh, we have more than 100 subsidiaries, but, uh, in a inaudible companies. 
Looking at the most inaudible of those, those different group companies, different mechanisms that we are putting place, performances, 
I see very good performances that is tangible. Uh, we… 
I am now have more confidence in growth trajectory for next five, 10, 30 years to come. 
That would be my summary for third quarter. Please go to next slide. 
This is showing you segment then segment changes over top inaudible online, uh, so, uh, yeah, uh, year. 
On the left-hand side is in itself. Right-hand side represent profit. For the net sale, 
we have improved by 5.6 billion yen. For creating profit, we have improved by one.91 billion yen. 
Crypto assets, so a pillar of the business, and our finance growth, which has made a improvement to our earnings inaudible. 
Next, want to talk about our return policy to shareholders. 
As you can see at the very top, 
our basic policy for return to shareholder, in total, in total, is 50% of re-… 
and out of that 50%, we will allocate 33% for dividends 
that remain, and remaining 17% will go to share buy-back. 
In the middle of the slide, you see the dividend amount per share in quarter. 
So, the third quarter, we will give… we will have 3.4 yen higher dividend compared to that same time last year, 
which makes this 10.8 yen per share for third quarter. 
At the very bottom is our update on share buy-back. 
We have a plan to buy back as much as 5.63 billion yen, 
uh, share buy-back. We have more update progresses yet, but we will implement, uh, before the terms come, which is at the end of February next year. 
Now, we have overview of our inaudible. I'd like to introduce Yasuda inaudible, who is the group's CFO. Thank you. 
Well, this is Yasuda speaking. I'd like to walk through, uh, business of inaudible overview. 
So, first off, this is segment by segment, s-… net sales performances by quarter. 
At the very bottom is dark blue, which is our net solid basis. 
This is growing steadily. Uh, the contribution from green, which is crypto asset, is, mm, becoming bigger. 
Now, like to show you segment by segment, quarter by quarter, net operating profit performance. 
The transaction of crypto asset has saw some reduction from the first half, but earnings, generally speaking, are performing quite well. 
Now, this is the summary for our group companies. We have 10 listed companies within- We have 10 listed companies within the group. 
Here, we have shown market stats and ownership. At the very end, the total market stats of the group companies count 
about 1.8 trillion yens. Our equity ownership counts higher now than 600 billion yen. 
This is summary of our four business segments. Size of the areas shows the size of the revenue. 
Numbers of account, contracts for internal infrastructure and a number of accounts at the FX securities and crypto assets and shown. 
Showing customer-based growth to be 13.97 million in total. 
Next one is our partners. We call our employees partners and that's our update on that. 
At the end of September we have 6,767 partners. 
We are especially saw some from growth in partners because of acquisitions of GEICO X by GMO. 
Amounts and engineers and creators count at 46.7%. 
Our target is, has 50% or more of our partners to become engineers. 
This is essential for us to create uh better things with a higher quality we'd like to in but more engineers and creator to be our 
group. Next 
one is infrastructure business. 
This is internet infrastructure, 
business summaries. We have domain business, uh crowd 
hosting, digital sound, BC platform, SL service athletion, payment access, all of which are number one with its own territories. 
All of them are essential. All of them are not gone in their the age of the internet. 
Next, I'd like to talk about internet infrastruc quarter-by-quarter revenue performances. 
Online spending and uh at home spending were performing well from last year. 
We are just group of number one businesses, 
therefore we are very healthy and steadily growing. Payments uh by the uh 
GFO Financial gage is potentially is growing very positively from the next generation platform called Sterra 
and that will give us more revenue sources for transactions. 
Access, which is one of our biggest business, saw some self in exchange. We had some differences in trend from historically, 
but if you take access and access related numbers, here's how the performance looks like. As you can see, 
if you take that numbers out, 
you can see we are steadily and healthily growing in a very steady manner. 
But what about access business? I'd like to spend some time talking about how access business is trending. 
These are the critical KPI's for access. One is top line revenue and the other one is number of top lines. 
You see number of top lines are keep growing, but the net sales is seeing some decline. 
And that should give you why the change in the revenue in terms of the trend. 
This is divided with inaudible Y mobile line and other lines. That red line is inaudible. 
Because of remote work and because of the remote businesses, this is suffering very real. 
This is Main Reef's stock revenue. 
Blue, on the other hand, which is mobile, 
ever since the second quarter we had some line quality 
also aggressive pricing by many bigger carriers have shown some impact. 
Well, mobile is initial end stock which means higher upfront payment. 
This mobile is struggling and that is the reason why access itself is performing weak. 
We believe this weak performance will continue until the first half of next year. 
But the stock lines show the obstacle will keep growing which means that impact will generally be canceled. 
So please also pay attention to the numbers of the growth in the numbers of lines. 
And we are promoting inaudible or other carrier e-carry business, 
but our brand, GMO E-carry Access is another area that we will be promoting selling more lines to our customers. 
Next, this is how operating processes were trending quarter-by-quarter. Operating process 
is generally speaking growing but we have made a big investment for GMO Sign 
and we have started the appreciation for goodwill therefore the growth, uh for now, has remained to be small. 
And this is numbers of contract. Numbers of customer accounts are 12.11 billion customers or accounts. 
The inaudible by digital sound also known as GMO Sign, 
we farewell good, 
farewell sign campaign last year but our customer base has been growing even after the campaign. 
We are now have 6.9 bigger customer base. 
We have 
in total 334 000 accounts. As you can see one of the big accounts are signed up with this program. We are number one in Japan. 
And this is numbers of the contract transaction. This is amount of transaction being send to the counterpress. 
This is showing how active our customers are using our services. Very important KPI. 
We are targeting to become number one in Japan for this particular KPI. 
Now, GMO Sign is uh give you 
more productivity for the work and can produce papers and we validated 
that we have proof of concept project with the inaudible called Suka. 
Time, cost and amount of paper can drastically be reduced and we validated that under this program. 
Yeah also please take note that the Digital Agency, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance have confirmed the legality of GMO Sign as a valid electronic signature in place 
of a name stamped. 
Going forward, we will continue to expand the functionality and provide support to companies and organizations that have adopted GMO Sign in order to make it a more secure and convenient service for both the public and private sectors. 
Next slide shows the transaction value trend for the eCommerce solutions business. 
In addition to the EC platforms developed by inaudible and inaudible, this business consists of new types of EC such as Minye and Suzuri. 
The quarterly transaction value is now close to 120 billion yen. 
Compared to the previous year when the transaction value inaudible due to the impact of COVID-19, the trend has been steady, especially for high priced plans. 
About 40% of the total transaction value was settled by GMO Payment Gateway. 
Excluding bank transfers and other payments 
most of the amount do… excluding bank transfers and other payments, most of the amount distributed to credit card and other payment services 
make use of the group services. And we believe this shows the strong synergy between the e-commerce solutions business and the payment business. 
Next is the advertising and media business. 
The page shows the trend and the breakdown of the quarterly net sales. Net scale was up 5.9% year on year 
in online advertising although affiliate advertising was strong, 
sales fell below year over year due to a reactionary decline from stay at home demand among some customers in the advertising agency business 
and the inaudible standards for the ad network advertising. 
On the other hand, media sales grew significantly with unit advertising prices on a recovery track, a complete turn-around from the negative impact of the pandemic in the previous year. 
Next page shows the trend of quarterly operating profit. As you can see, since hitting the bottom in the third quarter of last year, the recovery trend is continuing. 
The results of internal initiatives, such as replacement of products, inaudible sales methods and cost reduction are continuing. 
And despite the temporary factors I mentioned earlier for the third quarter, business conditions are favorable for the segment as a whole. 
In the fourth quarter as planned from the beginning of the fiscal year, we've planned to inaudible investments, mainly on the media side. 
Now, next is the financial business. 
Quarterly performance transition on this page. 
In the same period of the previous year, profitability of FX lessened due to intensified competition in lowering the spreads 
but since the beginning of this year there has been no such competition and profitability has improved. 
inaudible also improved well resulting in increased sales and profits. 
This chart shows the FX trading volume and our domestic market share. The trading volume has remained at a high level 
although it has slowed down compared to last year when the market was inaudible due to the pandemic. 
We continue to enjoy the number one share of the FX market in Japan. And with the consolidation of inaudible 
FX now, uh, inaudible EX by GMO which joined the group in the second quarter, we expect our domestic share to reach 30%. 
We will continue to strengthen our synergy to become the overwhelming number one in Japan. 
Next is the crypto assets business. 
The crypto assets business consists of the three businesses shown on this page. 
These are mining business, the exchange business mainly operated by GMO Coin, and the payment business which issues stable coins. 
The chart here shows the trend and the breakdown of the net sales of crypto assets business. 
The pale blue colored exchange business at the bottom of the chart shows the decrease in both transaction volume and revenue compared to the first half of the year when the business was brisk. 
On the other hand, the blue colored mining business enjoys stability despite fluctuations in the external environment of crypto asset prices and global inaudible. 
The page shows the quarterly operating profit chart 
as compared to the same period last year. Profits increased by 1.09 billion yen, contributing to the performance of the third period of the business. 
Against this backdrop, GMO coin is strengthening it's marketing investment. 
In the second quarter we ran TV commercials mainly in the inaudible region and received an extremely positive response 
confirming the effectiveness of our efforts to raise brand recognition and awareness. 
In the fourth quarter, we have started the second phase of TV commercials by expanding the scope of the broadcast. We hope to further raise awareness and lead to account openings. 
As for the mining business, we will continue to develop our business in a calm and steady manner. 
Next I would like to talk about GDN, a stablecoin in the crypto assets payment business. 
GDN, which has been distributed to overseas exchanges since March the 1st will now be listed on Coinbase, 
one of the world's largest crypto asset exchanges. 
GDN is the world's first stablecoins that is linked to the Japanese yen and compiles with the regulations of U.S. financial authorities. 
We expect to further stimulate trading through the listing of GDN on Coinbase. 
Finally, let me share with you some of the highlights of the recent topics. 
First, let's talk about the NFT marketplace, other than GMO. 
As I told you last time, we started offering the beta version on August the 31st. 
And we are planning to release the official version in December. 
We're working on expanding the product line-up, developing systems such as the listing management screen so that a wide range of people can list their items 
and supporting multiple languages in order to become the most user friendly NFT marketplace by far. Please keep your eyes on the business. 
Now, next. Let's talk about GMO Aozora Net Bank. 
As an internet bank that is always at the side of small start-up companies, 
we will provide high quality, low cost services that meet the needs of our customers inaudible. 
With a corporate account that is easy for small and start-up companies to open as a gateway, 
we will offer services aligned to the growth phase of our customers such as bank API connections, loans, and inaudible incorporated financial services respond to the growth of numbers of transfers 
as well as issuance of a dedicated credit card when a company grows to be the size of a unicorn. 
By continuing to promote this series of initiatives, now named GMO Aozora Net Bank entrepreneur and challenge support project, 
we aim to grow together with small and start-up companies. 
Low cost services are essential to activate the use of the account. 
As you can see, our bank transfer fees are the lowest in the industry. 
The change in fees was triggered by a reduction in inter-bank fees by the inaudible network. 
And the decision to lower the fees was made in immediate response to the announcement by other banks on Sept- September the 30th, the day before the change on October the 1st. 
Normally, it takes at least a month for other banks to reduce their fees, as they need to place orders with vendors. 
Our swift and immediate response was made possible thanks to- Our swift and immediate response was made possible thanks to our in-house development capabilities. 
The number of corporate accounts that functions as a gateway has been steadily growing, as shown on the chart. 
The bar chart shows the number of companies that have signed up for the API connection. 
The bank API is a mechanism and specification for calling bank functions, such as balance inquiries and transfers from the outside. 
We provide the banking API itself free of charge, but we consider it as an important KPI that will lead to future transfers. 
We will contribute to the acceleration of DX, by having business companies incorporate the banking function. 
We will continue to blast forward as the API top runner. Please keep your eyes on this business as well. 
Lastly, I would like to talk about our initiatives in the area of next generation air mobility. 
As you know, the keywords like next-generation air mobility, flying cars, and drones, have been making the headlines recently. 
Honda has announced its policy to work on an electric, 
vertical takeoff and landing eVTOL aircraft, and Marubeni Corporation has also announced that it will purchase 200 units of eVTOLs. 
Now, why is GMO Internet Group entering the next generation air mobility market? 
The reason is that the sky is a market with the potential to become the last business frontier. 
In particular, flying car market is expected to reach 160 trillion Yen in size by 2040. 
It won't be long before flying cars, like those seen in Back to the Future, become a reality. 
I would also like to add that Kumagai, the group CEO, who has license for both helicopter and airplane, is the IT company CEO, who knows the best about the sky. 
In the areas of next-generation air mobility, with is expected to grow in the future, we are promoting these three initiatives. 
The first is our investment in a drone and air mobility fund, drone fund. 
This one aims to realize a drone base society, and air mobility society, and we began our investment back in 2019. 
The second is technological assistance through GMO GlobalSign in the field of drone security for communication and control with Prodrone and SkyDrive companies, in which the drone fund has been interesting. 
In addition, since May of this year, we have been participating in the public-private council for air transportation revolution organized by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 
and the Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. 
We are also participating in a study group for the implementation of flying cars at the Osaka Kansai World Expo. 
Technology licensing in the security field will be as shown on the page, 
in the operation of drones and flying cars, 
counter measures against security risks such as hijacking of airplanes, and operation systems, and falsification and tapping of communication data have been an issue. 
We will contribute in the field of security by access encryption, and airframe certification, using GlobalSign's SSL. 
In IOT, where everything is connected to the internet, the use of SSL will further advance. 
Please look forward to the future developments. 
Well, that is all for now. Thank you very much for watching. Internet for everyone.
