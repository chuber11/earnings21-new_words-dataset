This is Eduardo San Miguel. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Results Presentation 
that will be conducted, as always, by our Chairman Juan Llado. 
It will take something like 20 minutes and you can post your questions in the Q&A session that comes after the speech. 
And now I give the room to Mr. Juan Llado. Hi. Hello, 
everyone. I have a presentation that if I want to make it in 20 minutes, I'd like to make it in 20 minutes. 
I have to go fast and be precise. 
So I'll try to go fast through my slides. And then if you need some color to this presentation, 
I'm sure you will be get it through the, uh, Q&A session at the end. 
Okay. This presentation is structured basically in two points: is where are we today? 
You know, where are our third quarter results that you've already gone and read that we are giving a guidance of end of the year of a breakeven? 
And, and, and, and that, that breakeven, how it has been impacted… which I think we've, we've always talked about COVID and non- COVID. But I think now that as we see it, you know, in the back of us, 
I think it was an analysis and what… and what was the impact, you know, of our operations and how it has been impacted our 
sales margin and, and obviously, cash position? 
Once we go through that, which are the numbers and the analysis of those numbers, we'll, we'll go to what I think is extremely important, 
how do I see 2022 inaudible and, and we move, moving forward? What… Why are we well positioned and very well resourced 
to benefit from these new awards and the market, 
you know? And, and, and a brief summary, we have to go through awards. 
I mean we are well-positioned, because we have strong awards, quality excellent quality, and well de-risk. 
You know, we came with the problems and excuses that started towards the end of 2020 with all of the big factor that we had, had been reprogrammed. Now we cease the opportunity. We're speaking with our customers, how we can bring, 
you know, all those jobs, again to 2022 for many of the jobs they have moving forward to 2023. 
So all those restarting, you know, jobs… which is close to four billion, 
you know, it's, it's a big figure, are being reprogrammed back to reality. 
And positively, let's talk about future because we're really, you know, extremely well positioned in what we call energy transition. We have, we have customers. We have contracts, 
and we're taking a very proactive role. 
And taking a proactive role is good, and we'll talk about that later. 
And very important, because now with the SEPI agreement 
that we do expect the funds to come in shortly. We're financially back where we were at the end of, 
you know, 2019, where we had, you know, organized TR to grow with the big backlog that we had. 
So in all these four points allow me to be positive and, and say that we're extremely well positioned and well-resourced, you 
know, to go back to benefit, you know, growth and margin trends 
and that that will be summarized on my outlook and guidance. 
The first part, as I said, inaudible is impacted of, of, of COVID. You know, sometimes 
I was a bit bored, you know, about this slide, because it's one of those things that all, all, all 
of us think, you know, we… But I think it's worth it to do an analysis. 
You know, some companies have more impact. Some others had less impact. You know, we happen to be the ones that had more because of the stage of the backlog that we've got and the stage of our projects 
and where we had our project, which in most cases were the Middle East. 
So we had big impact in the managing of the site, mobilization, and demobilization. I'll come out with an example afterwards. 
Obviously, a big impact in managing the manpower and logistics, 
you know, lack of flights, visa problems, 
delays of equipment, quarantines, 
was to give you some examples, and obviously, the managing of subcontractors with the delays in claims. 
And that translates into how do we manage the project, 
which is starting on the days, are we able to, uh, progress? Are we reaching the milestones? Are we getting paid? 
Well, billing has been difficult. Billing at construction stage with the delays and not being able to reach milestones that we have by contract. 
It was very difficult. Some cases we have been successful in restructuring the inaudible, some others not. 
But up… Well today progress is back to the trend that it was before, 
and obviously, that those difficulties can always be resolved if we have good customers in face-to-face negotiations. 
But extremely difficult through Zoom or through Teams or through all, you know, all those new means that we are very proud of, 
which is good, but not to resolve conflicts. 
It's same with change orders. We have agreed lot of change orders with customers, and we're moving forward quite successfully with them. 
But those change orders will be translated in cash at the end of the project. They always are. 
So there is all the impacts of our, of our balance sheet and of our projects and working capital and 
cash. So site problems, manpower and logistics, and project management. And I think this is extremely well explained with one example. 
Let's, let's look at these graphs. And, and these… To give you an idea, I don't want to put the name of the, you know, the… customer's 
not here, and the name of the project, but I can tell you, it's in the Middle East 
and it's a billion plus project size. 
And, uh, it's a project that it was planned, and this is the, yeah, the first graph that it was planned 
by, uh, early 2021 to have manpower working on the site above 20,000 
workers. 
The reality is at that time, we only had 5,000 
and probably many of them under quarantine. 
Let's move on, on, on… If you have such few people, what was the progress? Let's look into the blue line again, and let's go to the next slide. 
If you go to the same date, you know, early 2021, obviously, the progress on that job should have been close to 80%. 
With, you know, with a billion, you know, and the cash comes behind the progress. 
Obviously, the progress at that stage early ' 21 was only 20%. 
You know, and that is… 
And with those two figures we had to manage the progress. We have to negotiate, obviously, with our customer, suppliers, and subcontracts. 
And let me give you some quick data. What does that mean? 
It means that we had to manage in… on that very specific job, more than 1,700 positive cases on site. 
We had to manage quarantines of close to 6,000 workers in that same site. 
And this is a realistic case. This is not theory, which translates in more than 70,000 manned days lost through those quarantines 
and, and, and why so many quarantines because we had to do more than 500 PCRs a day. 
Well, we have to go through that, and this is one example. But if you do an analysis, I do want to do it now in public about the jobs that we had in the Middle East. 
What was the backlog of the jobs that we had in the Middle East? You know, and we had in Kuwait. We had in South Arabia, we had in Emirates, 
and we had in Oman. You know, you may imagine, you know, we've gone through difficult time. 
But let me tell you, difficult times, extremely successfully managed by our team and with a good relationship with our customers. 
But with an impact. An impact in sales, an impact in cost, and an impact in cash. 
An impact in sales, that is extremely well seen in this, uh… because the backlog is what it is. 
And you've known, and some of people saying why you have so many… such few sales with such a big backlog? 
Well, I think it's very well explained in this, in this slide. If you go to, uh, end of 2019, 
we have the level of sales, which was close to 1. 3 billion Euros. 
inaudible You know, we went to bed, let me tell you, at the end of that quarter quite happy. 
You know, TR was… had gone through the oil and gas crisis and was back to growth. 
If you go to next… the last, the, the, the last two quarters, we haven't reached 700 million Euros, 
which is, give or take, sales figure, you know, close to 40 to 45% lower. 
It's not easy to manage your business when your sales figure, you know, you know, lowers down to, uh, 40% what you had before. 
And we've done it well. And that's why the breakeven figure. 
That translates in lower sales. It has an impact in margin. And obviously, it makes the management of our working capital quite tight. 
Quite tight as I think is reflected in the next, next slide. 
This quarter we had a negative 91 million Euros at the end of September. 
It was, it was… September, it is true that it was already a month of recovery. 
It was a month or a plan with using all the collection from our customers, 
and we were already back on business to pay our suppliers. 
We needed to run through progress on construction and to reach those desirable milestones 
with all our customers. And our suppliers continues to be in our plan as COVID, the real COVID is behind us. 
And obviously, with that plan, you know, if it's tight, and we need to run 
and the level of sales hasn't reached the level that we had before 
obviously, you… we can run through mismatches and we run into mismatch. A mismatch of one day 
that, you know, cash collection of one day $90 million that we readjusted, as, as, as you see right below the negative 91, you know, you know… 
There was a collection of 90 million that we would have, we would have shown a figure, an adjusted figure, so to speak… 
I don't, I don't want to use the name or the term adjusted anymore 
because I want to go back to reality of practically having a, you know, 
the breakeven cash figure. 
And that translating to the third quarter results. 
Third quarter results of a level of sales quite low, quite low, as I explained before, you know, despite of the backlog and despite of the awards. 
You know, as, as, as progress was slow… has been slow through September, improving now, little by little, 
but improving, and an EBIT and a real EBIT, therefore, of zero. And this is a breakeven quarter. 
And, and we do expect next month to have similar figure. 
I guess we, we like to… you know, we do expect to finish the year with the, with the two breakeven quarters. 
This is, you know… With that level of sales, this is, this is, this is the reality, and this is the real, non-adjusted 
a, a, a, account. And this is not adjusted EBIT result. 
Good news 
that, that, you know, market has picked up and the level of sales we go through them afterwards. The level of sales has improved… 
I'm sorry, the level of sales… the le- the le- the level of, of awards, 
order intake has improved substantially. 
And year-to-date… And we do think we're going to grow up a little bit. 
We have 7.7 billion, uh, 
um, awards which is way above $4 billion, which is 
very much, you know, the positive number, the, the good set of the number that I was expecting 
to… you know, you know, at the very beginning of the year. You know, you… we thought that the market was good. 
I don't see had much credibility one of the same period market. 
That was challenging, but I would reach in the four billion, and those four billion are here, 
which gives us the backlog, a very healthy backlog of 10.4 billion. 
So we have a breakeven two quarters, but the pullback in business with a good order intake and a very strong backlog. 
The backlog that I think is worth, you know, to do some, um, some analysis. 
And with that, with that backlog, uh, 
let's go with, with the second part of the presentation: Why are we well-positioned and well-resourced to 
benefit from this backlog and to benefit from this new market? 
First of all, because TR franchise is healthy, is very healthy, as has been reflected in the four billion of new awards. 
If you go one by one, you can see the quality and how those inaudible awards, in some cases, extremely de-risked. 
Two, because, obviously, it was difficult when you have awards… And we had in 2019 and, and, and to reprogram. 
It has an impact in our balance sheet. It has an impact in our resources. It has an impact on our cash. 
Well, now we're speaking with those customers. With some of them we have already concluded, and we'll be starting the four billion Euros of reprogrammed projects. 
That's good news. That's the second reason that allow me to say that we are very well positioned. 
Third, 
because probably 12 months ago, you know, uh, uh, energy transition 
was more 
a… you know, was more an idea than a reality. 
Now it's a real… It's, it's a reality, and, and if I was telling 12 months ago that we were well positioned because we had the know-how, 
we had the skills, we had engineers, now 
I can tell you that I have the customers and as those customers… And I have this project and very soon I have the sales and the margin. 
And for that growth, we have the Spanish government. 
We have the Spanish government that confirms that they want to help us to grow and put us back to where we were in 2019. That's the message. 
So those, those are the four main reasons why I'm 
positive and why I'm telling you that we are well positioned to grow and go back to what is more important to a real benefit, 
you know, to real profit. 
We are talking about… We're, we're, we're talking about awards. 
Why I'm positive of awards. And I think this is like, I think, I think it's, it's, it's, it's a good one. 
This one is one of the ones that I really like. It, it's, it's it's a good one. It's one, it's one of the ones that I really like. 
What with the, of all business is really difficult to measure on, on, on quarterly sales. We've done it. 
We've done it and we, and, and this is like what see with the quarterly sales started 2017 that we were having in this business. 
And in there, obviously we have an average of way above $1 billion Euro. 
You know, I mean having, you know, sales of $1.2, $1.3, very high level of sales. 
Way above $1 billion. One point… very good. Awards. 
I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm saying sales but awards. Obviously, 
that simple. We're getting awards. If 
pandemic came, and you see that at especially over 2020, 20, and early 2021, the level of awards. Were near practically nothing. 
And if you see now where are we today, what are the level of awards that we getting, and we getting now these large first quarter, very important last six quarters. 
If we back to our best years of awards. 
To our very best years of awards. 
So we're back on the market. But, uh, when we getting awards with old customers, new customers, very much is, you know, 
very much welcome inaudible. 
Very well positioned in that. And, uh, and then analysis of the jobs. Very healthy the risk. 
And let's, let's do an analysis of those awards. 
This is, this is an old slide. 
It has been, you know, putting in green all the jobs 
that originally… two quarters ago was presented to you in the job site we thought we could be awarded to us. 
Not they were awards, but that we were well positioned. 
Either because we were selected by customers, but not award, 
or because we thought in the competition, we is not strong enough. I mean, and that it we were only competing and the likelihood of us is quite high. 
If you go to all of them, the ones in red are the ones we've lost. 
And we had put with no color, uh, previous presentation, 
that we got them. You see here are $4.7 
billion Euros of awards. $4.7 billion with new customers. 
Uh, in a, in a market which is very important. Very much focused in gas and petrochemicals. 
Which are they're gonna grow and we're gonna grow with that market. 
And with everybody understands now that it's a big, big mismatch between supply and demand of gas and petrochemicals. And we're there. 
We're there with an old customers and with the new customers. 
And what likely in the few weeks, we'll have good news. We do expect that some of the jobs that we're very well positioned 
for the end of the year and first half of next year will, will, will happen soon. 
So this is, this is what I told you before, that it could happen. And it has happened. This is very important. 
So that's, that's why I like to, 
I don't, I don't… it's a bit complicated, it's like. 
And this is a trend of awards that have occurred, give or take, as we've announced to the market that could take place. 
So let's go to the next slide. Which give us an analysis of the backlog. 
In an analysis the backlog, which justifies and explain why I say that we're back to benefit, we're back to a healthy level of sales. 
We have a backlog that 42% of the backlog, all, of we program jobs. 
That we are negotiating with the customers to start again. And to start soon. 
That's, that, puts us late in sales into 20, into ' 22. 
35% is another $4 billion, give or take, of new products. 
Some of them have already come into force, and some other we are already works, have been awarded. We started with engineering, so far they have not come fully into force. 
And they are starting to come into force 
and we start finishing engineering and move into inaudible in sales. 
And sales, which are taking inaudible. A, and it will be back in a profitable inaudible. 
And 23% of the $3 billion of, of, of, of jobs 
that are, that are, that have been executed on the very much, most of them in infrastructure. 
The ones that were engineering is easy to manage. Very easy to manage a job if, if it was non-engineering job. 
Engineering companies have manage to many well the uh, the uh, the uh moving to a non inaudible engineering. 
But if you have to manage construction it was a different story. And, and fortunately, we work very heavily at 
that. And with this inaudible, I think we're, I'm very comfortable to say that these sales ramp up, you know, due to, uh, we program jobs and new sales 
is, is 
done this year. 
And therefore we're back into a profitability. 
With a good bite length. So let's talk about reality. Let's talk about we already stand. 
And now let's talk about, you know, the little bit that everybody wonders. What, what is <unk> strategy in this… energy position. 
I can hear the message, and I don't want to go through all, all those lines, you know, go forever. 
And I'm, I'm not good at it, is that today we can confirm that we starting to be, that we are a relevant actor in this transition. 
We have real projects, and you, and real customers. Not only, you know, not, not, not only proposals, that we have real projects. 
With GDynamic, with Swiss Bank, with inaudible, 
with Repsol, with inaudible, within our grasp we have real projects and we becoming a real actor in this transition. 
So we've done this and accomplished it. Let me tell you. 
When management had to focus on managing profit, had to focus managing jobs, had to focus in trying to collect from customers. 
So in this transition we has, we have placed ourselves and positioned ourselves very close already to, of, of a profitable business. 
And we move a step forward. And that step forward is now we, we want to be, and we are proactive. It's to be proactive in this market. 
We know as we sit in with customers, we know as we've been in, with infrastructure funds and helping and supporting them. 
And there is money. There is money that our customers and ourselves, we need to capture. 
And we put in together an strong and aggressive strategy. 
A strategy, trying to design with customers how to inaudible their industries and their plants. 
Sitting with customers and sitting with uh, with uh, with new companies in developments, doing ammonia low inaudible shipping. 
Technology. 
Sitting with customers, and sitting with the infrastructure fronts 
in developing technologies that are helping with technologies monetarize inaudible. 
And obviously sitting with customers, old customers and new customers, and fronts, in developing the technology of the, the inaudible. 
You know, uh, technology. You know, trying to develop with the, some new and fresh companies. 
Because they're to get probably the bright idea and got inaudible. 
So the action we're taking is very proactive activity, we have a structure of sales we have a very strong divisions. 
And the message and I'm quite sure that we, we can, 
we want, and we will be very important catalyzer, you know, to develop these technologies. So I'm, I'm, 
I'm truly positive that very soon, and sooner than later, it will be a very important division of GR. 
And now let's talk, everybody's wondering, you know, the fourth reason why I'm positive. I'm positive because we have the support of the Spanish government. 
And the support of the Spanish government, and back what it was in 2019 
when I was ready to capture a market and have a inaudible of above $5 billion Euros. 
So, you know, inaudible, she's inaudible in the Spanish government 
through the, uh, supports scheme. And what with the help of the European Union, 
you know, confirms that we strategic for the Spanish family and supports us. 
And supports us with $175 million of inaudible equity, 
uh, uh, loan and with another inaudible loan of $165 million. 
And we do expect that as we are working very closely day to day with the Spanish government, that those funds will be dispersed, you know, before year 
end. So it's good news. You need the balance sheet, you need the strength, 
you need give comfort to investors 
and customers, and, and, uh, and, and you need a backup. And we've got it already. 
So that, that was the fourth reason why, you know, we are well prepared to go back to profit. 
And this translate in inaudible. 
Obviously we are 15th of November 
and on 15th of November I cannot say that we gonna, you know, this is gonna happen include, include, in, in, in a few weeks. 
I mean, nothing is happening few weeks. That is why I'm giving to you a guidance of we are given from now to the end of the year. 
With sales we just come to be in the neighborhood of $3 billion. We've, if, if, if you cannot accrued 
an new backlog, if you cannot accrue it because you still sitting with the customers, 
then we program jobs. Obviously you cannot, it is not just editing sales yet, and you cannot, it will not translate in margins. 
In 2, ' 21, 
it will definitely translate into margins. You know, as we move forward into ' 22. 
The first quarters, 
at it's lower pace, which much stronger pace to the end of the year. Which will give us an average margin above 2%. 
An average sales year of above $2 billion. 
So that means, you know, a new award. 
That's true, I mean, it's not a challenge for me. I don't think it's too challenging having, you know, again, repeating awards of another $4 billion. 
So, uh, that's the guidance for 222. 
Is not, it's not a, it's, it's, it's not a, it's not that challenging. It's doable and we'll see the progress of these guidance as we move forward, you know, towards the second, third, and fourth quarter of the year. 
And obviously you might be wondering, at what, where will you go forward. You know, as, as, as you get the new awards of, you know, and move forward with stabilize the business 
on a sales figure of $5 billion. We had it before, awards of $5 billion, we've done it before. And that means the market and the pipeline is much stronger 
and far more demanding today than it was in 2017, ' 18, and ' 19. Much stronger. Far more, far much stronger. 
And it, and, and let me tell you. And, and probably less risky. Less risky because of the pace of the demand. 
And an, and an average edit above 4%. 
You might be wondering if I'm, and if I'm being, uh, you know, stingy, mean, or too prudent. Well, you 
know, we've, the level of uncertainty's still is great. I've been managing this business for 20 years. 
And I think it's prudent to say that uh, about 4% margin is doable. But I would not like to give 
guidance uh, above that. 
You know, the, the uh, the uh, it's true that we have new awards that have a good margin embedded. 
But uh, but uh, I think 223 is really far too long. And 
I think, 
I'm done. This is my last slide. They have taken me, well, 25, close to 30 minutes. I wanted to do in 20. 
But, uh, now, you know, any questions you may pose, you know, with inaudible answer them. You know, and give some color 
to this presentation. 
I'll answer them the better I can. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, the Q&A session starts now. So if you wish to ask a question, please dial 0-1 on your telephone key pad. 
Our first question comes from the line of Alejandro Vizio from the Sevier Securities. Please go ahead. 
Yes, hello Juan and inaudible. Thank you for taking my, my questions. 
And, a couple of questions to start, at least. Question one is about the mid-term, uh, target of guidance of $5 billion Euros and 4% inaudible. 
Which is the inaudible for this, for this kind of, uh, business environment. 24 months, eh, more than that, yes, 
yes. And, and, and the kind of, what kind of mix are you expecting in this, in these sales? In the inaudible in the transition projects? 
I don't know, 15, 20, 30% of uh, of a total? 
That would be the first one. And, and the second one is, um, about the inaudible financial support. 
The final number is bigger than, than the one announced in July. W-w-why is that, and, and second is, in the, in the same is common about the, 
uh, potential, um, equity commendment by, by inaudible in case of a capital increase. If you, if you can elaborate on, on that. 
Is inaudible your uncle investor for a potential, uh, capital increase? And when could this, uh, be executed? Thank you. 
Let me go one by one because I think you're asking all the questions that everybody wants to hear with, with your three questions. 
Alejandro, thank you. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you for your questions. First question, mid-term guidance. 
I mean, I'm talking about 
inaudible at, at, at the pace that we get in the new and fresh backlog, the quality of the backlog. And, and bringing forward, 
you 
know, uh, uh, the uh, the uh, all those jobs that had been reprogrammed. 
You know, you know, if, if the number of 223. 
I mean, we have to target a 223 to go back 
two numbers and two margins. That-… to numbers and to margins, that is different inaudible. And, uh, and, and, and, and that's the guidance, is that inaudible to ' 22, ' 23. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Thank you. 
The ni- The inaudible of energy transition, I think the energy transition, 
you know, there's gonna be… it- it's gonna have an impact that is truly weaker, but it's, it, it, it's not gonna be a volume business. There's gonna be very much… 
It, it, it's gonna impact in terms of margin, I don't know how much, small, 10%, 15%. 
It would allow us 
to improve the margin, but it's going to be very much a service business as a inaudible the customer inaudible at, at everything having to do with new technologies, new projects. 
It cannot be structured as an EPC, you know, inaudible It 
cannot, you cannot. I mean, you, you, you cannot put a, a price on a new technology having to do with, uh, 
hydrogen or inaudible So it 
will be either cost plus or sales. 
So it would allow us to manage the business, to develop our engineers, to catalyze the business and improve our margins, as you see, you know, profit and low level of sales, 
but it would would not signify a large percentage of sales. 
Probably, you know, you will see an improvement of the margins as we start rendering good services related to this project. 
inaudible was 340 and not 290 we have had before. 
You know, 290 was, you know, you know, in, in July, we decided to make it public and we decided, with our governments, to make it, to make it pu- public. 
That was the number we were analyzing. That was the number that we were analyzing and we needed, that was the best number we could come out to to put us back where we were before, 
because we wanted to be back equity wise where we were before. 
And, and for the same reason that the virus and the different variants are live, 
we announced we were doing, you know, 
very much with, uh, inaudible it seemed like a good number was not 290, it was closer to 240. 
You know, those things were alive, were alive, cost had been alive. 
You know, we have, we have gone through extra cost, and therefore, the number has grown and has been this since the time of inaudible So 
it's, it's a, 
it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's an analysis, so they're like the two last figures, cost with virus, and then government support. 
Yeah, equity conversion 
as the catalyzer, it had nothing to do with our equity conversion, or we had to do with the catalyzer. 
It is… You know, we have, we're gonna inaudible as a inaudible with a hybrid for four years, 
hybrid inaudible for four years, we have talked, 
when we talk to customers, and we have talked to customers in other September, October and November. That is good, 
that is good to seek inaudible of the government 
and here what we have is the option in the near or future, more likely in the future term. Once we pay back, 
once we're back by all means where we were before to continue having a government partner 
with a small percentage, with a small equity, 
because some of our competitors have it. 
It's because the thing that, commercially speaking, may count as a lot. 
Especially in a, in a, in a, in a, in a world that, um, that is changing extremely rapidly. 
And we have competitors in France, competitors in Italy, competitors in Korea, comp… You know. 
And it's an option. So it's an option that we have today, and we don't want to have it in, in four year times. 
And it's, it's a good option that we get from, uh, from the government 
to support the growth, uh, of inaudible, if we happen to need it. 
You don't, you don't, you don't solve any inaudible with $35 million, but it give us the health and the strength of having the support of this inaudible government. 
Let me tell you, many of our customers, you know, appreciate that. 
Okay. So, so this is just, um, sorry to, to follow on this, 
it's, it's not that you are planning, you know, um, a capital increase, it's just an option in the long term for SEPI to, to be part of this potential, uh, capital increase? 
It is, it is, it is obviously the fund, the pure fund has to go to hybrid. 
But if we have to, and, and, and as per the terms, we have to and we're planning to, and we're quite comfortable that it will be paid back in four years, 
as I, as I explained before. 
But, but we have… we like to have the option and then government agrees to it to continue having SEPI as a fund. Okay. crosstalk we do, we lose credibility, and it put us in similar position 
to some of our competitors. 
All right. Understood. Thank you very much. 
And the next question comes from the line of James Thompson from JP Morgan. Please, go ahead. 
All right. Uh, good afternoon, Haan. Thank you very much for your, uh, presentation there. I just, I have another question, but just, just following off on, uh, uh, inaudible um, questions there, 
in terms of the 35 million, uh, 
commitment, I mean, is, is this what you're saying is that this would be only decided at the end of the four and a half years? 
And, um, will it only happen if you also at the same time do, do some sort of capital increase at that time? 
Um, so I just wondered if you could conver- confirm that that is just, uh, right at the end of the period type decision, firstly. 
We just inaudible We have an idea when are we gonna convert it, if ever. But, uh, we have four years. 
Okay. It could be months, or it could be in four year time. 
But, uh, today we are… we haven't got inaudible in our structure but it's very well known we're gonna have it. 
And let me tell you, it's, it's, it- it's quite nice and healthy to visit our customers, 
and you have to go through how many awards we've got in August, September, October and November. 
And we, we came to the conclusion, they could be good. 
Could be good, we don't know. Le- Le- Let's see what happens to continue having them as a shareholder. 
Small shareholder, but it's a shareholder. If I give some color, 
yeah, uh, just 
inaudible the sort of customers that we have to serve, huge- mm-hmm <affirmative>. national oil companies, and, uh, and, uh, very often, they're requesting public finance, structural finance, export finance. Well, it 
I think w- it- it- inaudible but 
it's not very well developed. 
We thought it could give some color to inaudible balance sheet. 
Okay, okay. Thank you. Um, yeah, my question really was, I just wanted to talk about this kind of in- uh, y- you know, firstly, improvement in margins. 
You know, when you were giving the presentation, obviously, you know, four and a 
half billion euros of projects there or thereabouts are obviously, or have been reprogrammed, uh, or stopped and now need to be restarted. 
Um, so, I mean, I guess the question is, how have you… or what confidence can you give us that, that, that, that inaudible has managed to, um, negotiate to offset things like inflation 
and e- that we're facing at this point in times in these projects? You know, what sort of confidence can you give us that 
these four and a half billion are actually going to be able to generate margins as you head into kind of later part of 2022 and into, 
into 2023? 
And, you know, alongside that, you know, maybe you could give us a bit of a flavor, in terms of kind of the working capital side of things, or, or how cash has progressed. I mean, if this is the case that these projects have stopped, 
and are now restarting, um, so, you know, probably quite a long way from potential milestone payments, 
um, is it sort of fair to assume that, you know, we shouldn't really see much of an improvement in net cash until kind of 2023 type timeframe? 
Or maybe just some color about how you think that may well evolve 
over the coming quarters, that would be great. Thank you. So obviously, 
I mean, we are reprog- we are sitting in, in this space with all the customers, customers for projects 
in Asia, customers for projects in Italy, customer for 
projects in North America. 
And in… with some of them, we have already reached agreements 
with a embedded cost, and the embedded cost which has been transferred to them, obviously has to do with the inflation, has to do with material, has to do with extra cost of having to, 
uh, reprogram again and launch the job. 
With others, we're very close, and with others, we're just beginning, because we've just been announced that they like to sit with us. 
And, you know, it's… And, and it's, and it's for… So let me, let me tell you, it's much easier to sit down with a customer in today's market, that w- you have a real job, and that has been reprogrammed to their benefit. 
It's much easier to sit down with them and see how you can accelerate that job, 
and, and, and, and, and, and negotiate a contract or some payment terms, milestones and cost, 
you know, that it would, than, than, than going to the market and trying to bid for a new, for a new job. 
You know, this is something that both customer, I'm not gonna name it, and supplier inaudible have to sit down and agree. 
And I'm quite confident 
that in some cases, I already reach an agreement inaudible and some others, sooner than later, we will reach an agreement and accelerate. But, 
uh, but, but, but that's… You know, it's a, it's a, you know… 
Having reprogrammed jobs and having to restructure yourself with an 
un- you know, with, with, with a program, with an unwanted problem that we had, 
now all we do, we have another problem that we have to sit down and we renegotiate with them. But it's w- you know, it's, it's, it's a bit of 
both. It's a, it's an easier solution. 
And we happen to be successful, and we will 
reprogram jobs and 
new jobs come into force will translate into far better working capital towards the second half of next year, 
o- o- o- o- you know, a- as year was before. 
Um, okay. So sort of second half of next year, I mean, that seems relatively, uh, relatively quick, I suppose, if you've got kind of eight million if you include the new projects sort of just starting up now. 
I mean, you have to realize, this project, this project has been awarded from a… from being awarded, 
you have to, you know, have to… y- y- you know, you have to… they have to come into force. When the first comes into force, it's a inaudible engineering inaudible impact. 
But you start engineering in terms of working capital very little, because you are inaudible driven. And as, 
as you move forward, you start reaching milestones, 
you have to place orders and it translates into a far better working capital structure, 
you know, a- a- a- a- on that, on that is a very inaudible job. 
And the same is gonna happen with the jobs that we reprogram that we take to the customers, to see how to… Anyway. 
That's why I say, it's quick money, it's quick. We've been starting to work with them in October, and I'm talking about second half of next year. It takes eight, nine months. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Okay. 
Thank you very much, Haan. Appreciate your answers, and thanks for the presentation. 
Sure. I'll hand over. And the next question comes from the line Francisco Rues from Exen. Please, go ahead. 
inaudible Uh, I have, um, two questions. The, the first one is, is, is still on, on the cash position. 
So do, do you think that with the current cash and, and inaudible have just said, talk about in the second, uh, half of, of next year, 
will be enough to, to finance the, uh, strong inaudible that you're gonna have, with the four billion sales next year, five billion sales, 
uh, on the following? Or could b- be… would be easier to make a, a capital increase right now in order to be more comfortable to finance, uh, this expansion? 
Um, and the second question, if you could tell us, uh, if you have any significant impact from this scarcity of, of material due to the, the cycles, or how you are gonna deal with the raw materials inflation for the… in the coming quarters? 
Okay. Thank you, uh, Francisco. 
That decision, obviously will get into inaudible of cash, no liquidity, cash, pure cash. 
And I think that put us in a very comfortable position to manage the growth in inaudible and sales. 
It's good, and that's, that's the analysis. That's why we've inaudible set up from, uh, 290 towards 340. 
So that's it, and that's why I think the full point that g- gives us the comfort, 
that today, I had the awards, new awards are coming, and I'm back with a worse, you know, with a huge backlog at the end of, uh, 2019. 
So well, if the answer is, is this enough to achieve the year 2022 guidance? The answer is yes. 
Inflation of raw materials. 
Uh, you know, I- I'd show you the backlog. Uh, the backlog is, is, you know, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, all jobs, the ones that were impacted, 
there is no inflation of raw materials around the construction. 
The ones that, that, uh, that I- that are being awarded that just seem fine, and, and, and there is no impact, or very little impact of raw materials. 
And obviously, in some o- in, in, in, in, in, in and the jobs that have to deal with structure or that have to be, uh, 
renegotiated, there is impact, that were sleeping, one by one, customer by customer. Didn't have that many customers, and there are not that many jobs, 
to a- to accommodate-… and many jobs to, uh, to accommodate, you know, inaudible. You have to realize, you know, that some of the- those jobs, equipment was already bought. 
And the equipment was bought. And they are being preserved in the site. 
And some other bought materials, which is something you buy at the very beginning, was bought. And some equipment was bought. 
And then, you know, inaudible was, was brought. 
So, uh, even, even in the inaudible jobs, a very large percentage of the impact in raw material was already, you 
know… It was part of job. It was already paid or was already agreed, was already closed or hatched. 
And the remaining one, now, we're speaking with the customers to see inaudible. Okay. inaudible 
thank you very much. 
The next question comes from the line Kevin Roger from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. 
Um, yes. Good evening. Um, I would ask two questions. The, the first one is inaudible um, um, because 
you are guiding inaudible for something like 900 million, uh, euro for inaudible more than 3 billion revenue in Q4. 
I was wondering if you can give us some metrics inaudible to confirm the 
recovering, you know, activity because you were mentioning during the presentation numbers, people that, are, um, confined, isolated, under quarantine, et 
cetera, et cetera. So, can you share with us, some metrics in, like, say, this week, uh, compared to uh, to two months ago to, to show what is the trend in your, uh, activity right now? 
And the second question… Sorry for that one, but um, 
I mean, you have been ta- talking about a nice backlog, good quality backlog, et cetera since quite few quarters now. 
Um, when you look at 2022, you are guiding for 2% EBIT margin. So, far away from what you, you were expecting previously. 
Um, so, what do you… Did you include in this 2% EBIT margin? Uh, what is inaudible what are your main assumption for this 2%, please? Hi, 
Kevin. 
You know, you're talking about metrics. And 
I think in the presentation, the, the reason that I give you an example of one single job where we had to manage reduction 
uh, from 20,000 to 5000 workers 
with, uh, you know, 6000 workers under quarantine, that's one job. 
And do an analysis? I don't think I'm gonna start naming the different jobs that we have in the Middle East inaudible situations. 
So, it's very difficult to come out with metrics. 
This is the real metrics. And the important metric is we managed that. 
And we managed that, and we are successfully progressing in those jobs. And we are successfully delivering those jobs. 
That's the important about these metrics. 
And it, it's very different to uh, 
to come out with the real figure of a inaudible basis in this business. And it has been extremely difficult for us to inaudible gonna happen. 
So, the metric for guidance of 221 is that this whole thing is past 
or is passing, and that, uh, our jobs are progressing at a adequate pace. 
And our customer, we're negotiating with them to accelerate milestones inaudible getting paid. 
So, uh, that allows me to say okay, obviously, I have six months to finish the year. 
And with those metrics, I can finish this next quarter, you know, at a break-even basis. 
And thi- and this is the important thing. And inaudible Kevin, my message, it is a positive break-even. 
I mean, it's positive to finish at break-even with sales level as low as we've got. 
So, it's uh, uh, it's… Take it, or at least I take it, as good news. 
Some analysts may not like it because there are inaudible euros way above or below. 
But this is, this is good news. We've managed it, this business, under incredible uncertainty and stress. 
And we've managed it extremely well inaudible well. This is, this is good news. 
And the second, and the second question is, yeah, quality of the backlog, the quality is very good. 
And the margin embedded in the backlog is good. 
But the sales figure would not increase inaudible you know, in the, in the next… In the last two quarter of 221 
inaudible we cannot go to four. 
It will increase little by little. Our sales will increase. And we are inaudible the new jobs. They have to come into force. 
To give you an example, inaudible job that was awarded to us. And it's gonna be bigger than, than announced because there are a lot… We've already announced there are, there are a lot of 
uh, uh, options that have to be included, uh, as the customer, 
you know, works with the other engineering companies. 
You know, it's, it's… We are getting paid starting of inaudible fully into force because all the option have to be, 
uh, ha- have to be precisely inaudible into the contract. 
So uh, the inaudible job came into force, you know, at the end of September. 
So uh, you have to, you know… Jobs take a while to come into force. They're are good jobs. They're good projects. 
But I will, will not able to inaudible those jobs their embedded margin. And let me tell you, they are good margins inaudible the risk 
until, you know, second half of next year. So, it's gonna take a while. 
The good thing is we've got it. We have the backlog. And uh, QR franchise has remained as, as strong as before with, with a good level of awards. 
Okay. crosstalk me, Kevin, but I try my best 
<laugh>. <laugh>. inaudible thanks a lot for that. Thank you. 
And we have one question left from Alvaro Lenda from Elantra Equities. Please go ahead. 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. 
Um, first on, on guidance, you're looking for, uh, 5 billion awards, uh, midterm. 
If I am not mistaken, you've only reached, uh, such an amount one year. What, what makes you confident that you can 
reach these inaudible you stated that, uh, energy transition contracts will likely come with a lower size, but higher margin? 
Uh, so, that would be my first question. Second one 
is regarding the, um, the agreement with Seppi. 
On the release, it says that, uh, uh, you have committed to do inaudible kind of strategic plan that includes, uh, energy transition, diversification in, in, in different geographical regions, and uh, uh inaudible one. I, 
I wanted to know whether this r- refers to the Transforma inaudible plan that is already in place, or whether you are working on another strategic plan with, with uh, Seppi. 
And lastly, 
um, if, if we look at the net cash position, it has reduced by roughly 180 million quarter and quarter while the increasing working capital 
has only explained about 150. So, there is a, a big difference. And I understand that those 90 million that you stated, that was just uh, 
a one day difference between collecting and not collecting it. 
That would be already included in the working capital. 
So, other than the working capital, uh, the, the reduction in cash seems significantly higher than your net loss. 
So, whether you could provide some more color on whether you are paying some of the provisions that you've done during the year, or what explains this decline in the, in the net cash position? Thank you very much. <silence>. 
Okay, Alvaro. So sorry to keep waiting, but I think it's, you know inaudible I'm trying to organize how to answer 
you because um, you know, you know inaudible. The first one, you asking, you know… 
M- you know, you're talking about our Transforma plan and uh, our project with Seppi or strategy with Seppi, whether it's the same or not. 
I'm not sure what the question is. So, let me tell you. Transforma plan is something we worked very hard in 
2019, continued work in 2020 and, and 2000- two- 20. 
And our agreement with Seppi, obviously, Seppi liked it. Obviously, we liked it. 
And, and, and in our strategy with Seppi, everything that we had working on Transforma plan is alr- already inaudible. But it's 
no difference between Transforma and Seppi. 
I mean, Transforma is the plan of QR, you know, being able inaudible to grow and to become a far more cost effective company. 
And at the same time, provided that in- that, that we have some auditors, how we could capture inaudible risk part of the business, 
capture some other markets and the risk part of the business. 
It's not an obligation. It's a good plan. And it's a plan that we had before and we have improved inaudible Seppi as we always do. That's the natural way of managing a business. 
The second question, you were talking about guidance, guidance of the $5 billion inaudible. 
Obviously, if you crunch numbers, we have awards, and they come into force this year, above 4 billion inaudible 4 billion. 
And we have, uh, awards. 
Only, we have awards slightly above 4 billion. 
Next year, by the time inaudible accrued, we're gonna be reaching 5 billion inaudible sales. 
You know, it's, it's, it's just a inaudible 
you know, o- o- o- only with the, with the remaining backlog and the awards. So, 5 billion inaudible levels awards, 5 billion, 
we're gonna be very, very close, if not above. 
We've done it before. 
And we've done it before for several periods. We have the backlog to do it. 
Just, just you only have to look at the level of sales that we had at the end of 2019 
and try to play with those number, and to see what w- had been our level of sales with that backlog in 2020. 
It would've been… And that's what I said many months ago. We have put the business… 
We've organized some sales for business, for a level of sales w- way above 4 billion. 
So uh, it is a guidance, but it's a guidance that I do feel comfortable to reach. 
And the last question has to do with the falling cash, 90 million, falling working capital. I'm a little confused. 
So, all I can tell you, those 90 million, they're… It's a down payment that should have come in to, you know, during the month of September. 
And for some reason inaudible came in on the 1st of October. 
So, I think it's part of, yeah, working capital. It's just a 
90 million cash payment having to do with a down payment of a job have, that has just started. 
But uh, but uh, if, if, if you want to get into detail in numbers, I would advise to you to call, you know, our investor relations, and then uh, you get into details 
because uh, probably, I'm not the right person to give you uh, the best 
and detailed answer. But thanks a lot, Alvaro. 
Thank you very much for the color. 
And as there are no further audio questions, I'll hand it back for any closing remarks. 
Okay. Uh, thank you, thank you to all of you for listening to the, to the uh, presentation, a bit longer than expected. 
I tried rush, but I was not able to. 
And thank you for all the, uh, questions, which we do inaudible you know, which should help us be me, in particular, to inaudible presentation. 
Thanks a lot. And I'll see you, 
for sure, in a few months' time, February.
