Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MTN Ghana 2019 annual results call. 
All participants will be in listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference. 
If you should need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by pressing star, then zero. Please note that this call is being recorded. 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremiah Opoku. Please go ahead, sir. 
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss MTN Ghana's annual results for the year ended 31st December 2019. 
I am Jeremiah Opoku, Investor Relations Manager for MTN Ghana. 
With me on the call today are Selorm Adadevoh, CEO of MTN Ghana; 
Modupe Kadri, former CFO of MTN Ghana; 
and Kobina Bentsi-Enchill, acting, acting CFO for MTN Ghana and Group Investor Relations. 
Selorm will provide you with an overview of the company's performance for 2019 and outlook for this year 
before we move on to the Q&A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call operator. 
With that, over to you, Selorm. 
Thank you, Jeremiah. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making time to join us on this call today. 
I will provide a brief overview of our performance for the year ending December 2019 
and speak a little bit about the outlook for this year, 2020, before handing it over to the operator for questions and answers. 
We're excited by the strong performance delivered by MTN Ghana, the team here, for the year 2019, 
and in a competitive industry while maintaining market leadership with 55% market share. 
And we grew service revenue 23% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in voice, data, and Mobile Money. 
Voice revenue was up in the double digits, an increase by 19% year-on-year, supported by growth in our active subscriber base, 
continued improvements to our network, and the impact of various customer value management initiatives and pro-customer activity, 
which encouraged increased usage of our services by our customers. 
The contribution of voice revenue to overall revenue edged down from 45, to 45% from 46%, 
as expected, as new lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional voice business. 
Data revenue growth was strong at 33% year-on-year and was attributable to the higher number of active data subscribers and smartphone users on the network, 
as well as an increase in data usage across our customer base. 
Data contributed 28% to total service revenue, up from 26% in 2018. 
Mobile Money revenue also contributed on a strong 
tra, on a strong trajectory, increasing by 28% in a year in which we marked its 10th anniversary in Ghana. 
The growth in Mobile Money was driven by the ongoing expansion in the number of active subscribers 
and the increased transactional activity, as well as good growth in advanced services. That's retail merchant payments, 
pensions, remittances, as examples. 
Mobile Money made up 19% of our overall service revenue, compared to 18% in the prior year. 
Turning to EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, 
this grew by 66% with a year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion of 13 percentage points to 51% on a reported IFRS view. 
When comparing the like for like IAS 17 basis, our EBITDA margin increased by 4.8 percentage points to 42. 5%. 
If we further normalize for management fee, then like for like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 percentage points to 43.5%. 
The margin improvements were supported by tight controls on our operating expenses as well as distribution efficiencies. 
In terms of capex, we invested GH1 .1 billion in support of the growth 
in the core business and improving the participation of and quality of service to our customers. 
MTN Ghana acknowledges the outbreak of coronavirus worldwide and its potential impact on our supply chain. 
While we monitor unfolding developments, we're exploring multiple scenarios in a bid to mitigate the impact on our business. 
On the regulatory front, the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed, in May last year, into law. 
This governs the way Mobile Money services are conducted. As required of existing players such as us, we have duly applied for the new license. 
MTN Ghana maintains ongoing engagement with regulatory stakeholders 
with a firm focus of sustaining cordial relationships and achieving continued improvement in customer experience. 
Follow- following the expiring of certain technology licenses in 2019, the NCA regulator has renewed our TV license for 15 years. 
We have submitted applications for the renewal of our international gateway and fixed access licenses, which are pending NCA approval. 
We continue to invest in our communities with the MTN Ghana Foundation, and support reaching a total of 149 projects since inception in 2, in 2007. 
In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education, three in health, and one in economic empowerment. 
The board declared an interim dividend of two pesewas per share after reviewing the midyear performance of the company. 
After reviewing the full year performance of the company, the board shall, shall be recommending a final dividend of four pesewas per share, 
bringing the total dividend for 2019 to six pesewas per share. 
This corresponds, this represents 73% of profit after tax and a 20% increase in dividend per share. 
Before I comment briefly on, on prospects for the outlook, 
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some changes in our management, which Jeremiah touched on a little earlier. 
As you may be aware from our release to the market last week, 
our CFO Modupe Kadri, 
and executive 
director of MTN Ghana, has been appointed to the chief financial officer and executive director role of MTN Nigeria effective 1st March 2020. 
As a result, Kobina Bentsi-Enchill has been appointed to act as chief financial officer until the replacement process is completed. 
This process is underway, and we'll update the market once it's finalized. On this note, I would like to wish both gentlemen the very best in their new roles. 
In terms of the outlook for 2020, 
2019 marked the year of the customer for MTN Ghana. And in 2020, we're building on that foundation as we transition from a traditional mobile telecoms operator to an emerging digital operator. 
As a business, we're well-positioned for continued growth as we invest in ongoing improvements in quality of service in a drive to increase participation of Ghanaians in all our service offerings. 
In line with our, with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the year of the customer, the digital experience, with a firm focus on digital. 
The focus on digital is a tool to enhance customer experience, as well as create value for our shareholders. 
At this point, I'd like to hand over the conference call to the operator for questions and answers. Thank you very much once again. 
If you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one on your touch tone phone or on the keypad on your screen. 
If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star, then two to remove yourself from the list. 
Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one. We will pause to see if there are any questions. 
We have a question from Mangaliso Dlamini from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hi, everyone. This is Mangaliso Dlamini from JP Morgan. 
Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. 
Uh, two questions from my side. 
Um, one relates to the 2G license renewal. Could you provide some color as to how much the renewal costs, please? 
And secondly, on the Mobile Money services, 
with the change in legislation and application for the new license, is this a simple administrative tick in the box, or is there more to the process? 
Could you maybe just talk us through the process there, please? Thank you. 
Well, thank you very much for the question. 
Let me start with the 2G license. And the 2G license was renewed, um, at $25 million. 
This was an industry renewal, and both ourselves and, and Vodafone had this renewal, and the validity or the tenure of the license was 15 years. 
In terms of the MoMo process, the new, the new act, the PSSA, Payment Systems and Services Act, 
I believe the question was whether this was an administrative tick in the box for the regulator or whether there was something else behind it. 
I think the spirit behind the PSSA, two, two or three things here. 
Um, the first one is, in 2014, there was the EMI, which was the Electronic Money Issuer regulation that was passed, 
which allowed telcos to take more responsibility in 
managing agents and, and accounting for, for customers as a customer of the Mobile Money operator. 
Before that, it was actually bank-led fully, 
and therefore, those assets were essentially owned by the banks. 
The PSSA is intended to expand on this 
by allowing fintech, the broader fintech community beyond the Mobile Money operators to also have a framework under which they operate. 
That being said, and that allows some sort of regulation and oversight for the fintech community, does have an impact on the Mobile Money industry overall. 
But then the second thing was also, after the banking sector clean-up, was also to institute certain mechanisms that allow risk to be managed in a structured format, 
so that we can prevent a similar situation from happening within the Mobile Money or the fintech space. 
And then the third thing is really to strengthen the governance processes, um, with the Central Bank themselves, with the growth in Mobile Money over the last three to five years, 
and have had to update their own internal processes for better governance and an understanding of this space. So these would be the three main drivers. 
And but certainly, a positive, um, framework from our perspective in terms of enabling the environment and looking out for, 
um, a future that's going to continue to be dominated essentially by the mobile 
financial services 
and the fintech companies in terms of having managed financial 
services overall. 
Thank you. Our next question is from Preshendran Odayar from Nedbank. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. It's Preshendran Odayar. 
Um, just following up on, uh, Mangaliso's question. So, it sounds like, yes, that this new act is, is more encompassing, 
but do you as management see any, uh, roadblocks in terms of actually getting this license, or is it something that's, you've, you've kind of like, priced in? 
And a second question on the regulatory front was I, I read somewhere that in December, uh, you did get fined by the regulator for service disruptions. 
Um, can you give us an update on that? Has that all been resolved, or is it a once-off thing, or something that we can expect more of? Thanks. 
Thanks for your question, and I'll take the first question, which was, 
um, which was on the risks or any potential risks of getting the license. 
We don't actually foresee that to be, to be a major constraint. Obviously, we have to also be diligent in our submission, which we have done, 
and but we don't see any major roadblocks from where we sit at this stage. 
Um, the process will, will end in June, and, you know, if there are any changes, we'll update you through that. But we certainly don't see any risks-… any changes, we'll update you through that, but we, we certainly don't see any risks from our position currently. 
In terms of your second question, um, which was about the fine and, and whether that's all been resolved, 
yes, um, you know, we received a fine for a GH100 ,000 in December, following the implementation of, of new services. 
And that situation was resolved within 48 hours of, of us receiving the fine. Um, 
I don't believe that we can expect any other, any other fines, uh, in terms of the business. 
Oh, oh, sorry. So the fine was GH100 ,000 in total. It wasn't per subscriber or anything like that? 
No, it's 100,000 in total. That's correct, yes. 
Okay, no, thank you very much. The next question is from Moses Dzawu from Bloomberg. Please go ahead. All right, thank you very much. 
Um, my question is, uh, now, uh, telecoms are moving close- closer to higher, you know, uh, G's. 
Why would you still want to renew your 2G license? That's my first question. 
Uh, my second question, are you indicating that there is potential for the coronavirus to impact your supply chain? Please, please give us some more details. 
Uh, have you started, 
uh, getting any sort of impact, and, uh, if- if- if you talk about potential, in what form, uh, could it become serious? Thank you. 
Thanks for the question. Um, in, in terms of the 2G license and why we thought it was important to renew it, and just to give you some context, 
today we have approximately 40% smart phones on our network, 
which means we have 60% of our users today that do not have a smartphone and rely on 2G services. 
Now, in as much as, you know, smartphone users have a higher ARPU, you know, the 60%, even on a lower ARPU, is a very significant component of the business. 
So, you know, we, we really have no option, if we have to continue to grow the business forward, to renew the 2G license. 
However, we're also expecting that in the next couple of years, we should see universal access license, 
um, implemented by the regulator, 
which would mean that we can reappropriate the 900 and 1800 spectrum under the 2G for higher generations of technology. 
So, we have that in mind when we're looking at the renewal, 
and but we definitely didn't have much of a choice with the renewal since we have a huge dependency on- on- on 2G currently in terms of our base and the mix of smartphones. 
In terms of the coronavirus, 
um, you know, our measures today are- are- are proactive, and- and we're basically preempting a potential situation down the line. So, we haven't had any impact on the business currently, 
and but in anticipation of what may happen, uh, we're making sure we put in place the right processes to prevent any impact on the business going forward. 
The next question is from Jake Ward from Ashmore Group. Please go ahead. 
Hi. Thanks for the call, guys. Um, a couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, uh, given the strong growth in the voice ARPU, 
I wondered if you could just expand a bit more on some of the initiatives that have driven this, and your expectations for the business in 2020. 
Um, then secondly, des- despite the strong year-on-year growth, it looks like the Mobile Money revenue came in just a little bit softer in Q4, 
um, based on our numbers. Can you, can you just give some color on what drove that? Thanks. 
All right, thanks for the question. And the first one, I'll take the first one, which was around the voice ARPU, what the expectations are, 
um, for 2020 and some of the initiatives that- that- that supported the voice, the voice business. 
Um, so, we see the voice business as, as a business that's gone from, you know, being the most significant business to now, um, a business that we're managing forward. 
And so, by that, we're minimizing our above the line campaigns in terms of voice and doing a lot of below the line campaigns, 
which takes us into an area called customer value management, CVM. 
And so, what we basically do in terms of voice is look at profiles of customers 
and try to define specific products and services that's skewed to the specific behavior, based on 
the characteristics and the attributes of that particular segment or that particular user. 
So, this has been, I would say, the primary mechanism to manage voice, um, in order not to impact the growth in some of the newer areas, which have been mixes between voice and data users. 
In terms of the expectations for 2020, 
we have a very strong desire to continue to drive smartphone growth, so we will expect to see the mix of smartphone and- and- and non-smartphone changing in favor of smartphones. 
However, with the rate we've seen historically, we won't, we won't suddenly change the baseline for the non-smartphone users 
and would expect to see a reduction in that base, um, but continue to still be significant and strong. 
As such, the activities on CVM will continue, 
um, but the focus to drive growth and secure the future of the business will- will be largely driven by the smartphone base, 
what we do in terms of apps, MyMTN app, music apps, gaming, and things like that, 
um, as well as the enhancements in customer experience to ensure that we can drive more transactional activity. So, that will really be the focus for- for 2020. 
In terms of the MoMo performance, um, there, there were some changes in Q4 which impacted the year-on-year revenue growth, 
and the most significant of which is 
part of the- the PSSA meant that we- we, there was a change in how the interest 
revenue on- on MoMo float was distributed. 
And that change would have given us an additional… sorry. Without that change, we would have seen an additional 10 percentage point growth in MoMo. So, that was the primary driver of the drop. 
And the organic business continues to be very strong. 
We expect to continue to see that growth in 2020. 
That's great. Thank you very much. 
The next question is from Joyce Agbozo from Databank Brokerage Limited. Please go ahead. Hi. 
Thank you very much for this 
call. Um, my question relates to the cost efficiency that I see in the business. So, looking at the current figures that were posted, 
I noticed that, um, the costs declined or reduced significantly for some of the, or the major cost items. I want to know what drove that. 
Thanks for the question. I'll just, um, Modupe is on the line and he would, he would respond to that and the costs. All right, there is, um, hello. 
Thanks for the question. Uh, the cost efficiency is mainly, on both fronts, on the cost of sales. 
So, um, we were able to optimize our- 
our relationships with the international carriers, so we had a lot of savings on, uh, uh, incoming, uh, international calls. 
And then on the opex side, we also had some optimizations, reviewed, uh, various, uh, contracts that we had 
with the service providers and their leverage on our sites. 
So basically, what we've done is to optimally, uh, is to continue to try to optimize our operations, such that, uh, we gain from synergies going- going- going forward. 
Now, you're going to see much of that, uh, in the, in the coming period too, 
uh, to continue that. All right. 
Thank you very much. The next question is from Floris Steenkamp from Coronation. Please go ahead. 
Hi there. Um, I also have a, have a question on the, on payments license. Um, 
I think you briefly mentioned the changes in, in Q4, but I was just wondering, what are the main changes for your business under the new license? 
I mean, any 
services now that you can offer or can't offer, um, you know, or fees that you can charge or not charge? So just, uh, like, the main changes for the business. 
Um, and then secondly, also on the- the, 
what are the costs involved? Um, is there a once-off license fee or an annual, annual cost, um, related to this? 
And then, um, lastly, there were talks in the past of a 30% local ownership requirement for Mobile Money businesses. 
And I'd just like to hear your thoughts on- on what's the latest on this, and, 
uh, does this new license address that at all or is this still something that's- that's an issue? Thanks. 
Okay, thanks for the question. Um, so just very quickly on the first part, which was what were the main changes. 
Um, so, the two, the two significant changes in terms of the business, 
um, mind you, the core business, um, continues to run. There are no significant changes or no changes at all on the core business. 
Um, however, in terms of the interest on float, that's where the changes happened. 
So, before the changes in Q4, the float interest was split 80-20, uh, where 
20 goes to the operator, like us, and 80 goes to the customer. 
The changes there have been a reduction to the operator, so it's no longer 20% to the operator. It's now 10% to the operator and 90% to the customer. 
But also what has changed here is the interest on float, which is regulated by the Central Bank. 
And that number was 7% prior to Q4, and has been reduced to 4%. 
So the entire interest scheme has changed, uh, for the, for the, for the float earnings. 
Um, so these are the two main- main changes. 
However, on the operational side, in terms of the products we offer that we've built internally, there was no impact on that portfolio at all. 
In terms of the 30% local ownership, 
um, the PSSA has clarified the- the 30% ownership now, which was, 
which is, um, in terms of 30%, it's measured on the capital required to get the license. So, for us to be a dedicated EMI, which is called a DEMI, 
D-E-M-I, um, we need a minimum capital requirement of GH20 million. 
The local ownership is 30% of that 20 million capital required, which is six million for us. 
We're in the process now, um, to finalize that, 
but it's a pretty straightforward activity now than what had been suggested in the past. 
Our next question is from Douglas Holm from Deccan. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. 
Thanks for the, uh, the call. Um, 
I was wondering if you could just give us what the, uh, voice data, MoMo and digital revenues were for 2018 and 2019? 
Okay. Um, just bear with me one second. 
So, so, total voice revenue, um, I, I don't, I don't know if I got the last part, but total voice revenue was GH2 
.318 million, sorry, GH2 .318 billion. Um, 
data revenue is 1.461 billion, and Mobile Money revenue is 959 million. 
And, and what about the other digital revenue? Digital revenue, um, just bear with us one second 
if that's not in there. 199 million in terms of digital 
revenue. Okay. And then it looks like MoMo was down about 23% in the fourth quarter. Is that, is that what you guys have 
as well? Because we're, we're trying to back into a, uh, a fourth quarter number here. 
Sure. I mean, I, there was a question earlier on, you know, what drove the- the change in- in the MoMo trend from Q3 to Q4, 
and it's largely a change in the interest scheme, both on- on the float interest and the split between customers and operators. 
Right. So I guess the- the business, the- the peer-to-peer payments, the transactional payments, can you give us an idea of how much that grew year-on-year? So, 
most of the key lines, I mean, the Mobile Money drivers would be cash out revenue, as well as peer-to-peer revenue. Cash out is about at 60% 
and peer-to-peer is about 30%. And 
both of those are trending about the same rate as the total business of about 28% year-on-year growth. 
Gotcha. And then just in terms of the 30% local ownership requirement, 
um, you know, GH6 million of ownership, I would assume that the IPO al- already satis- In the-the IPO a-already satisfies that requirement? 
But that-that determination has not been made yet. We've submitted the application, and the central bank is currently reviewing that. So we'll get the response to um that in due course. 
But he has the six million, in terms of the value of the business um, It's quite- it's quite a small amount, So. 
We don't expect this to be a hurdle to achieving localization from the perspective of mobile money. 
And then, what was the management fee amount in 2019? 
K, so I just pass that to someone to pursue 
inaudible Okay, um, excuse me. Oh. The Management fee amount 
was 192 million, 
Okay, and then… gotcha, and then in the-a direct network costs, 
um, you know, they appear to the following year on year, but I believe part of that is just simply moving lease costs, 
um operating lease costs, out of the direct network operating costs, 
so um yeah, I guess is the 624 million, if you wanted to look on at, apples to apples, do you add 430 million for leased stocks? 
inaudible 
Just one last question, On kind of the outlook for-for 2020. 
I mean, can you guys give us some-some high level thoughts on you know, revenue growth by-by the major buckets, voice, data and, and um MOMO. 
We don't have that split, but our overall guidance is-is, you know to maintain our overall guidance, in the prospectus for year three. 
Okay, and what about um, what about margins? Well, without guidance, we should be, we should be… we should be tracking our guidance for margins as well. Okay. Great, thanks man! 
The next question is from Timothy Rushhook, From Ventura Capital. Please go ahead. 
Hey, guys, this is Ray five, for Tim. Um, I have quite a few questions. Uh, just starting out with mobile money. <unk> a couple that you mentioned in the past. 
Uh, the first one, I was just wondering what transactions uh, per user per month. Uh look like for 2019. 
Uh, and then, I guess total amount of remittances as a portion of mobile money revenue, or mobile money transaction volume. 
Um, what the yearly transaction value was for the mobile money product? And then, any updates on your subscriber market share? 
Alright, so I don't know if I can answer all of them immediately. But we'll certainly get back to the ones that I've missed. But let me… let me start with the transactions, per user, per month. 
And so the two… the two 
most popular transactions, which will be aligned with the revenues of this as well: the <unk> and cash outs, 
and it's typically five transactions on P-2-P and five transactions on cash out per user per month. 
In terms of cash, and it's very similar to P-2-P at 4.5 transactions per month. 
And these will be the three main transactions. The rest are really small transactions that are 
continuing to grow, We're seeing good growth in metal payments and bill payments, but the transaction frequencies are quite small. 
In terms of the update on the subscriber share, just to clarify, is that subscriber share in mobile money? Or is a subscriber share on the core business? 
Yep, I would say… I would take both subscriber market share numbers, both MOMO and then uh, 
core business. MOMO the core business. Okay, thank you. 
So in terms of our whole business, market share, 
we're 55.2% In terms of the core business, by the end of 2019. 
In terms of the remittance percent of total revenue, remittance of about 1.6% of total… of total revenue, 
and in terms of our model money, subscriber share, right about 74%. And I believe those will be the questions that you asked. 
Yeah, and then I-I just said a couple of follow ups. So one, that 74 is… last year, you were at 94. Right? So that's a significant drop. 
I guess what's… what has led to that 20% point change in market share? 
Okay, so just to clarify, um, the value the 94% you refer to, is actually the share of the total transacted value. 
Okay. And, On that basis, we're still above 90%. And 
the subscriber share has remained about the same in the… in the marketplace as well. So these are two fairly stable… stable numbers despite 
the 28% in growth in-in the business. 
I hope that clarifies… Got it. And then did you… did you give a number for um, yearly transaction value? 
I think… I think last year, your-your transaction value was 151. Or maybe 2017 was 151 billion CDs. Um, 
I don't think I have a 2018 number, but I was wondering what the 2019 transaction value is. 
Sure, we'll come back to you on that. And we just have to rely on the disclosures by the central bankers consistent, so we'll come back to you on that. 
Okay, sounds good. And then, last question. So just seeing the-the obvious, 
uh Operators split of, uh the interest off the flow come down, and then the interest rate that's being, you know, charged on their credits 
and that flow, 
is-is this something we're going to see in another part of the cycle, in four or five years and updated, um, another updated act, where that gets stripped down to, 
you know, the operators taking no share of interest income, off of the float? Is-is that where we're headed? 
No, I don't believe we will get to the point where there's no interest for operators. Um, 
I think this trend was really facilitated by trying to promote one more-more interest back to the consumers, which is where the 90% came in. Um, 
In terms of their… in the reduction in the interest rate itself. This is something that a central bank could manage 
in, and we've had quite a tough financial industry. There was a restructuring last year. So that's all driven by… sorry, that's the result of some of these activities. 
So, I don't expect to see major changes um, to these numbers going forward, but certainly not getting to zero interest. 
Got it. And then, just final question on um, subscriber growth for mobile money, 
uh it looks so… so active dada subs were 
up, I think 9.5% for the year, and then, 
oh wait… a-active… sorry, active mobile money subs were up 4.6% for the year, and then an overall mobile money subs were up one. 
Um, do you have any active view on an acceleration or deceleration subscriber numbers? And what… 
is the lever you're looking to pull here sort of, converting 
you know… the inactive subscriber to an active subscriber, or you further focused on monetizing? Is the actual subscriber growth kind of uh, 
you know, on the back burner now, and you're… you're more focused on the monetization of what you have? Or how do you think about that strategically? 
You know, you're absolutely spot on. 
I mean… Yeah, there was a bit of a focus on monetization, and launching more advanced services. 
Suddenly, we've-We've started this year on an acquisition drive, so we should see growth. We should see continued growth this year, as well. 
Got it. Awesome. Thanks. 
The next question is from Omar Shafey From EFG Hermes, please go ahead. 
Uh, yes. Thank you, thank you for taking the call. 
Um, So, please, could you name some of the existing partner banks, um, that you're working with on the MOMO wallet? Is my first question. 
Second question is: 
Um, does the payment systems and services act change the nature of these relationships? And if so, in what way? 
Uh, and then my last question is: on the reduction in the interest um, for float? 
Um, That's… that's come down from 7 to 4%. 
Is there a provision in the existing acts, that allows for revision upwards, Um, Should rate in the market change? Thank you. 
All right. Thanks. I'll- i'll have um, with the parents for the first two questions which are around the banking relationship. 
And then I will take the question on-on whether we expect um, another provision in the app that can a-affect the interest rates. 
So I'll start with a provision and I'll handle that and after that. 
in terms of the provision, there is no provision in the act itself and you know, the four, the 4% and the 7% are not governed by the act. These are no operational tactics, by the central bank. Um, 
So there wasn't a-a-a provision per se. 
However, these are… these are discussions we will continue to have with the central bank on trying to, to maximize the opportunity with interest moving forward. 
I'll hand you over to inaudible to handle the-the question on bank partnerships, 
and the implicationscrosstalk. You know 
that uh, the partner bank, remotely like changed, um, the guidelines, um, doesn't stipulate any changes. So we still maintain 
um, relationships with have with-with the partner banks, and um, also trying to increase that ecosystem as it were. Um, 
I'm not sure I got your second question, to be honest, the second question, if there was, please kindly repeat it. 
Yeah, so just I'm asking, um, I-I don't know if it's a long list, but if it's a short one, I'm just asking for the… you to name the partner banks that you work with on the MOMO wallet. 
Oh, we… we worked, pretty much um, with most of the key Banks, um, was named the echo bank, the GT Sansha Pretty much like a two partner 
method, um, that we're working with. Okay. Thank you for that. 
The next question is from Nitin Vault and from the Can Value Investors Please go ahead. 
Hi, guys, thanks for the call. 
Um, quick question to continue this discussion on this float, um, on the slow part of the business. 
Can you give us a sense of the total value of float generated by MOMO 
during the year 2019? And how did it grow versus 2018? 
Alright. Um, inaudible 
it looks fine for MTL was in excess of 3 billion CD. 
Um, healthy growth… just trying to get my numbers, uh… 
inaudible Yeah, so the slots inaudible to three CD, um, and at the end of 
November, and um, pretty much else, that flips on MTL Mobile money platform, 
as well, but like Simon did say we're waiting for the official figures to be published by the um, central bank. Um, but to pretty much be in that line… in line with what I have to say. crosstalk Uh, just a 
second, just trying to get the exact numbers for you. 
So the 3.4 billion as of December 2019, compared to 2.43 billion, uh as uh, the metric. 
Got it, got it. And typically, what is the duration of the float? How long does this float stay in, 
you know… If you put 100 Ghana CD on day one, how long before it goes, um, goes into the system again? 
What… um… 
Okay, so, 
very quick, I can answer the question. As long as uh, the subscriber has an electronic wallets, It mustinaudible for it to 
float. So, as long as those wallets exist, then the floats most represented by the cash. 
so the numbers we talked about, uh, the 3.4 billion series, are the cash value of the uh, electronic develop the electronic wallets. 
So how long it stays in ecosystem depends on what some of the things that I'm talking about, these transactions, how much able, to… within the ecosystem 
and how much actually inaudible. how much you're able to keep within the ecosystem and how much inaudible actually inaudible of the exo- ecosystem. 
But, um, given this numbers we gave, uh, that I just quoted, 2.43 billion as at the end of December, 2018, compared to 
3.4 billion as at, um, 
2019, just shows that, um, uh, the product is, um, it's, it's been, it's increasing because we've also created, uh, different, um, uses for the, for the inaudible in terms of what people produce on 
the ecosystem. 
So you have, um, increase in merchants, uh, merchant payment, uh, the agent footprint and things like that, 
um, that's actually fostering the whole Mobile Money Ecosystems. 
Understood. Understood. 
A- And, and, uh, the partnership with the banks, right? So, uh, so the increase that you get on the, on the float, 
you said it's going to be split 90, 10 now. 90 with the customer and 10 with, with you, uh, with MoMo. 
How, uh, how does the interest rate compare to the deposit rate that the customer would get if they just put the money in the bank? 
Okay. So two things. Currently for most people, if you, 
if you think, if you look at the mobile money wallet, uh, the physical current account, uh, where you currently 
earn zero, um, no interest on your balances on your current account. 
Um, then you will look at the mobile money for that as, uh, the next best thing because you could earn up to 4% or there about on your mobile money, uh, 
float. Um, so if you look at those two, which is the proxy for each other basically, it's either you have your money in your current account or your, or your mobile money wallet. 
So you have the ability to earn interest on one, whereas you have no ability to earn interest on the other. 
So that's how it's compares. Now as per the exchange… I mean as per the interest rate, 
the interest rate are calculated by the, by the bank, uh, the central bank, so they're kept low. 
Um, you know, they've got increased dialogue on that, with, with the industry so that we can, um, get more value for the subscribers. 
But at the moment, that's what it is. It's being regulated by the Bank of… uh, by the central bank. 
And, um, like Raju said, the whole objective is that 
those float or those money, uh, belongs to the subscribers, and as such, they should be remunerated accordingly. So what the new Payment Services Act has tried to do, 
is to inaudible that, um, i- in black and white 
at 90% of the, um, money generated on the float should be, um, uh, sent to the subscribers, and that's what we're doing. 
Next question is from Alina Serve from 
Virgin Asset Management. Please go ahead. I thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Uh, just a follow on, on the interest rate, uh, structure scheme. 
Uh, just curious whether you've seen any change and behavior, um, perhaps in, you know, uh, the incentives that maybe 
contribute to the wallet today. I, I, I, 
I hear Yuri talk about the investment between the current account and, and the wallet. But generally speaking, have you seen any change and behavior towards, uh, people contributing to the float 
via the wallet, 
uh, as a result of the change in inaudible Scheme? So that's the first question. Right. So, okay. If 
I could take that. I think, um, the, two ways you could look at that, 
one, the mere, the mere fact that your, your float balances are going from, um, 2.43 to three… Over a billion, more or less, 
um, in a year. That's almost about 50%. 
Um, shows that it's attractive to some. That's one. 
Two, most of the people in the Mobile Money Ecosystem are those who are actually on the banks, who probably could not have access to a banking account. 
So, um, having been brought into the, und- under the hospital of financial inclusion, 
um, obviously they could continue to invest in that activity or continue to partake in that activity. So 
I'm not sure it'll be right for us to compare, uh, like for like, 
because this, most of the, the, the, the bulk of this, the majority of this people were outside of the financial, um, uh, inclusion, uh, financial system. 
So I think, um, in as much as the float were growing due to the activities, 
um, that people can now do wi- on their mobile money, 
uh, wallet, I think you're gonna see that number potentially increasing. At what rate? I can't say. 
But I could, um, definitely say that, um, uh, the interest may not be the major driver of why people are coming to the ecosystem. 
It's more of the convenience and what they're able to achieve, 
um, with having a mobile 
money wallet. Yes. That's clear. Uh, the second question, uh, I- 
I think you alluded earlier on in the call to, um, value-added services inaudible um, and things that are outside of the P2P, 
uh, uh, transaction type. 
Can you talk about the percentage 
of value or percentage of transaction that's coming from, uh, value-added type services in, in, in the MoMo ecosystem? Question… 
The question was on what, what the, what's the contribution of the advance 
services in MoMo Money, is that correct? That's correct. Yeah. 
It's about 11%, in terms of, uh, in terms of the contribution. 
Is it safe to say that, that 11% carries a higher, uh, margin compared to kind of the traditional P2P inaudible? That's correct. Yes. 
'Cause a traditional business has- Okay, thanks. a commissions on cash in, which doesn't apply to this. So- mm-hmm <affirmative>. fair question. Okay. Uh, that makes sense. 
The last question, uh, is just on management 
inaudible. Uh, just reminds us the, does MTN Group charge any management fees on, uh, MoMo, uh, revenues or inaudible? 
Um, just wanted to get a sense of that. 
Well, a- a- a- at the time, we, um, submitted our application to the JIPC, 
um, also that is all, all, um, so the company revenues was the intent 
and that's what, um, that's what's in the guidance given. So the manual fees are actually for all services. 
Uh, bear in mind that- mm-hmm <affirmative>. uh, e- even the platforms, be the mobile money platform is supported by, you know, a group technical and stuff like that. So, that's the concept. 
Um, when we actually applied for the, for the, for the, um, finances, um, approval, uh, total revenues, 
which included the revenue service 
from what is now Mobile Money Limited. 
Okay. Will you just confirm, it does include, uh, 
mobile money? Sorry, was that a question? Sorry. I just wanted to confirm. Uh, you, you're saying that the management team include revenue from mobile money, from MoMo. 
Yes. As, as, as at the time when we were, we, we, we submitted the application, that was, that what was approved for. 
Okay. And, and those management fees had been charged, had been remitted up to the group? 
Yes. They've been charged and they've been… Those are the earlier figures we quoted, um, and they've been charged into the, into, into the, in the financial statement. Understood. Great. Thank you, guys. 
The next question is from Binta Drave from Blakeney. Please go ahead. 
Um, thank you, guys for the presentation and the time for the call. 
I just wanted to quickly, um, ask you in terms of, um, um, for the merchant payment and mer- merchant agent, agency network, 
what's the, what's the evolution year on year? 
And the s- the other, the second question is regarding the impact of the changes and regulation, the PSA, the new PSA Act. 
That's, uh, the impact of this on the Q4 mobile revenue. 
What should we expect for the, for the full year 2020? 
Do you 
think, uh, some of those changes would be, um, offered by increased usage or do you, do you see an impact coming through in 2020? 
Okay. Um, so let me answer the second question first and then we'll come back to the first question. 
So in terms of the, the changes for 2020, we'll expect to continue to see strong growth in MoMo Money on the revenue line. 
Um, the focus really on MoMo Money is to continue to drive merchant payment, 
um, which today is about 2% of the total revenue, but we should see that continue to grow, um, as we gain more merchants. 
In terms of the year on year, 
um, we ended last year with about 80,000, uh, merchants, and we finished… 
Sorry. We ended 2018 with about 80,000 merchants, and we finished 2019 at about 100, over 100,000 merchants. 
So we should see good growth this year as well in terms of merchant services. 
But more importantly, we should see an increase in the transaction per merchant, with the merchant that were newly onboarded last year. 
So we'd expect some good growth, some good growth from that. 
Thanks. The final question is from Ken Alo from SSNIT. Please go ahead. 
Hello. Thank you, uh, for the opportunity, and congratulations on your performance. Um, 
I see a lot of the banks not coming up with their MoMo business, 
and I want to find out if, um, from your projections, 
how far would these, uh, bank businesses affect your MoMo business? Thank you. 
Sure. Thanks for the question. Uh, uh, and 
I think it's too early to tell, but if I just sort of take, you know, um, um, an industry perspective where the MoMo Money industry is still, 
you know, very, very young. 
Um, the, the opportunities for transactional activity is, is massive. If you look at the, the inaudible that I gave, uh, uh, to an earlier question. 
I mean, customers are doing five P2Ps per user, per month currently and, and, and, uh, I- and about five partial per month, per user. 
I mean, that's a very low number, and we should expect that, you know, in… In its mature stage, you should expect 20 to 30 transactions per user, per month. 
On the basis of that, I think, you know, having new entrance in the marketplace, 
um, that can allow customers to get more used and comfortable to digital currency. We've continue to help the industry and the ecosystem continue to expand. 
So at this stage, it's very difficult to tell the direct impact on us as a business, 
but I do think that as an industry, we should expect the industry to continue to expand quite rapidly the more the players come in and help us develop the ecosystem. 
Jeremiah, we have no further questions. Okay. Um, thank you once again for making time for today's call.
