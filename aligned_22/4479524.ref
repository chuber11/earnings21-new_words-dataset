Thank you, Cynthia. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. 
In this quarter, we've pre- preserved against a challenging macro environment with COVID-19 flare-ups and a global chip supply shortage 
that constrained auto production. 
While our revenue contracted by 38.9% year-over-year to RMB61 .1 million, 
primarily due to cancellations, cancellations of a number of our offline auto shows in response to pandemic conditions, 
we forged ahead with our online initiatives, 
streamlined our cost base, and narrowed our net loss attribut- attributable to the company's shareholders by 10.7% year-over-year to RMB36 .8 
million. 

Before we discuss our third quarter results in more detail, 
let's first talk about our strategic plan to expand our business into EV manufacturing, 
catering to the rising consumer demand of electric vehicles, leveraging our existing platform. 
We're esta, we're establishing a new EV business line, including a design, R&D, and a man, and a manufacturing team. 
While holding open discussions with potential strategic partners, 
we will announce the progress of major business transactions, if any, in a timely man, in a timely manner. 
China is the largest EV market in the world, 
with sales reaching over 1.3 million in 2020, 
representing close to 44% of all EVs sold globally. 
In 2021, 
our EV retail sales penetration in China rose to 14.8% 
throughout the year and, uh, 22.6% in December, from 5.8% in the year 2020. 
According to the China Passenger Car Association, 
in 2022, 
EV sales in China are expected to reach 5.5 million, 
growing at a CAGR 
of 
106%, much faster than the overall passenger vehicle market, 
supported by the 
expe, 
uh, expedited, uh, establishment of EV infrastructure and technological advancements 
that have lowered vehicle costs, as well as improved interactive smart features, features. 
While government regulation and the industry standard on environmental protection and the emission continue to be favorable, 
many of the emerging EV OEM are building a direct sales network 
so that, so they can interact firsthand with their users to shape their purchase experience and efficiently receive feedback on our user needs and preference to con, to continuously enhance their products and services. 
In this context, we believe we are well-positioned to capit- capitalize on consumers' rising demand for EVs, given our tremendous customer base. 
Under the depth and the breadth of our customer insights, 
we have cumulatively 
served for, served over 30 million customers 
and facilitated more than 1.4, uh, 1.4 million automobile, automobile sales transactions, 
with GMV of approximately RMB200 billion via our integrator automotive marketplace. 
Furthermore, we have extensive sales operations 
covering 125 cities as of September 30th, 2021, 
to enable the success of our EV manufacturing. 
We will harness 
our leading auto sales capabilities and the sales network spanning from first-tier cities to 
provincial countries na- nationwide. 
Through seamless- seamlessly integrating our existing platform with the top-tier electric vehicle design, 
R&D, and the manufacturing team we are 
building, and, uh, in-depth cooperation with potential strategic partners, 
we are confident this strategic expansion will drive significant synergistic value and ensure we secure and, secure our important stake in the EV revolution. 
Now, let me provide third quarter highlights from our business segments. 
First, we further enhanced our solid leadership positions in offline marketing service 
by creating new retail consumption scenarios through innovative platforms and strategic cooperation with partners. 
Due to resurging COVID-19 cases and the industry-wide chip shortages, 
that affected the production schedule of many OEMs, 
many OEMs, the number of auto shows we organized were reduced to 65 across 55 cities, 
compared to 152 auto shows in 107 cities in the third quarter of 2020. 
These shows generated net revenues of RMB33 .1 million, 
representing, representing a 59.9% year-over-year decrease. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance our offline marketing services 
by leveraging our proprietary data ana- analytics 
capabilities and continuing to strengthen our collaboration with strategic partners 
and diversify, diversify our retail events and scenarios, scenarios 
with more creative marketing solutions. 
We will also conduct further in-depth studies to identify in granular detail 
areas 
with relatively high, higher potential ROI, and to fine-tune our offline pre- presence and a mix of offline and online marketing services accordingly. 
Next, let's move on to our growth initiatives in virtual dealership and online marketing services. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we extend, extended our online marketing services 
penetration by providing best-in-class user management, 
online training, and events management services to OEMs and the dealers. 
These improvements led to a 7, uh, 72 point, uh, 
72.6% year-over-year increase in net revenues from virtual dealership and online marketing services. 
Going forward, 
we will further build on our existing business as an integrated automotive marketplace, 
while leveraging our innov, uh, innovative, uh innovative foundation to expand into EV manufacturing.

we continue to open discussions 
with potential strategic partners and are on track to identify candidates 
with highly complementary strengths that will allow the creation of substant- substantial synergistic value. 
We're optimistic that, that as China's auto market undergoes 
structural changes toward, uh, smarter and more energy efficient mobility solutions,

coupled with the top-tier design, R&D, and the manufacturing teams we're building, 
as well, as well as the in-depth operation with potential strategic partners, 
will unlock significant value and lay a solid foundation for success. 
Now, I will turn the call over to Chenxi, our deputy CFO, for a closer look at our financial performance in the third quarter. 
Thank you, Mr. Wen. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, 
given the weakening auto markets and the impact from the pandemic, with net revenues of RMB61 .1 million.

We are excited, our, our decision to enter the EV manufacturing 
and are ready to chart a new path forward, while continuing to pursue innovation 
and positioning the company to capitalize on future consumer demand. 
Next, I'd like to walk through our third quarter 2021 financial results. 
Before I start, please note that all numbers stated in my following remarks are in RMB unless otherwise noted. 
Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB61 .1 million, decreasing by 38.9% from RMB100 million in the same period last year. 
This was a result of 59%, 59.3% year-over-year decrease in revenues generated from offline marketing services.

Revenues from special promotional events in the third quarter of 2021 were RMB1 .3 million, compared with RMB2 million in the third quarter of

million in the third quarter of 2020. 
Gross margin was 76.6% in the third quarter of 2021, compared with 72.1% in the same period last year,

In the third quarter, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 34.6% 
to 40, to RMB59 .9 million from RMB91 .6 million in the third quarter of 2020. 
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in promoter expenses and stock compensation expenses 
as a result of decreased volume of offline events. 
G&A expenses 
increased to RMB17 million from RMB15 .9 million in the third quarter of 2020 
and RMB14 .4 million in the second quarter of 2021. 
Research and development expenses were RMB9 .2 million compared with RMB7 .1 
million in the third quarter of 2020 and RMB8 .8 million in the second quarter of 2021, 
primarily due to higher stock compensation expenses for research and development personnel.

and higher compared with RMB9 .3 million in the second quarter of 2021.

Now, turning to our balance sheet. At the end of September 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of RMB134 .3 million. 
For further details regarding our 2021 third financial results, please refer to our earnings press release. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect our net revenues to be between approximately RMB70 million and RMB80 million, 
representing a year-over-year decrease of approximately 57.8% to 51.7%. 
This is primarily attributable to the estimated decline in the expected number of offline events to be held in the fourth quarter of 2021, 
including auto shows and pro, special promotion events 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of global microchip supply shortage on the auto industry.
