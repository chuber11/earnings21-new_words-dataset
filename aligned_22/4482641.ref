Thank you very much for joining the conference call for financial briefing for the third quarter of Y2021 of Advantus Corporation, despite your busy schedule. 
Today's participants are President and CEO, Mr. Yosheda, 
CFO Mr. Fujita, Chief Customer Relation Officer Mr. Sakamoto, and a Court Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Stakeholder Officer Mr. Mihashi. 
Today, Mr. Fujita will present the financial results for the third quarter of Y2021 first, followed by FY2021 outlook by Mr. Yosheda. 
And we will take your questions. We're scheduled to close our meeting 4:30 PM. 
The presentation material is available on PD net and in our website. 
Let me go through disclaimer statement in advance. 
This presentation contains forward-looking statements based on the current estimates, and they contain risks and uncertainties. 
Actual results may be different from the estimates, and we appreciate your acknowledgement in advance. 
Now, Mr. Fujita will read the presentation. 
Good afternoon, everyone. This is Fujita. I will present the financial results for the third quarter of Y2021. 
Please turn to page four of the presentation material, for the summary of the third quarter results. 
Let me review the business environment in the third quarter. 
As in the previous inaudible quarters, our business environment in the third quarter continued to be favorable. 
Aggressive testing was driven primarily by SOC Semiconductor Manufacturers 
inaudible that our factory boosting the level of testing demand, such as expanding data investment, higher 
5G smartphone functionality, and semiconductor performance needs, 
including further miniaturization. 
On the other hand, the shortage of semiconductors remains unresolved. 
And since semiconductor testers use a significant number of semiconductors, we continue to face production difficulties in the third quarter. 
However, we made a company-wide effort to secure the necessary parts, 
and we're about to achieve serious profits that exceeded our expectations three months ago. 
As a result, third quarter results include the record high quarterly sales, and upping the income since we began quarterly disclosure. 
Details will be explained in the following slides. Please turn to page five. 
Third quarter orders by segment. 
In the second quarter, due to our extended product lead times, customers made production plans for their inaudible, 
and we received many orders placed inaudible conventional timing. We suggested two hour lead times. 
Although our product's lead times have not come down in the third quarter, 
the advanced ordering trend that occurred in the second quarter has subsided considerably. 
We believe this is the reason for the significant quarter on quarter decreasing orders in the third quarter. 
Semiconductor and components test different systems. 
Orders were 102.5 billion, down 
39.5% quarter on quarter. 
Orders for associate testers were 85.7 billion, down by 62 billion quarter on quarter. 
However, as shown in the graph on the right, 
demand for associate testers is steadily increasing compared to last year and the year before last, mainly for high-energy devices. 
Orders achieved a level higher than our internal forecast three months ago, and we believe that customer's interest in other types is still strong. 
Memory tester orders were 15.8 billion, down by five billion quarter on quarter. 
Orders for DRAM testers have, which had been strong for some time through the second quarter, are taking a pause here, but this is in line with our expectations. 
Mechatronics systems orders were 11.4 billion, down by 35.3% quarter on quarter. 
Mechatronics orders decreasing steps with the four other tester orders. 
So this supporting others, orders were 22.4 billion, up 34.8% quarter on quarter. 
On top of continuing annual maintenance contract renewal, system test orders were strong. 
Slide six shows the third quarter sales by segment. 
Amidst continuing parts shortages, sales trended above our internal forecast. 
For semiconductor and component test systems, sales totaled 80.2 billion yen, 
up 33.7% quarter on quarter. 
Breaking that down, SOC tester sales were 63.1 billion yen, and memory tester sales were 17.1 billion yen. 
SOC tester sales were higher than expected, maybe for high and SOC devices used in smartphones and servers. 
Memory testers performed well overall in both the DRAM and non-volatile memory categories. 
However, sales undershot expectations, as some customers revised their investment plans. 
Mechatronics systems totaled 10.9 billion yen, up 14.9% quarter on quarter. 
Services support and others totaled 21 billion yen, about the same as in the previous quarter. 
Slide seven shows orders and sales by region. 
First, the orders. 
In Taiwan, South Korea, 
orders decreased in a reaction to the second quarter's surge triggered by longer lead times for our products, which has now subsided. 
China saw strong orders for testers for display driver Ics used in TVs and smartphones in the third quarter. 
As for sales by region, shown on the right, sales to South Korea declined slightly. But, overall sales were on our gross trajectory. 
Slide eight shows DNL-related figures. 
Gross margin was 57.9%. Our sales mix shifted toward more profitable products. 
SGNA including all other income and expenses totaled 31.3 billion yen. 
Support and other expenses increased fractionally, following gross and revenue. 
Operating income was 33.5 billion yen, with operating margin at 29.9%. 
Slide nine shows the third quarter R&D expenses and others. R&D expenses totaled 11.8 billion yen. 
R&D expenses to sales ratio was 10.5%. 
inaudible amounted to 4.8 billion yen. 
In the third quarter, we've continued to steadily invest in the expansion of our US manufacturing base, which began in the second quarter. 
Depreciation and accommodation totaled 3.9 billion yen. Cashflow is shown on the right. 
Free cashflow was net outflow of 16.6 billion yen. 
Due to our acquisition of R&D Altanova in November, 
cashflow from investing activities increased in the third quarter, and free cashflow became negative. 
Slide 10 shows the balance sheet as of December 31st. Total assets were 462.3 billion Yen. 
Cash and cash equivalence totaled 121.7 billion yen. 
Goodwill and intangible assets amounted to 80.7 billion yen, 
an increase of 26.6 billion quarter on quarter, accepting our acquisition of R&D Altanova. 
As final figures for purchase price allocation or PPA are not yet available. 
We have booked goodwill and intangible assets based on provisional estimates. 
Along liabilities, short-term borrowings totaled 28.7 billion yen. 
As we continue to make aggressive investments in the US, such as the acquisition of R&D Altanova, an extension of our production base there, 
we have raised the necessary funds through short-term borrowings. 
Equity accredited to owners of the parents was 281.5 billion yen. 
Equity ratio was 60.9%, down 4.9 points quarter on quarter. 
The progress of our shared repurchase is disclosed in our filings. 
By the end of December, 4.68 million shares of common stock has been acquired for 45.7 billion yen, 
accounting for 47% of our upper limits of 10 million shares, and 65% of our upper limit of 70 billion yen. 
That concludes my presentation on the third quarter results. 
This is Yosheda. I present the outlook for FY2021. 
Please turn to page 12, semiconductor tester market trends. 
Ongoing semiconductor performance gains and growing production volumes made 2021 a very active year for the semiconductor tester market. 
Although this is preliminary fear, the value of the semiconductor tester market in 2021 is thought to have about 5.4 billion US dollars, 
increasing about 30% a year. 
Various changeable factors may affect the 2022 tester market, such as of a late time constraint, and the visibility is poor. 
But we expect SOC tester market growth to range from about 10% to slightly over 20% in one year. 
Breaking this down, we expect that automotive industrial and consumer-related semiconductors will make further gains in 2022. 
At the same time, leading each product, we've continued to play the role of gross driver. 
For the past decade, smartform application processes 
have been in the forefront of semiconductor performance gains. 
But in 2022, we expect a high inaudible computing devices to take the lead. 
Memory tester market gross is expected to range from slightly below 10% to 15% in one year in 2022. 
The trend toward memory device performance gains, including greater density, faster speed, and higher bandwidth is from working the gross in the test market. 
We still cannot make any clear and quantitative predictions about 2023 and beyond. 
However, with event that current series shortage of semiconductors result. Structures demand for semiconductors will continue to grow. 
Further administration and further improvement in semiconductor integration 
through the adaptation of advanced packages regenerate demand for more sophisticated and more highly-integrated test solutions. 
We believe that the tester market will continue to grow over the median to long-term, despite 
minor adjustments. Please turn to page 13. You'll find 2021 forecast. 
Based on the uh, results through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have revised our fore-year quote just upward. 
Orders are now expected 
to increase by 85 billion yen to 650 billion yen. Serious and inaudible income are expected to increase by 10 billion yen, to 410 billion yen and 115 billion yen respectively. 
And the net income is expected to increase by 7.5 billion yen to 86.3 billion yen. Is by 7.5 billion yen, to 86.3 billion yen. 
Our current priority, is part of procurement, and we cannot yet to be optimistic here. 
Sudden delays in the delivery of parts, may occur. 
And we cannot assume this presents no risk to our achievement of our post quarter assessment. 
That said, we are working to secure the necessary parts, and expect to set new series and profit records for the second consecutive year. 
Gross profit margin is expected to be around 
57% for the full year, as our product mix in the second half, is better than it was three months ago. 
<unk> expenses in the post quarter, are expected to be flat or slightly down from the third quarter. 
The 
forecast, is based on the exchange rate assumptions of one US dollar to one to 115 Japanese yen, and one euro to one to 130 Japanese yen, 
for the fourth quarter FY- 2021. 
Our latest forecast for the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on FY-21, overthinking is plus one billion yen, pound per yen of Japanese yen depreciation versus US dollar, 
in the minus 150 million yen, uh, 
yen Japanese in depreciation, versus the Euro. 
As announced in November 2021. We acquired r&d turnover in the South due to financial consolidation for the middle of the third quarter. 
However, the impact on our business results, for the current fiscal year is expected to be minor. 
Slide 14. 
F-Y 21 Outlook by segment. 
For semiconductor and component test systems out look: 
Our full year's sales forecast for SOC testers is 218 billion yen, up 16 billion yen from our October forecast. 
The increasing complexity of testing APU application processors HPC high performance 
computers, and other devices, due to the 
neutralization; continues to drive strong demand for testers. 
Customer motivation to invest in automotive, industrial and display test, has remained high, 
and strong orders for SOC testers continue. 
Our full year sales forecasting for memory testers, is 62 billion yen, down 10 billion yen from our October forecast. 
As you can see from our orders, to learn for DDR five, the next generation D- RAM and non volatile memory, is solid as a whole. 
But we lowered our sales forecast, in light of certain customers revising their investment plans, in the second half of the year. 
Slide 15: Our full year sales forecast for mechatronics system is 45.5 billion yen, 
slightly lower than the October forecasts. 
We have raised our full year sales forecasts for the services, and other segments, by 6.6 billion to 84.6 billion yen. 
Currently, our system level test business mainly targets high end 
<unk> as seen in our SOC tester outlook. Testament in that area is growing more than expected, raising our expectation for the full year. 
Also, in the system level test business we plan to strategically increase recurring revenue as a percentage of sales 
through aggressive M and A and flexible capital investment. 
We will continue to steadily implement business expansion measures, and promote the diversification of our earnings space. 
Slide 16 is the summary. 
2021, a very strong year for the tester market is over. 
But our business discussions with semiconductor manufacturers, indicates that there is currently no sign of demand declining anywhere. 
The direction of the semiconductor market, and the final product markets, prefigures continued after the investments in test capacity, to improve the performance and reliability of semiconductors, in 2022. 
In order to keep up with our customers appetite for investment, we will continue to make stabilizing parts to procurement a priority. 
In view of future sustainable expansion of our business opportunities, we will steadily promote measures for medium to long term business growth and greater resilience. 
Our sales have almost doubled in the four years since 2017. 
We see the need to steadily strengthen our internal control system, in line with the expanding scale of our business. 
We will improve operational excellence, by responding to shifts, such as changes in work cells and large cells, triggered by COVID-19. 

ESG related changes in the capital markets and society etc. 
Demand is strong, but we are aware of the risk of new issues emerging, just when everything seems to be going well. 
We will look at an early achievement of our midterm management plan targets, while being fully alert to such risks, as 
worsening of parts procurement, due to supply chain bottlenecks and logistical difficulties. 
Decline in demand due to slowdowns in the global economic recovery, 
potential impacts from US/China conflict, and economic security policies on the semiconductor industry, 
as well as geopolitical risks, such as the recent Ukraine Russia tensions. 
Thank you for your attention. We'll proceed to Q and A session. 
The question is from Mr. Okazaki of NOMURA Securities. 
Thank you for the striking financial results today. 
One question per person, So firstly, I'd like to ask about your order forecast that you revised upward this time. 
Let us know it's content, in which you have been concerned for the slowdown that was presented by Teradyne. 
This is a Model. 
As for the orders in the third quarter, which showed upside, I like to make some comments. 
Whatever up by 36 billion yen. And, as for the breakdown, associate tester was up 27 billion yen. 
As mentioned before, it says customers demand for high end device, including APU in HPC has been increasing. 
The demand for D-D-I-C, is also picking up. 
And the next, uh, the S-O-C order, 
in the third quarter, is 70% by computer communication, 15% by automotive industrial and consumer related, and 15% by DDI. 
Memory between Nine News expectation. Mechatronics was up three billion yen, boosted by device interface, 
and service was up by six billion yen, half of the increase with by authority. 
As for the three year forecast. 
It was revised up, by 85 billion yen with 70 billion yen upside uh, SOC tester, and 15 billion yen of Saudis and others. 
Not only for the leading institutes, but overall associated to is expected to grow. 
Service and others growth will be driven mainly, by the growth of <unk>. inaudible speaking, 
you may have the impression of slowing down due to the peers announcement. 
But the difference between us and the peer, is that we have extensive customer base for high performance 
computing, and due to the strong growth, 
that is demonstrated by the grossing orders. 
Test time is getting longer, for the leading edge process. And this strength is a source of the differentiation. 
Thank you very much, as a follow up question: is the issue there now commented on HPC then it will be the future pillar of the business. 
When you say HPC, do you mean GPU? or Upcore, and if it is GPU, to give us the background of the longer test time for GPU. 
Thank you Mr. Wakiya This is Mi Hershey. We categorized as HPC, high performance computing, 
and that improved graphics processor unit, as you mentioned, 
and diverse accelerators for processing, and high end FPGA. 
High end petitions for data center are included here. 
So this is not only for GPU. 
We're Understood, Thank you. Thank you very much. 
Thank you for the question. 
The next question is from Mr. Yoshida of CRSA Securities. 
This is the issue that of CRSA Security Do you hear me? 
Yes, you presented the market estimate for this year, 4.5 to 
5.0 billion for SOC, and 1.4 to 1.5 billion US dollars for memory. And you talked about the difference between you and the competitors. 
How do you see the share dynamic? 
Presumably, as you mentioned, your HPC customers will adapt or five nano G, and I assume that will lead to your share again. 
Would you comment on the share dynamics SOC and memory, from the previous year to this year. 
Wakiya This is Mi Hershey 
I took that, your question is about the comparison between the current year 2021, And the calender year, 2022. Is that right? Yes. 
Sheer dynamics who've really affected by customers business trend, 
and for the next year, according to our market forecast. 
Thought it is slightly hard to tell, competitors, customers business trend, will slow down. 
And naturally, it really leads to our share gain. 
So next year, our share in computer communication, will grow. 
And besides the share gain, in high end 
product, we expect to have potential market growth of automotive, industrial, and consumer raters, next year as well. 
We concluded the share gain, in those markets, in our forecast for the year. 
<unk> memory, I said before that HPC will push up that SOC business. 
And with the growth of a high end performance computing. 
Of memory side, 
<unk> DDS R-S, for graphic, or <unk>. inaudiblerun 
application really growing the next year, 
and based on these, we put up the market estimate. 
In this area we expect that our customers remove activity next year. 
And that result in our share gain. 
Thank you, so you expect to gain share, boosting SOC and memory in 2022, Do you? 
Sakamoto speaking: Yoshiba mentioned before, you expect in 2022, HPC will gain strong momentum. 
We do have high share inaudible and through customer engagement, we will gain share and Boost sales. 
Data Center demand will grow, and the full fledged mass production will be launched for D- RAM and DDR-5. DRAM and the DDR5. 
As we have strong share in DRAM, we regain share in this area as well. 
And we achieve strong share gain in SOC and memory. 
Thank you. As a follow-up question, you commented on the direction in 2022, 
but further down the road toward 2023, you gave us some colors before that the growth will be sustained, 
but toward 2023 with the rollout of 3-nano G, competitors' customers will increase investment. 
How shall we see your business toward 2023? 
For 3-nano G, you may have new customers who are not, uh, customers of competitors, 
but can you capture new business at the launch of 3-nano G? How should we see your prospect toward 2023? 
Ishida speaking. Given the 30% growth in 2021, 
20% in 2022, you may wonder the sustainability of the growth in 2023. 
I am not optimistic, either. 
Currently, with a longer lead time, order level has been high, 
and then the lead time is shortened, the growth in orders will be slowing down. 
But we have a high expectation for the node development from 5-nano to 3-nano. 
With a progress, the testing is technically getting more difficult and customers are also wondering how to test products. 
This is the area where we can leverage our strengths with the strong appetite for technology buy. 
We may observe overall slowdown, but in our prospect, demand for test for new technology 
will be sustained in 2023, ' 24 and ' 25. I see. Thank you. 
Thank you for your question. Next question is from Mr. Danielson of Macquarie Capital Securities. 
This is Danielson of Macquarity Capital, Macquarie Capital. 
Do you hear me? Your guidance for the first quarter, OP margin is considerably high. 
It might be the record high, 30.9%, 
and your order backlog is high, and the ratio of SOC tester is also high. 
As for the OP margin for the next year will be sustained, or will it increase further? 
Would you conceive any upside potential and, uh, downside risk? 
The forecast on page 13 shows the operating margin for the first quarter as 30.9%. 
This is supported by the favorable product mix. 
And given the order backlog of SOC, 
I expect the similar level of OP margin is achievable in the process we are working on the order backlog. 
But we also expect the cost increase in parts, logistics and labor, 
so the after situation is highly uncertain. 
We have not secured all the parts for 2022 yet. 
So given those concerns, if we can achieve the guidance for the first quarter, 
you can take the next year will be close to this level. 
Thank you. Supply tightness of the semiconductor will continue everywhere, 
but in the visibility, how 
much of your need for the next year is already secured? 
With a gross of 20% for SOC tester, how much can you cover in your supply chain? 
Are you asking about our supply chain, not about the entire semiconductor? 
Your supply chain of semiconductor and non-semiconductor. 
How far order backlog can you manage? Six months, or nine months? How much remaining risk do you have now? 
Even for the sales in the fourth quarter, I said in the presentation that I cannot say no risk. 
In the very tight condition, we are negotiating with our suppliers, 
and unfortunately at this moment, we cannot comment about what will happen in what timing through the year. 
This is not our unique issue, but automotive and many other companies share the same issue. 
But for some product, due to the economic slowdown in China, 
inventory buildup will hold and the excess generated there might relieve pressure on other semiconductors, 
and this might mitigate the supply-demand tightness. 
I hope you understand that, uh, we cannot specify 
the timing and how it will be resolved clearly at this moment. Understood. Thank you. 
However, our customers are also serving as suppliers, 
so despite the strong customers' request for testers, actually, we cannot produce, uh, due to the lack of semiconductor. 
Such situation has been ongoing, so through various channels, 
now we are trying to build momentum to prioritize SPE in supply as a semiconductor. 
Thank you for your detailed explanation. Thank you for the question. 
Next question is from Mr. Hirakawa of BofA Securities. Thank you. I'm Hirakawa of BofA. 
I also would like to ask about the PAS procurement. 
I'd like to hear about the current PAS procurement environment compared to three months ago. Has it changed or remain unchanged or getting worse? 
Has the parts insured changed? Let us know the change from three months ago. 
The issues visible three months ago remain unsolved. 
In any case, the parts insured are very limited, and that they have not expanded. 
And since they are semiconductor parts, for the sudden production increased demand, 
it must have extra capacity that will be duly responded, but actually there is no such extra capacity, and that's ongoing. 
So if there is a demand for production increase, priority in the parts needs to be adjusted. As a result, 
whether an improvement is observed from three months ago, we do not feel so. 
But we do not see the aggravation, either. 
Orders have been increasing further and we need to place additional orders for suppliers. 
But suppliers cannot respond immediately. 
I see. Thank you. Uh, follow-up question. I'm always impressed with Mr. Yoshida's cautious remarks. 
Now, you are expecting the SOC tester market to grow by 10 
to 20%, and you're expecting over 20% growth in your revenue. 
True, you did say you haven't fully secured all of the necessary parts for that, 
but I got the impression that you actually have a pretty good prospect for satisfying the procurement requirement. Can you elaborate on that? 
We are providing our suppliers with a longer-term forecast together, uh, with the purchase orders being placed early on. 
So true, we believe that the volume of secured parts should increase from what it is today. 
But the question is, can we really secure all the amount for sure with absolute certainty? 
Well, many things could happen with semiconductor suppliers, including some unexpected defects. 
So, in that sense, we do not have a full visibility. There are some wafers that have yet to be loaded, so there are risks in that sense. 
But keep in mind that we will start from the order backlog of 350 billion yen, 
and at the current rate, that 350 billion yen worth should be shipped in less than a year. 
And, we do have actions in place to procure the necessary part. 
The point is, we are taking actions, but whether they would ensure the full amount is not 100% sure. I see. Thank you. 
Next is Mr. Nakamura from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. 
You said system-level test demand at the present moment is very strong. Can you elaborate on the background? 
I understand that it is in conjunction with strong demand for SOC testers, 
but is it due to an increase in the number of customers or is it due to increase in applications? 
This is Mihashi speaking. 
The background for strong SLT demand is as you indicated. 
The system market is self-growing, 
basically, starting from APU and other mobility applications to high-end and/or automotive applications. 
In addition, 
we are focusing on recurring consumables business related to SLT hardware and system sale. 
The combination of the two are driving the current strong order levels. 
I see. So in that sense, it's not the increase in customers, but increase in applications. Am I correct? 
Yes, but increased applications also entail increased customers. 
I see. Uh, follow-up question on profitability. 
Current profitability or the operating, uh, the profit margin of a system-level test is what I have a question on. 
How does it compare to your overall company-wide profit margin? 
Profit margin of system-level tests is not very different from that of ATE profitability overall. 
So, pretty high. 
The new acquisition has yet to be included, 
but the profit margin of the two previous acquisitions as well as the business for SSD 
is not very different from that of SOC tester or ATE overall. 
I see. So that means a margin of over 30%, correct? Do you mean growth margin? 
No, operating margin. 
Actually, none of our businesses have reached over 30% operating margin yet. It's a little less than that. 
Our internal projection of, uh, 30%, uh, is overall for the fourth quarter. 
So, it could be close to 30%. Maybe ATE is a bit higher. 
I see. That's helpful. Thank you. That's all. 
Next is Mr. Hasegawa from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. 
Thank you. I would like to ask further on memory testers. 
I know it's a delicate subject, but you mentioned some customers revising their investment plans. 
Can you elaborate on that to the extent possible? Also, what about other factors? 
This is Sakamoto speaking. This is Sakamoto speaking. Uh, yes, some customers revise their investment plans. 
But I will refrain from giving specifics. 
One thing I can say for sure is that while we revise the guidance downward ¥10 billion it 
is not due to order cancellations or competitors taking our market share or slowing down of the market. 
So we got, we regard this as the postponement, which shall contribute to the FY22 sales. 
I see. So what about other customers or applications such as DRAM and NAND? 
Market is very strong 
as for DRAM, as mentioned earlier, customers are investing to prepare for the mass production of DDR5 
the same for LPDDR5. 
As for NAND manufacturers are adding more layers. Uh, they have plans for that and are executing that. 
Both DRAM and NAND related investments are very active. So we will make sure we capture that momentum. I see. 
So investment plan changes are limited only to specific customers, 
and as far as other customers and applications are concerned, strong investment momentum continues. Am I correct? Yes. 
You talked about gaining more market share next year. So is it fair to say that that should be carried over to FY22? Yes. 
Thank you. That's all. 
Next is Mr. Yoshikawa from Morgan Stanley, MUFG Securities. 
Thank you. I think my question has been generally answered by your previous comments. But just for clarification, 
your projection for 2022 SOC tester market is between $4.5 billion to $5 billion with 
growth rates of 10% to over 20% 
that's a pretty wide range. 
I take it that given a large order backlog, 
this wide range is not due to demand, but that it depends on the parts procurement level. Am I correct? 
Yes. We believe that will be a big factor. 
Plus the investment level of semiconductor manufacturers, where our exposure is small, 
which is not yet clear. 
So it's a combination of those two factors. 
I see. So let's use this midpoint of over 15% growth. 
Based on what you said your market share is expected to increase in 22. 
So it could be higher, closer to 20% or even higher on a calendar year basis. Am I correct? 
For SOC overall, yes that is our expectation. 
I see. A follow up 
question, regarding SOC you said you have great expectation for HPC, 
maybe it's a awkward question, but, uh, looking at HPC communication and other automotive applications, 
how would you rank them in terms of growth rate? 
This is Mihashi speaking. You mentioned HPC 
Communication applications, meaning mobile And automotive and industrial equipment. 
Automotive and industrial equipment are small in terms of PAM but 
they have highest growth rate 
followed by HPC. 
Mobile market is still large, but in terms of growth, I think it's fair to say it's close to flat growth. I see. Thank you. 
What about display driver? 
For display driver 
flat to slight increase is what we project for calendar year 22. I see. 
Thank you. That's all. 
Next is Mr. Maikawa from Credit Suisse. 
Thank you. I have a question on your market share. 
Earlier you mentioned as a factor, major semiconductor manufacturer where your current share is low. 
I'm wondering if you'll be able to comment on that factor starting 2023. 
I say that because right now that company is only doing APU, but most probably from next year it will start using its own modems. 
And I believe you have a 100% market share in the conventional modem suppliers. 
So I'm wondering if we can expect you to win that business next year? 
Also, I don't know if we can call them the new customers, but I'm interested in hyper 
failures, which are increasingly using their own chips. 
Could they be added to your customer base? What's your expectation for this year and the next? 
In terms of expectation? Yes, we have a great expectation for hyperscalers. 
But what will be the volume is still not clear. 
And regarding the start of in-house production at the company where our current exposure is low, 
of course we are making marketing efforts aggressively. 
And similarly our competitor, our peer is approaching our customers aggressively. 
Our current exposure is limited, but we are making efforts to increase that. 
So what are expectations for 23 and 24? 
Since we are competing head to head, frankly, we wouldn't know until we actually see the results. 
In terms of the market share, even for SOC testers, it's currently 50 
/ 50 evenly split between the peer and us 
and I believe that would continue for some time. I see. Thank you. Thank you for your detailed response that's all. 
Next is Mr. Hanayo from SMBC Nikko Securities. 
Thank you. I have one question regarding your production capacity. 
For parts procurement you have already explained in detail so I understand. 
Now, given the market outlook and projected increase in your market share for next fiscal year, 
if we assume that your revenue goes up by 20% from this fiscal years ¥410 billion on 
a quarterly basis, the sales would be over ¥120 billion. 
My estimate is that 
perhaps ¥120 billion level is the upper limit of your current capacity, is the upper limit of what your current capacity can handle. 
So I'm wondering if you see the need for additional capital expenditure going forward, 
or would you stick to your conventional policy of not increasing fifth cost and resort to external resources. 
Can you comment on that? 
In terms of the production capacity expansion? 
Our basic policy is to handle incremental demand for systems through external resources, outsourcing. 
So we can respond to ¥120 billion sales with the current capacity, with the current system as long as we can secure parts supply. 
We don't have any plans to drastically change our business model and switch to increasing in-house production capacity. 
If there are incremental demands we will respond by enhancing external production capacity. We will respond through outsourcing. 
Having said that for some of the consumables, 
it is more efficient to produce in-house closer to customers. So for such some consumables 
there is the possibility of a capacity expansion, 
But for the sales level of ¥120 billion per quarter or ¥480 or ¥500 billion per year, 
I believe we can handle that with our current capacity. 
And conversely, even if they were to shrink to ¥400 billion or ¥350 billion for example, 
we would not be affected because of this production style. 
I see. Very clear. Thank you. That's all. 
Thank you for your questions. With this we end the Q&A session. Thank you for your participation.
