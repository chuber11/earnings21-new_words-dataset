Good morning, and thank you, Mike. And thank you all for joining us today. 
By nearly every measure, the third quarter of 2021 was an absolutely remarkable quarter for years. 
Global revenues for the quarter increased by 94% over the 2020 third quarter to $22.1 million. 
Gross profit increased by 93% to $9.5 million, 
and net income increased by a staggering 166% to $4.3 million. 
Third quarter growth was led by an exceptionally strong increase in international revenues, which grew substantially to $17.8 million 
from $7.1 million for the 2020 third quarter, 
as we successfully shift our highly anticipated 2022 line of products to our customers around the world. 
Our global supply chain team and manufacturing partners have done incredibly well in a challenging and often dynamic environment 
to ensure that inventory is delivered. 
And we believe that we are well positioned at this time to meet customer demand levels for the upcoming holiday shopping season. 
We have now achieved record breaking quarterly revenue for five consecutive quarters. In year over year revenue growth for the last 14 quarters, 
we are successfully growing yet into a leading global consumer brand that is respected around the world for designing and engineering exceptional products for the sports industry. 
Third quarter growth was impressive across our growing head to tail portfolio of products, 
with a $6.6 million increase in body on the sales, a $1.5 million increase in net price sales, a 
$1.5 million increase in the sale of other products plus and accessories, and a $1.1 million increase in home made sales. 
Let's take a look in more detail. 
Our body armor products are comprised of our range of chest protectors, body protectors, and vests, 
back protectors, knee braces, knee, and over guards, off-road motorcycle boots, and mountain biking shoes. 
The 114% increase in body armor revenue is attributable to a 101% increase in the volume of upper body protection sold during the period. 
This demand has resulted in significant restocking orders, 
with encouraging sales of our growing footwear category of motorcycle boots and mountain biking shoes contributing to exceed our expectations. 
Body armor accounted for 56% of 2021 third quarter revenue. 
We are very pleased with the performance of our neck brace products for the quarter, as they continue to generate a higher gross margin than our other product categories. 
More and more demand for our neck braces continues to increase, and neck brace sales accounted for 12% of 2021 third quarter revenue. 
Our other products, inaudible and accessories category are comprised of our bottles and hydration bags, our parallel line of jackets, pants, shorts, and jerseys, 
as well as our after, aftermarket support items. 
The 47% increase is due to 189% increase 
in the volume of mountain biking and off-road, and off-road motor apparel soldier in the period, as the global consumer demand for our cutting edge gears continues to surge. 
The other products' cost and accessories category accounted for 21% of third quarter revenue. 
The 93% increase in helmet sales during the third quarter 
is primarily due to 149% increase in the volume of our innovative award winning MTB and off-road motorcycle helmet lines 
sold globally during the 2021 period. 
Helmets accounted for 11% of our 2021 third quarter revenue, and remain a key focus area for our company. 
While international revenues for the quarter grew substantially, revenues in the United States grew at a more marginal rate. 
This was due in part to temporary domestic port congestions 
and trucking delays cause, causing a lag in the performance of domestic orders of our 2022 product line. 
Data and consumer demand for our products remains very strong in the US, 
and we have been able to deliver significant orders during the first half of the fourth quarter in time for the holiday shopping season. 
Our new warehouse in Reno, Nevada has three times the storage space of our California facility, 
which will enable us to fulfill a higher volume of orders, a key component of our continued development in the US. 
Reflecting back from the headline financials, total revenues for the third quarter of 2021 increased to $22.1 million, up 94%, 
compared to $11.4 million for third quarter of 2020. 
Gross profit for the third quarter increased to $9.5 million, up 93%, compared to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2020. 
Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 increased to $3.8 million, up 54%, compared to $2.9 million 
for the third quarter of 2020, due to increases in salaries, G&A costs, and professional fees. 
And income from operations for the third quarter of 2020 increase to $5.8 million, up 170%, 
compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2020, 
with net income for the third quarter 
coming in at $4.3 million or 79 cents per basic and 69 cents per diluted share, 
up 166%, compared to $1.6 million or 50 cents per basic and 27 cents per diluted share for the third quarter 2020. 
The extraordinary third quarter added to what is a really our strongest year ever. 
Global revenues for the first nine months of 2021 increased 91% to $49.3 million. 
Net income year today increased by 251% to $8.8 million, 
a return on revenue of 18%, and earnings of $1.61 per basic share. 
Turning to the balance sheet, at September 30, 2021, we have cash and cash equivalence of $2.59 million. 
Our current ratio stands at two to one, and we have no long term debt. 
We believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances along with net cash generated by operations are sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
We have no plans for any major capital intensive expenditures in the next 12 months 
beyond investment in molds and tooling to facilitate further expansion and refinement of our product categories. 
We believe that our performance for the third quarter demonstrates, once again, our ability to grow revenue, remain operationally efficient, and generate significant shareholder value. 
To summarize, global consumer spending, particularly on outdoor products like ours continues to grow as people participate in outdoor activities 
that provide some escape from the restrictions of the COVID pandemic. 
This is a trend that we expect to continue. 
Global demand for our exceptional head to toe protective gear for off-road motorcycle and MTB riders continues to surge around the world. 
We see this through significant restocking orders that we are managing with our supply chain and distribution partners worldwide. 
This sustained consumer demand along with recognition from the media, our business partners, and industry athletes continues to energize our entire team. 
While we still have a lot of work to do in order to differentiate our products, leverage our brand, and manage our supply chain, we remain committed to excellence in all that we do. 
Our team is focused on increasing our market share 
and refining our already strong pipeline of innovative products that we believe will continue to attract athletes and consumers around the world. 
In conclusion, we continue to evolve the company and the brand through our consistent focus on developing a diverse line of products, 
our growing sales and marketing efforts, and the nimble resilience of our global supply chain team during these dynamic times. 
We believe that we are well positioned to deliver an incredible financial performance in 2021 and beyond. 
As always, we'd like to thank our entire Leatt family, our dedicated employees, 
business partners, and team riders for their continued efforts and relentless support. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over for questions. Operator. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. 
If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. 
A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. 
For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we follow up questions. 
Our first question comes from Chris Jarrous with Dunlap Equity. Please proceed with your question. 
Hey, Sean. Congratulations on the exceptional- Hey, Chris. And 
thank you, 
Chris. I just wanna ask you, yeah, two, two questions. First one is, uh, you mentioned in your press release about being able to manage through supply chain issues. Obviously some products hub up in the 
course, but what, what are you guys doing? I mean, as a relatively small company in a 
large market, how have you been able to manage the, the supply chain, and given that you manufacture in China, 
what, what have you guys done that's allowed you to, to execute so well? 
So I think we've, 
uh, there, there's really two big drives that we've, um, that we focused on. The first is just, um, nurturing the relationships that we've had with some of our manufacturers, um, that we've been with for a very long time now. 
Um, and also with the tremendous growth that we've seen really become a very important, um, source of business for these, for these manufacturers, 
um, which has placed us in a favor position in terms of, um, manufacturing space. So that's the one side of it. 
And then in terms of just, um, the actual deliveries, um, uh, getting stopped onto the water, um, 
I think Leatt, um, has always been very well positioned, um, for the kind of situation that we now see with COVID. 
Um, we've got a solid, uh, supply chain set up actually in Asia. Um, and with the limited, uh, travel everyone can do now, um, into Asia, that has really benefited us. 
Uh, so we drive a lot of our, um, a lot of our supply chain globally, um, directly inside Asia, we have people there that are focused on 
getting our inventory from the manufacturer to all of our customers around the world. 
And I think that has, uh, really has been a great, uh, strength for us, uh, in these difficult times. 
Okay. So these aren't just regular brokers that anybody is using and, and are, you know, these are people- No. specific to, to Leatt? 
These people are focusing on Leatt 25 hours a day. Okay. That's great. 
Second question, kind of high, higher level question. 
Um, recent interviews with manufacturers of the e-bikes 
have said that, you know, they've got, their products are sold out for the next, you know, they've got two years of, of capacity sold through the channel already, they're just waiting to fulfill over time. 
And so that market is grown dramatically. And as I think about that market, I think about the different types of people that would use that, it allow, you know, that allows to enter the market, you know, kids, older people, people that 
historically aren't your, you know, 25 year old, uh, biker bombing down the mountain. 
Uh, so yeah, if that's, if that's, if that is correct in expanding to that market, 
I would think that those people are more interested in your types of products, innovative safety first kinds of products. 
What have you seen, and is that correct? And what have, what are e-bikes doing to the general MTB market? 
No, absolutely. I mean, there's obviously the different segments in the e-mountain biking, um, 
marketplace, um, and, uh, sorry, in the e-bike marketplace. And e-mountain biking is a very, very strong segment. 
Um, and, and that has definitely benefited us in terms of, uh, consumer demand, 
uh, because we do sell products that are, uh, protected. We've got a lot of new entrants, um, that are only able really to enter, um, this 
market, um, you know, because of the fact that these are electrified, um, bicycles. So they, they get to, to really experience some things that they never would've experienced, um, 
if it was not, uh, an e-bike, if it was a general bicycle. 
Um, and you know, that has really benefited us because these are the kinds of people, um, you know, either, uh, the gears being bought by parents for youngsters that are getting on, uh, onto these bikes, 
um, or, um, you know, the less capable, um, maybe slightly older people that have, um, no-guide access, um, to, to cycling as a sport, and can get to, to some great places, and potentially some really dangerous places actually. 
Um, you know, they are obviously very concerned about, um, getting back to work on Monday. 
Um, so for those people, um, the Leatt line 
of protection, and particularly the body armor and the surge, if you've seen body armor and demand of an e-bike, uh, the e-bike, e-mountain biking market has, um, has been one of the drivers, um, you know, around that, uh, surge in demand, um, uh, that we see. 
Um, and, you know, we do have products, some products that we have now started labeling as, uh, a very specific, uh, to e-mountain biking, 
but the vast majority of our body armor is absolutely perfect for a e-mountain bike rider, 
uh, which is great news, because we actually have the products, um, ready on site, um, you know, to serve these people. Um, so that has certainly, um, benefited us. 
Okay. Fantastic. So thank you, and best of luck in the Q4 season. 
Thanks very much, Chris. Chat soon. 
Our next question is from Christopher Mueller with a private investor. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Hi, Sean. Uh, congrats to you and the team on, uh, the continued success. 
Thanks very much, Chris, I'm happy to hear from you. 
I have, uh, maybe three questions for you today. 
Um, first of all, just, uh, just follow up on the supply chain. Um, besides the container delays to the US, are you seeing any challenges there, whether it be factory shutdowns or material shortages or such, 
um, that would impact your product availability or growth plan over the next few quarters? 
Uh, we haven't seen anything, uh, uh, major in terms of 
raw material shortages. Uh, some of the factories that we work with, 
um, have had temporary, um, uh, electrical, um, shutdowns, uh, but those are short 
term. Um, so most of the, uh, the, the kind of slowdown in manufacturing has been very short term in nature, and I don't see it affecting, um, 
our, um, ability to supply over the next, uh, several quarters. 
That's, that's great to hear. 
And, uh, last we spoke, you were just about to, um, begin shipping out of Reno. Um, you know, how, how is that progressing? Is that, is that all scaled up now, uh, in Q4? 
So it's great news. Uh, we are, um, we are shipping only out of Reno now, not shipping anything out of San Francisco anymore. 
Uh, Reno is now fully operational. We've, um, been able to get some, some really good warehouse, specific specialized warehouse staff, uh, in Reno. 
Um, and we are, we really are seeing, um, uh, and experiencing, um, uh, a great, 
um, increase in our ability to fulfill orders, uh, 
quickly, uh, at the Reno warehouse. Uh, as I say, it's fully operational and, and going really, um, guns blazing out of there. 
So that's great news. Yeah. Great, great news indeed. 
Um, any, uh, any significant changes in, in distributors or eCommerce retailers this year? 
Um, are you still finding expanded reach, particularly in the more, um, 
mainstream, uh, trail riding market on the mountain bike side? Absolutely. 
I think that's been something which has also been a key driver of our growth, 
um, over the last several quarters, is just our relationships, uh, that we built with, um, some of our e-commerce, um, uh, dealers that we now are dealing with directly. 
Um, you know, we really have been able to, to reach a much wider, uh, wider audience. Uh, you not only limited by, you know, where the distributor has a strength, 
um, we actually are a lot closer to, um, the end consumer. 
Um, and I think that's, that's part of the reason why we've seen some, some great demand for our, for our products. Just getting that, once you're closer to, um, uh, the end 
consumer, but still selling obviously through our dealer partners. 
And, uh, I noticed the, uh, the motor and the bike neck braces were consolidated into a single line this year. 
Um, besides the obvious benefits, uh, maybe a reduced inventory and a greater selection of colors for both markets, were there any other, either considerations or factors around that change? 
Sorry, could you, could you repeat that? I didn't fully understand that. 
So could you just repeat that? Uh, the, the, yes, the, the motor and the, uh, bike next brace lines look like they were 
consolidated into a single, single line this year. You no longer have, uh, designations on the, on the two different products. And I was just wondering what factors went into, into that change, 
and what, what are your expectations from that? Yes. Yes. Um, so 
I mean, I think that, you know, there's a couple of things that obviously, uh, came into that. Um, 
I mean, I think the biggest reason, um, is just that, um, there's very little differentiation actually between those two product lines, and we, 
you know, we wanted to be, um, authentic in terms of our product offering. So that's the one, the one angle. 
Um, and then the other side of it is just in terms of the manufacturing efficiency perspective, we didn't feel that having separate lines, um, was gonna change anything in terms of consumer demand. It certainly hasn't. 
Um, and also, um, it obviously makes things a lot more effective from a manufacturing perspective. 
Um, so with demand increasing, you know, we took the opportunity to, uh, to consolidate things just a little bit. Um, and I think that's gonna work out quite well for us. Thank you. All right. Well, that's all the questions 
I had for you. Um, uh, we just wanted give a shout out to your design team on a, uh, very impressive, uh, 2022 line. 
So, uh, thanks again, Sean. I'm sure we'll 
talk soon. Thanks, Chris. Chat soon. Cheers. 
Our next, our next question comes from Olivia Colombo, a private investor. Hello. Do you hear me? 
Hi, Olivia. Uh- Yes, I can hear you. 
Hello, Olivia. That's, that's perfect. Thank you, Sean. Congratulations on this incredible Q3 report. 
What is also remarkable is this, uh, quarter alone is 10% higher than your full sales in 2017. 
So I think this is, uh, quite an achievement. Uh, 
I have three questions- inaudible, thanks, Olivia. My pleasure, you know I like statistics 
<laugh>. Uh, my first question is, like most of the, uh, outdoors brands that have reported so far, 
uh, most of them have, uh, mentioned a slippage of some of their Q3 products into the next quarter. Uh, 
I guess, this is the same for you. Uh, is it possible for you to potentially quantify it eventually percentage-wise? 
Is it 10%, 15, 20%- Um-… do you think? 
I think what I would say is that we probably lost, uh, a good 20% of sales, uh, in the US, uh, because of the lag. 
Um, and probably about 10% of sales, uh, I'm gonna say lost, I mean, um, I mean, we didn't lose them, it's all in the deliver the inventory because it's all on back order, probably about 10% on the international site, 
uh, that we're gonna see falling our, um, into Q4. 
Uh, already started shipping a lot of that, um, out of, um, out of the US, uh, warehouse, uh, because that stock is now all arrived and is now, is now moving through the network. 
Um, so about 20% in the US, and about 10%, uh, um, international. Okay, perfect. 
Thank you very much. And the next question is regarding the professional fees, which were up, uh, 182% during the quarter, 
uh, due to increase in product liability litigation settlement. Uh, 
I guess this is probably a one time, uh, event, and that should not repeat in, in the coming quarters? 
Yes, that is correct. So there was a settlement of, um, of one of our trials. 
Um, and, um, we should not see that, uh, we certainly don't know of any other, um, areas we can, 
where we are, um, litigating now, uh, where can expect any settlement, uh, like that. 
Uh, so in Q4, I definitely do not expect to see, um, anything like that. Um, and hopefully, there are no further trials that come up. 
That's perfect. Yeah, we all hope so 
<laugh>. And then my, my final question would be, uh, on your new, uh, sustainability, uh, line that you are launching, uh, the 2022. Uh, 
I would just like to know, uh, how long have you been working on this line and what has been the market reception, 
uh, to something that I, I think is incredibly innovative and looks very cool? 
Um, firstly, thank you, Olivia. We've been working on it for about three years now. Uh, you know, just planning how we're gonna, uh, release it, 
of course. Um, you know, at the moment, it is, um, it is a few products, uh, that are in the line. 
Um, and over time, we hope to, we obviously hope to grow, um, that line of products, 
um, and, um, you know, just to 
become, uh, more sustainable. It 
is something that we, that we do take very seriously at Leatt. We realize, uh, that we've all got a responsibility, uh, towards, uh, sustainability and becoming more. um, eco-friendly. 
Uh, so step by step, uh, we are, um, you know, working on increasing that. Uh, taken about three years to get to where we are, but of course, now, 
uh, you know, we do have the technology, we have the, the capabilities, we have the suppliers available to expand this, 
and we are planning on expanding it, uh, quite quite quickly. 
Uh, we've also now, uh, have, um, full, uh, eco packaging. So all of the packaging that we're sending around the world now, 
um, is, uh, fully eco-friendly, uh, using things like Soy Inc, uh, and, uh, products that, uh, that are not harmful to the environment. 
So that is Leatt, we've been working on also about two years now. 
And that's been a huge change for us. Of course, a lot has to be done in order to put that in place, but we are relieved that we are now in a position where we can say that all of our packaging, uh, is eco-friendly. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Do, do you think, uh, this eco packaging is, is, is a higher cost for you or does it lower your cost on the packaging in general? 
Uh, we're talking packaging. Packaging in general. 
Yes, just packaging. So, um, I mean, it's, yeah. Um, you know, so, so it, it, it's pretty much break even. 
And there might be a slight, in some areas, there might be a slight increase, um, um, in cost, but generally when you go down the eco road, 
um, you know, you do see some cost increases, but then things become, um, you know, there's less colors, 
um, there's less, um, you're limited to certain materials, 
um, um, which, which decrease your costs. 
So it, it, it's pretty much break even, maybe slightly higher, um, in some areas. 
Okay. That's perfect. crosstalk. Of course, uh, if you're talking about, um, yes. Yeah. Please, please go on. Sorry. 
I was just gonna say that if you're talking about on the, on the product side, with the sustainable materials that we are using on the product side, 
uh, those are a bit more expensive, 
but, uh, you know, consumers, some consumers, um, are willing to pay a bit of a premium, uh, knowing that they're using, uh, materials, um, that are cutting edge like that. 
That's great. Okay. So thank you very much for taking my questions, uh, today, um, and congratulations once more on the great work, and looking forward for the rest of the year. Oh, thank you, Olivia. It's always, always a pleasure hearing from you. 
We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Sean Macdonald for closing comments. 
Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you about our 2021 year, the year performance in the spring. 
This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.
