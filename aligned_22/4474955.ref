Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. 
Amid fast-evolving market conditions in the third quarter, we continued to execute prudent 
operational strategy in our cash credit business, 
ensuring our asset quality at a, a stable level. 
The transactions volume for our loan book business decreased sequentially 
by 2.1% to 3.4 billion 
RMB in t- this quarter. 
And our on-balance sheet loan balance decreased 
sequentially by 14.4% to three billion RMB. 
During the quarter, we continued to make steady progress with our WLM KIDS business. 
As of December 12, 2021, 
we had seven centers operating in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, 
all deli- delivering high-quality extracurricular 
activities, services, and the products to children and families. 
The ramp-up of WLM KIDS center is slower than expected due to COVID-19 
resurgence. 
We are continuing to closely monitor ongoing COVID-19 conditions and proactively 
taking precautionary measures as our highest priority 
to ensure the safety and healthy of the children, 
families, and staff in our centers. 
We also fully support the recent government regul- regulatory changes announced, announced 
for the supple- supplemental learning industry 
and will strictly comply with the applicable regulations. 
Moving forward, we will continue to focus on improving the quality of our products and service, 
while also exploring new investment and business opportunities. 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Sissi for more details in… on our results. 
Thank you, Min. And good morning and good evening, everyone. 
Echoing Min on our loan book business, we continued to uphold rigorous standards for credit approvals in the third quarter. 
We focused new loan origination on better quality borrowers with stronger credit profiles, and our D1 delinquency rate 
continued to remain below 5% at the end of the quarter. 
Additionally, more than 99% of our outstanding loans balance were funded by our own capital, 
and our M1+ Delinquency coverage ratio remained high at 2.3 times. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to prudently operate our cash loan business while simultaneously pursuing new potential growth channels. 
Supported by our strong balance sheet, 
we believe we can continue to grow our overall business and deliver sustainable value to our shareholders over the long term. 
Now, let me share with you some key financial results. In the interest of time, I will not go over them line by line. 
For a more detailed discussion of our third quarter 2021 results, please refer to our earnings press release.

of 59.1% from RMB 849.4 million for the third quarter of 2020. 
Our financing income 
totaled RMB 285.5 million, representing a decrease of 41.4% from RMB 487 million

Loan facilitation income and other related income decreased by 95% to RMB 8.8 million from 
RMB 177 million for the third quarter of 2020, 
as a result of the reduction in transaction volume of off-balance sheet loans during this quarter. 
Transaction services fee and other related income increased to RMB 20.9 million from RMB 6.6 million for the third quarter of last year, 
mainly as a result of the reassessment of variable consideration. 
Sales income and others decreased to RMB 7.3 million from RMB 139 million for the third quarter of 2020,

which we are in the process of winding down. 
Sales commission fee decreased by 55.5% to RMB eight million from 
RMB 18 million for the third quarter of 2020 due to the decrease in the amount of merchandise credit transactions.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 49.3% to RMB 32.9 million 
from RMB six, 64.8 million for the third quarter of last year,

as a result of the increase in staff salaries primarily relating to WLM KIDS business.

million from RMB 51 million for the third quarter of last year, as a result of the decrease in staff salaries.

With that, I will conclude my prepared remarks. We will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead 
Certainly. Participants who wish to ask a question please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. 
If you would like to withdraw your question, please press the pound or hash key. 
For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask your question to the management in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. 
It's star followed by one to ask your question. Thank you. 
Your first question comes from the line of Frank Zheng from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Thank you, management, for taking my questions. Uh, this is Frank Zheng from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is on the WLM KIDS program. 
Uh, could you please provide more color on what's, uh… How many more in the pipeline maybe in the next year? 
And also, how is the payback period apply currently a- as well as the unit economics? 
And the second question is on cost revenue. Uh, I noticed that on sequential basis, cost revenue increased, 
can you maybe, uh, break down a little bit on what's driving the increase? Thank you. 
Thank you, Frank. Thanks for the questions. Um, so, to address your first question with regard to our WLM KIDS business. 
Um, we actually had three centers in operation during the third quarter and seven centers now. There will be over 10 centers in the pipeline for next year. 
Um, the performance, as we mentioned in our prepared remark, re- remarks, it's not as good as we expected because of the on and off regional COVID breakout. 
Um, you know, when we see positive COVID cases in the city, kids' activity centers are the first ones to be shut down and the last ones to be reopened. 
And therefore, our centers, um, have been shut down for almost, uh, two-month period during the third quarter, um, because of COVID. 
Um, so, um, our, um… A- and once a center g- got closed down, um, because of COVID, we need another two or three months to heat it up again. 
It's really hard to answer the question regarding to payback period and, um, the, the stabilized UE because we, we are not in that stage yet. 
Um, and, um, and our, our current imminent goal is to bring our centers to breakeven points as soon as possible 
before we do any further expansion. 
Um, I hope that answers questions. 
With regard to our cost of revenues… Uh, just one moment, moment please. 
So, the cost of revenues because we didn't provide, um, the breakdowns in, in our, um, 
uh, earnings as the segment reporting is not required under certain accounting rules. 
But, um, the, the majority of the, um, increase of, uh, cost of revenues 
is because of, uh, you know, we, um… W- when we, when we, when we do the WLM KIDS business, we 
have to hire teachers and instructors in our centers. 
So, their costs are, are in the cost of revenue. I hope that answers question. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Once again, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone. <silence> Thank you. 
As there are no further questions now, I would like to turn the call over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you. 
So, thank you everyone once again for joining us today, today. Um, it's a relatively short call. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact our investor relations team. Thank you. 
Thank you. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you. Thank you all.
