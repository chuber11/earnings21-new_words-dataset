Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to share with you the results of our first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Our revenue continues to accelerate on a constant currency basis fueled by strong bookings from prior quarters, 
along with continued demand for our digital services and business solutions. 
In addition, we delivered double digit TPS growth despite a strong Canadian dollar causing headwinds in our reporting currency. 
We reported revenue of 3.1 billion dollars, up 6.8% year-over-year on the constant currency basis. 
Strong constant currency growth was seen in the following segments: Asia Pacific up 19.5%; 
Western and Southern Europe, up 15.2%; 
US commercial and State government, up 14.5%; 
Central and Eastern Europe, up 11.9%; and Canada, up 8eight. 3%. 
Total bookings were 3.6 billion dollars, representing a book-to-bill of 116.5% for the quarter and listing our trailing 12 months book-to-bill to 115.2% 
compared to 103% for the prior year. 
I would like to call out a few segments with strong bookings in the quarter: 
Scandinavia at 117%; the UK and Australia at 122.%; 
and Finland, Bowland, and Baltics with a book-to-bill of 353%, 
driven by our new eight-year managed services contracts fined with the finished government whereby CGI will serve as the largest provider of hybrid IT services 
to dozens of public sector organizations. 
In addition, yesterday, we announced an award by the US Department of Justice for a $250 million US Dollar blanket purchase agreement 
with the first task quarter already granted, for a value of $134 million US Dollars for approximately $170 million in Canadian dollars. 
Out of our eight proximity geographic segments, six now have a trailing 12 months booked to bill well above 100%. 
New business was 33% of bookings, an increase from the previous year's 28%. 
On a trailing 12 months basis, new business was also 33% as compared to 26% for the year ago period. 
Our global backlog increased to… by $808 million dollars year-over-year and remains strong at $23.6 billion dollars. 
This backlog represents 1.9 times revenue, the vast majority of which is comprised of longterm managed services and digital transformations engagements. 
Given the continued increased demand for our services as reflected by the strong bookings in the last few quarters, we expect continued positive momentum. 
On the profitability front, adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was $521.5 million dollars, while EBITDA margins increased to 16.9%, up 50 basis points compared to Q1 last year. 
The year-over-year increase inaudible was mainly due to revenue growth in IT services and solutions 
and improved utilization primarily within the Western and Southern Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and US Federal segments. 
In addition, we continue to benefit from stronger margins due to operational excellence. 
We delivered strong EBITDA margins in the following segments: Asia Pacific at 32.1%; 
Canada at 25.6%; UK and Austria la at 15.8%; and Western and Southern Europe at 15.4%. 
Due to the strength of our value proposition to clients, and our embedded indexation clauses 
with our co… uh, with- within our contracts, we have largely been able to absorb wage and other cost pressures in our pricing. 
Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 25.5% compared to 25.9% in the prior year. 
We continue to expect our tax rate for future quarters to be in the range of 24.5 to 26.5%. 
Net earnings were $367 million dollars and inaudible earnings per share were $1 
dollar and .49 cents, representing an increase of 12.9% year-over-year. 
This improvement was mainly due to revenue growth and EBITDA margins improvements as outlined earlier. 
Excluding inaudible costs, net earning were $369 million dollars, for a margin of 11.9% and inaudible earnings per share were $1 
dollar and .50 cents, an incretion of 12.8% when compared to $1 dollar and .33 cents in the same quarter last year. 
End of quarter, cast provided by operating activities were… was $484 million dollars 
compared to $597 million dollars in the prior year, which had reviews of our inaudible compensation payments related to the impact of the pandemic. 
As a prospectus of revenue, our cash iteration was strong at 15.7%. The 
DSO was four… 45 days compared to 44 days last year, aligned with our targets. 
For the last 12 months, cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion dollars, or 16.4% of revenue. 
This represents $8 dollars and .02 cents in cash per share. 
End of quarter, we invested $206 million dollars in our build and buy profitable growth strategy, 
mainly in, uh, our IT and for the acquisition of inaudible Management Consulting and inaudible. 
In addition, we used $267 million dollars to buy back our stock. 
Buying back CGI stock has been an accretive and flexible way to return capital to shareholders. 
As such, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved the extension of the NCIB Program until February 2023, 
allowing us to purchase up to 18.8 million shares over the next 12 months. 
In addition, we reimbursed $250 million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments in the quarter, 
leaving only $50 million US dollars of scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of fiscal 2022. 
For the assurance of our senior notes in September 2021, 
CGIs weighted average maturity is now 4.9 years, with 100% 
fixed interest, uh, fixed interest rate at very favorable rates. 
Consistent with previous years, we review our capitals allocation plan to formulate the most effective capital deployment strategy to maximize shareholder returns. 
In Q1, we delivered a return on invested capital of 15.3%, 
a significance increase when compared to fif… 12.4% in the year ago period, returning to pre-pandemic levels. 
Looking ahead, as… and as indicated during our Investor Day this past November, 
our cash allocation priority remains the same; investing in our business, pursuing accretive acqu- acquisition, and buying back our stock. 
With a net debt to capitalization ratio of 27.8% at the end of December, 
as well as $2.7 billion dollars of cash readily available, and access to more if needed, 
CGI has the strength and capital resources to support our build and bi-profitable growth strategy. 
Now, I will turn the call to George to further discuss the insights and also for our business end markets. George. 
Thank you, Francois, and good morning everyone. 
I am pleased with our teams strong first quarter financial performance. 
We started fiscal year 2022 with positive momentum in all key metrics: 
double digit EPS accretion; accelerated revenue growth on a year-over-year and substantial quarter basis; 
robust bookings for the quarter in the last 12 months; and cash from operations of 15.7% for the quarter. 
The continued strength of our financial performance is grounded in our consultants ability to earn clients trust every day. 
This is evident in our modernization and digitization wins in the quarter. For example, Fannie Mae extended our longterm partnership in the US. 
We were awarded new work to support their migration to the Cloud 
and implement intelligent automation and data analytics across all consumer and commercial lines of business. 
inaudible, a 
recognized pioneer in health and care and social services in Finland 
has expanded their relationship with CGI to assist in completing their Goggle Cloud-based transformation. 
This engagement aims to help optimize costs and increase business agility. 
The Quebec Government selected CGI to help them establish and operate a new government Cloud for the next three years. 
On completion, this Cloud environment will be delivering services to multiple government agencies serving over eight million citizens. 
Elektroskandia, the Swedish electrical wholesaler which is a company of Sonepar, the world's largest electrical products, systems, and services firm 
named CGI as their digital transformation partner to support their modernization efforts, including the implementation of SAP S/ 4 HANA. 
The French Agency for ecological transition chose CGI to deliver application services, agile scale, and 
DevOps to help modernize their take… technology capabilities and services, supporting over three million businesses. 
And in the UK, the University of Nottingham awarded CGIs a new consulting services agreement. 
Through this partnership, we'll help modernize their digital value chain and support of learning services for over 45,000 students and 7,000 employees. 
Our robust bookings in the quarter were led by awards from government sector clients, 
up 28% year-over-year, for a book-to-bill of 151%. 
We expect this uptick to continue given the governments around the world are reprioritizing their IT initiatives 
in line with the evolving public health and economic environment. 
On a sequential quarter basis, we also saw demand accelerate in the financial services sector, 
resulting in a nearly 40% increase in Q1 bookings and a book-to-bill of 114%. 
This was driven by client demand for digital services across all geographic segments. 
In addition to our strong performance, clients continue to recognize the depth and breadth of our knowledge and expertise, 
resulting in all time high client satisfaction scores. 
Notably, our two highest client satisfaction scores measure how we partner with clients; specifically, our level of commit, collaboration, and communication. 
These qualities are key elements of the world class delivery excellence for which CGI is known. 
In fact, client executives often raise these qualities as some of the most important priorities for their partner selection 
and site them as differentiators for CGI. 
As a people center firm, we also recognize that our success is founded on the strength of our consultants and professionals, 
85% of whom are CGI shareholders. 
Our employee satisfaction scores also continue to be it record high levels. 
This is primarily due to our ongoing investments in digital tooling, self and wellbeing, and employee development. 
These are critical elements to provide rapid career growth for our talented employees and are therefore instrumental to our overall employee retention. 
As such, our voluntary attrition rates remains below the IT services industry average. 
Now as outlined during our recent Investor and Market Analyst Day, 
client demand for end-to-end digitization remains the key driver for CGIs planned profitable growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
During that meeting we shared four areas of investment with annual and three year objectives. 
First and foremost, an industry knowledge to help clients in their quest to build their right future. 
In technology expertise to support them… bright future and technology expertise to support them in building it right 
and offering intellectual property assets, enabling them to build with speed. 
And finally, the operational excellence to help clients operate and evolve their planned future estate. 
Today I'll provide updates on each of these areas, starting with the right industry knowledge. 
We announce our plan to grow strategic business and IT consulting services revenue by 15 to 20% on 
a compound annual growth rate basis over the next three years. 
In the quarter, we saw an uptick in consulting in the systems integration demand as bookings increase by over $100 million compared with this time last year. 
This is due, in part, to the expansion of our local consulting practices and related increased investment in hiring and developing industry expertise. 
In fact, we are finalizing a new white paper which consolidates input from our board of directors, CGI industry experts, 
and external alliance partners to explore the key trends that will impact and shape the long-term trajectories of most global industries. 
Our consultants will be sharing this paper with our clients to help inform their strategic planning, and we will then discuss with clients how CGI can best support their business objectives. 
Our next area of investment, technology expertise, helps clients balance the potential technology with the reality of complex enterprise delivery. 
We previously announced our fiscal 2022 plan to increase employee training and digital technologies by 33%. 
A key mechanism for supporting this plan is CGI's online university, worth 35% of employees completed courses in Q1. 
This training enables rapid reskilling and upskilling in areas of high demand, which is scaled agile and cloud technologies. 
Also, in support of our technical expertise investment, we plan to add over 15,000 employee certifications of global alliance partner solutions over the next three years. 
So far this year, we've already surpasses 2,100 of these certifications. 
This has contributed to a 15% increase in bookings with our global alliance partners on a year over year basis. 
Leveraging our investments in intellectual property, we also announced our plan to reach 30% of our revenue derived from IP by 2025. 
In the first quarter, IP services and solutions accounted for 22% of revenue, up from 21% last quarter. 
Investments in IP globally are focused on deploying new value add capabilities across the existing IT portfolio 
as well as investing to cocreate with clients on new innovations for bringing in greater value to clients' digital transformation and add to CGI's IT portfolio. 
Most importantly, our plans for operational excellence are a critical elements our clients are looking for, 
not only for us to be a safe pair of hands, but also for us to deliver in a cost-efficient manner. 
The support delivery and operational excellence objectives, the three-year plan we announce includes increasing head 
account by 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis across all of our global delivery centers particularly in India. 
In Q1, our current hiring pace in India is almost two and a half times more than before the pandemic. 
This hiring contributed to the 20% year to year growth in our Asia Pacific operations. 
Given CGI's strong value proposition, our attrition rate in India stands well below the India peer group average. 
For our ability to deliver these results is ensuring we have the right talent in both our client proximity and global delivery operations. 
Over the past few months, we've continued to evolve our hiring strategies to meet increasing client demand. In 
Q1, the number of new hires more than doubled compared to this time last year. 
The end of the quarter, with 82,000 employees, a year-over-year net increase of 6,000 consultants and professionals. 
We continue to employ an effective and efficient talent attraction and onboarding approach, 
with two-thirds of candidates coming directly to CGI 
either through referrals from current employees or through direct applications for open positions on cgi.com. 
In addition, to support our proactive recruiting outreach, we've increased our recruiting capacity across all operating units. 
Our operational leaders, the same leaders who are responsible for client delivery, are involved in candidate sourcing, assessment, and decision-making at every step of our hiring process. 
This ensures tight alignment between candidate skills and client needs and reduces overall time to fill open, fillable positions. 
In moving to the growth outlook for the rest of the year, we expect client demand for end to end digitization to continue accelerating across most of the key industries we serve. 
In government, as I stated earlier, we see positive client demand momentum, particularly in areas well aligned to CGI's positioning and offerings. 
This includes helping agencies address, arrange a domestic priorities, 
spanning social and health services, infrastructure, space-based data solution, environment and the climate, and cybersecurity. 
In manufacturing, supply chain disruptions continue to require reshaping and reconfiguration. 
This is driving demand for data-driven enterprises 
to improve service quality and generate new revenue streams through use of digital services, including AI and advanced analytics. 
In retail and consumer services, the permanent shift to more digital orders is requiring prioritization of omni channel 
investments, while supply chain challenges are creating pressure on customer service and loyalty, 
driving demand of AI and predictive analytics to improve forecasting, inventory management, and workforce planning. 
And in financial services, banks are aggressively implementing their digital transformational agendas 
to better understand their customers and improve organizational performance. 
Banking client initiatives now often include, if not hinge on 
faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency… 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, Faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency, 
include, if not hinge on, faster modernization of legacy assets, advanced data analytics, and a need for greater operational efficiency. 
That, um, decision, um, is that maybe a function of just, you know, the, the many opportunities that you see as inaudible cap allocation for the upcoming year? 
Yeah, thanks, inaudible. It's Francois. I'll take this one. 
Uh, you're right, uh, you know, and, and that's, uh, what we indicated, uh, at the, uh, investor day. 
You know, uh, we feel that, you know, the acquisition and many activities, uh, uh, will be a lot more active this year. Uh, we're talking a- about allocating a billion, 
uh, on, on this, and, and that we're on a right path, uh, for now, so, so, uh, and what we're seeing is that, uh, we, we think that we'll be able to achieve at this objective. 
So, uh, that's why we thought that, again, uh, to wait, uh, uh, again, for, for the dividend. 
Uh, we as, as indicated, uh, we did, uh, we will renew our NCIB, 
so, uh, you know, if needed, we will put some, some investment in the, uh, in the short buyback. 
But, uh, we think that the, you know, uh, versus this, versus last year, uh, a lot more in the inaudible. Okay. Uh, thank you, Francois. 
George, crosstalk could you just talk a little bit? You, you touched in it in the comments on the IP solutions, 
but maybe talk about where you've been and, and the journey of sort of globalizing more of the solutions. I know 
about a year ago this time, you started down that path. 
Maybe give us an update on how you see things trending. 
Yup, no, it's a, it's a great question, because, uh, you're right. We, uh, I call it our, our unified approach to, uh, to growing IP, and, 
uh, it really is 
first and foremost about having processed the methodology to propagate 
the existing IP across the entire, uh, channel of, uh, CGI. 
So, uh, this is everything from approved value proposition through add-ons to our existing IP, 
broader target market, across industries, geographies, and functions in, 
and having a, a more efficient and, uh, profitable, uh, delivery model. So just to give you a quick update in the quarter, 
uh, we do have over 10% increase in the pipeline. 
We have an over 10% increase in the deal size of the bookings that we have. 
So that's… that gets to that, uh, improved value, uh, 
proposition and that broader, uh, delivery mechanism, and then we have an over 10% increase in the win rate. 
So those are some nice early proof points, um, that say that what we're doing around that propagation is, uh, is working. 
Uh, in fact, we have three of our SBUs that are art the 30%, 
and, uh, and the two fastest growing are the ones that are under 10%. So we have a, 
we have opportunity and, uh, and of course, uh, propagating that IP is the way to get there. 
Uh, we're also making increased investments in the sourcing the new IP. 
So this is, uh, everything from ideation from our industry experts, so that's, uh, that's showing some, uh, some signs of, uh, of opportunity, cocreating with clients. 
Sometimes we actually cocreate and acquire the IP from our clients. Sometimes we actually just cocreate and jointly own it 
and everything in it between. That's where a lot of our best IPs actually came from. And so we, uh, we're doing that across, uh, the global CGI now. 
And then as I mentioned in the, uh, opening remarks, uh, 
MNA, uh, is, is an area where we're gonna be looking at, um, uh, IP services and solutions firms, 
uh, not just software only but services and solutions firms. Uh, we're opening the, uh, the aperture to more of that and our MNA. 
So, uh, you know, early returns are, are coming, and, uh, we're, we're bullish on the future. 
Great. And then just the one final one from me, just around maybe more quarterly matters here, either you or Francois. 
Could you talk about… you mentioned client contract adjustments 
mainly in the UK and Australia. You mentioned a little bit in Scandinavia, but just, you know, obviously, this is always sort of a inaudible, but where 
we are in the process of sort of running off, um, maybe those adjustments for those engagements and ramping other stuff. 
Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, thanks, I'll, I'll take it, 
uh, Paul. So, so for, for UK, clearly, it was a, you know, a one… a nonrecurring adjustment that, 
uh, had an impact on, on their, uh, on their growth and contribution. So, so that's behind us, 
and, and so you can expect, uh, to, to, to have a margin and, and the revenue picking up in the next, uh, few quarters in for UK. 
And, and same thing for, for, uh, in, in the, 
uh, Scandinavia, we, we, we have some, some, you know, operational issue that we need to resolve in, in Scandinavia, but we had also nonrecurring, uh, one-time adjustment that, uh, 
uh, are, uh, behind us and, uh, expecting that, uh, also there 
we'll see some, some growth in the contribution. 
Perfect. Thank you. 
It's our next call. The next question comes from Richard C. from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead. 
Hello. Can you hear me? crosstalk Yeah, we can hear you now, Richard? <laugh> Uh, just, uh, wanted to get 
a bit of perspective 
in terms of the, the operating level of a, of a business, you know, compared to pre-pandemic. 
Like, are utilization rates, um, kind of back to where they've been? Like, I'm try- trying to get a bit of understanding on that. 
Yeah, um, actually, our utilization rates are a little bit stronger 
than they were, uh, pre-pandemic. 
Uh, and, and part of that is that, uh, the strong demand, uh, side that we see, but also the opportunity we took, 
uh, right at the beginning of the, uh, pandemic to take the actions that we felt necessary. 
So, uh, we, we measure the utilization on a weekly basis. 
Uh, obviously not just with reports but in a call that I have with all the operating leaders. 
So, uh, we're very focused on it, and, and I'm pleased to, to tell you that it's, uh, it's actually a little bit above where we were pre-pandemic. Okay. 
And then, um, obviously, you're in pretty constant contact with your accounts and clients. 
What are they saying about IT budgets, 
um, going into 2022, you know, particularly, you know, how-… um, going into 2022, you know, particularly, you know, how much higher they are or lower they are, and kind of areas of priorities where they wanna spend. 
Yeah, it's a, it's a good question. Obviously. Uh, everybody's got, uh, slightly different, uh, planning periods. But, 
uh, in general, uh, in, in areas like financial services, we see, uh, those budgets continuing to, to go up. And, and across the board, the focus is on both, uh, growing their revenue, but, and using technology to help do that. And, uh, and, and some client facing, uh, solutions in, in their, uh, in their IT budgets, 
but also focused on that operational efficiency. 
Uh, we hear our clients t- talking about, they have, 
uh, they're dealing with, uh, the current, uh, economic, uh, uh, pricing pressures and, and looking to make sure that they stay competitive 
through operational efficiencies. Technology, as you know, plays on both sides. It plays on the, 
uh, on the upside, on the revenue side, but technology also plays on the, uh, operational efficiencies. 
So we, we see a pretty strong environment for, uh, for IT. 
And, uh, I've been talking for a while, 
Richard, this, uh, you know, this wasn't just pent up demand that we saw, uh, coming out of the, the pandemic. It's, it's, it's something we think is sustainable from an IT perspective. 
Okay. And just one last quick one for me. 
Uh, you know, on the acquisition side, uh, you talked about opening up the aperture for technology. 
Historically, uh, you guys have been more sort of value conscious. And so when you look at, you know, technology type deals, no doubt the, uh, evaluations are certainly a bit more robust, 
uh, despite maybe the pullback here at the beginning of the year. 
So, how, how do you look at sort of the relative valuation you're kind of willing to pay for these? And maybe give us a bit of perspective o- on that. 
Yeah. May- maybe I'll, I'll start, and then I'll ask, uh, Francois to, uh, to continue. Just to, to remind you, 
uh, we are looking to make these acquisitions accretive. And so, uh, we're, we're very conscious of not, uh, overpaying. 
Having said that, if the value is there, we're willing to pay higher multiples. So 
I don't know if Francois if- 
Yeah. Uh, and, and you know, where we're, to some point conservative in our acquisition where, you know, we, 
when we're building our return, we're building it a lot of times with, with cost energies, 
you know, for sure in IP, we need to, to, to be convinced that we will have revenue synergies and, and so meaning, uh, expecting, uh, rev- uh, a lot more revenue increase coming from, from these, uh, 
acquisition. And, and we have now the channel across the world to do what… 
So, so for sure, what we are looking at is IP that, uh, can be sold across the world, 
uh, without, no, too much changes. 
And, and so for sure, you know, 
it will be valued a bit more, but we naturally with the return that we think we can enable, we don't have any problem to, to pay, 
uh, to pay the, the right price. 
Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
Your next question comes from Paul Trevor from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Thanks very much, and good morning. crosstalk. 
I just wanna touch on, uh, you know, CGIs growth relative to, to the market in, in peers. And now maybe this is in an apples to apples comparison, 
um, but some of your peers have reported quite strong growth recently. 
I just wanted your thoughts on, you know, what's your view on CGIs growth, 
you know, just relative to those peers and, and the market? And do you feel like, you know, you're matching, you're exceeding, um, or, or lagging the, the, the growth of peers in the markets that you're in? 
Yeah, thanks for the question, uh, Paul. 
Look, we, we like where we are in our profitable revenue growth, 
uh, current landscape, but also where where we're, where we're headed towards. 
Uh, very, very proud of the fact that, uh, we've been able to take this, the, 
uh, growth that we are achieving both, uh, through the build and the buy and, uh, and drop that to earnings, uh, per share accretion double digits here in the first quarter. So we, we like where we are on, uh, where we're getting that growth and, uh, and what the outlook is. And you see that outlook based on the, uh, the strong book the bill again, this quarter and for the trailing 12 months. 
So, we feel like we're in a very good, um, uh, position to continue to, uh, accelerate our growth through both the build and the buy. 
And, uh, and like I said, our clients are rewarding us for that with, uh, new work. 
And, uh, and also in, uh, in the scores, satisfaction scores are giving us, which translates to future new 
work. 
So, uh, we, we feel like we're in a very good, uh, good place there. 
And just looking at, you know, the, the growth, uh, in your employees, uh, offshore, so India, 
um, you know, you mentioned that that's, uh, uh, reflective the demand that you're seeing. 
So, you know, can you speak to like the, your clients, are they in- increasingly prioritizing offshore versus what they did in the past? 
And what's the underlying driver of that? Is it, is it cost, is there, is there something else that's, that's driving the capabilities perhaps? No, 
I think, uh, I think, uh, for, for a lot of reasons, there's some in, uh, some companies that hadn't gone to leveraging offshore. 
And when the pandemic happened and everybody went remote, both, uh, both onshore and offshore, 
it, it gave them a view that maybe some of that, uh, some of that could work. And so I think it's just some catch up by, uh, by some of those players. I, 
I'd add at the same time, uh, given the pandemic, those that were heavily, heavily in offshore, uh, looked to rebalance some of that. 
So, but, but on average, you know, if you're, if you're rebalancing some of it versus you're going from zero to, to something, uh, the, the, the moved offshore is outweighing it. 
It's also that operational efficiency. 
There's the, there, there are operational efficiencies, uh, to be gained in, uh, in, in leveraging offshore. And, and of course that's, uh, given kind of what the outlook is for, for cost. Uh, we see some of that. 
But, you know, it's, uh, it's something that, uh, will continue to, uh, to leverage. Uh, and, and just to remind you, we're gonna stay true to our proximity model, 
even as we leverage global delivery. 
Yeah, thank you. I'll pass the line. Yep. Your next question comes from Stephanie Price from CIBC. Please, go ahead. 
Good morning. Hi, Stephanie. Hi. Um, 
I was hoping that you could touch just on the percentage booking from new clients. It was very strong in the quarter. Just curious about what's driving the strength and if you've made any changes for the sales process. 
Yeah. Thanks. Uh, thanks Stephanie. 
As I mentioned, we have made investments on, uh, on the talent side and, uh, in both the technology, 
uh, reskilling, upskilling, and also the certifications, as I mentioned on alliance partners. 
So that gives us another channel, uh, to, uh, to reach some of the, the newer clients. 
Also, we're making investments on the, uh, industry expertise and the consulting skills. 
That's another new avenue for us to, uh, generate, uh, those new clients. So those are kind of two of the, uh, investments that, that we've been making 
and will continue to make that's, uh, that's driving some of those, uh, those new client logos. Thanks. 
And then maybe one, uh, for Francois. Cash flow came in a little bit below street expectations in the quarter and a little bit below prior years percentage revenue. 
Just curious if you could talk about what it takes here and how we should be thinking about modeling cashflow for the rest of the year. 
Yeah. So thanks. Uh, Stephanie for a question. Uh, yeah, as I indicated, you know, uh, last year we had a very strong cashflow close to 600 million just in a quarter. 
And, and really was the fact that last year, because of COVID, you know, we had a lot less, uh, uh, bonuses, uh, year end bonuses to pay last year, uh, in the first quarter. 
So, uh, versus 2021, where we had the, you know, uh, a way better year on, on bonuses and that had an impact on the quarterization or the, the cash coming from, from the first quarter. 
We're still, uh, I'm still convinced that, uh, we'll be capable to generate, uh, you know, the, the right level of cash, like last year and even perhaps a bit better than last year. 
Uh, so, so, uh, you know, it's, it's just a timing, uh, on the cash side, 
but, uh, you know, still, still pretty… And you saw the DSO, uh, at 45 days, 
and it's, I think now it's the last five or six quarters, uh, that, that we are at our target of DSO. So, uh, 
pretty, uh, a pretty comfortable where we are with the cash generation. That's helpful color. 
Thank you. And, and your next question comes from Howard Leung from Veritas. Please, go ahead. 
Th- th- thank you so much for, uh, for taking the questions. Uh, I, 
I'll just like to start with, um, the one about IP, uh, George, you mentioned that, um, you know, of the ways you're developing IP 
and this has been for a while, is to work, work with clients. 
And just wanted to get a sense of what, uh, how, how that's structured and how you share the costs. Um, 
I know before, you know, you, you did this a long time ago with, with the big banks in Canada. And now, now as you're evolving 
and, and working with more clients outside of Canada, how we inaudible evolving as well? Thanks. 
Yep. No, thanks for the, for the question, Howard. It, it really does, uh, uh, vary. 
Um, the, the most, uh, the most typical, 
uh, opportunity though that we see is that the client, uh, actually provides some of the, uh, some of the industry, 
uh, expertise, obviously the use case, if you will. 
And, uh, and, and of course then accelerates it through some of their, uh, quality assurance and, uh, and then piloting it. 
What they get from that is, uh, first mover status. 
And, uh, and then of course we build some of those customizations and productize it, uh, with CGI's investment. 
And as a result, they, uh, they get the long term maintenance benefits. 
So, a lot of times it's really as simple as, uh, as that. 
And then they may pay us for some of the customizations directly and keep them outside of the product. 
And we're seeing that more and more. So there might be some, uh, some proprietary or specific elements that we decide up front would not go into the product, but they still get the leverage kind of the platform nature 
of the product. 
That's, that's typically the most, uh, the most, uh, uh, used, uh, o- opportunity that we, that we see. 
Others are, but we've done the other where we actually jointly put the money in. 
And, uh, and then we, we have a royalty, uh, scheme that goes back to the, the clients based on, uh, on new, uh, new wins. 
And of course, CGI in all cases owns the, the rights to the, uh, 
to the IP, but the, uh, but then the, uh, the client gets the, the rights to, to use it 
in, uh, in, in a, in a perpetuity. 
So that's, uh, that's typically how we, uh, how we see those. 
We also see sometimes its consortium. If it's a cost of doing business, which is kind of the opposite of, uh, first mover or proprietary nature of the, of the business, 
it might be a cost of regulatory cost of doing business. 
And everybody, 
uh, puts money in as equal partners, including CGI, but CGI, uh, runs, owns and operates the IP or the consortium. 
So we see kind of, um, multiple models. 
And, and that's pretty consistent across, uh, each of the geographies that we operate in. 
So that, that, that's a great explanation. Thanks for, uh, highlighting all the different- Yep. structures. 
Um, on the, uh, on, on, on the acquisitions, um, just looking at, um, the revenue contribution, you know, from array and, uh, CMC. And I know it's just one quarter, but, 
um, the, the multiples, you know, uh, they, they look, they look pretty good, I guess, compared to the, the past acquisitions. 
Is there anything you'd like to call out there 
and, um, is it just, you know, maybe it's just, uh, acquisition specific or is there some thing about, 
um, the valuations, um, that you're seeing in, in, in, um, in the, your, uh, targets? 
Yeah, well, valuations, uh, you know, as we know over the last, uh, couple years have, uh, have gone up 
and, uh, but we still are, are interested in finding valuations that, uh, that we can make 
accretive to CGI in that first year. 
And so, uh, yes, there, you do see some of that. I would say though, moving forward, we're seeing valuations starting to favor EBITDA over growth. 
And uh, I don't know, Francois- Yeah, no, e- exactly, George. I think, 
uh, we, we saw a stabilization of, of the, of the valuation. And, and, uh, George's right, this thing, a bit more, 
uh, you know, concentration on, on, on the, on the how much, uh, margin or EBI- 
or EBITDA that, uh, the, the company can bring in. 
So, so, uh, uh, yeah, we are seeing stabilization of it. And so, uh, the opportunities, uh, for us. 
Oh, yeah. That, uh, that makes sense given, uh, I guess what's been going on in the market past few weeks. Exactly. 
Um, yeah. Uh, and then just, maybe just one last one for Francois, um, just noticed the, uh, in the quarter of PP&D spending, you know, ticking up. 
Um, is that just kind of a return to normal, uh, um, you know, t- t- uh, investing again in physical facilities, or could you just put a little more color to that? 
Yeah, yeah. I, I bet the return to normal. You're, you're totally right. 
Uh, with, with, uh, you know, people that, 
uh, start to come back to the officers for, for sure, we, we started to do some, some investment in, in offices and all that. So, so that, that's a, that's a part of it. 
And, and some of it is also as, uh, as we know, with, with, uh, you know, the supply chain in, in some places that it's a little bit tougher, 
we, we can have some, a bit of swing from, from one quarter to the other, uh, with some of the delay. 
So, so both of them. So yes, some of it is just, uh, you know, uh, coming back to a, a normal investment level and some of it, you can have some seasonality just, uh, because of-… level. 
And some of it, you can have some seasonality just, uh, because of the… Some- some supply chains, uh, I… uh, issues. 
Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for the colorized, uh, I'll turn it back. 
Your next question comes from Kevin Kushner Abne from Busan Bank. Please go ahead. 
Uh, good morning, gentlemen. Can you hear me? 
Yes. Yep. Hi Kevin. Oh, awesome. Perfect. Good morning. 
Um, question for you, is there, is there any sort of way to think about your- your customer mix in terms of size, 
you know, sort of thinking about the split between enterprise mid-market, SMB, I'm wondering, 
you know, if maybe any recent change in focus, any opportunities or- or ability to take a greater share of IT spend from smaller versus larger customers and just how to 
investigate how would you think about the structure of your sales, uh, and consultant mix and the, uh, and the metro market strategy, 
uh, you know, just to be aligned with how you're seeing the various, uh, and, uh, customer end markets. 
Yeah, no, thanks Kevin. Uh, our- our focus is primarily on enterprise, uh, clients. 
Uh, 
we, uh, we feel that, uh, the value proposition that we can bring to them, the impact that we can have on them, 
uh, particularly given our global footprint and our end to end services is in fact, uh, greatest. And so 
that's really the- the primary focus. In fact, if you look at, uh, some of those recent, uh, M&A transactions, whether it's a Array, 
DMC and Unico, they all have, uh, that same, uh, makeup of, uh, you know, very large enterprise, 
at least one very large enterprise client that- that generates, uh, a lot of their revenue. 
Um, it does not mean that we do not, uh, take some of our IP and, uh, solutions to the, 
uh, the medium size business, not as much on the, on the small side. 
And, 
um… But- but it really, uh, the- the primary focus is on, uh, is on enterprise 
and those, uh, those accounts that we can, uh, really again, drive the, uh, the highest value. 
And I- I wanna make sure you- you recognize when we're talking about those metro markets, 
uh, those metro markets are where those enterprise, uh, companies, uh, are- are headquartered. It's not, 
uh, it's not, uh, looking at, uh- uh, at metro markets where, uh, it's only, uh, going after a smaller, medium sized, uh, company. 
Very good. Thanks- thank you for that explanation. 
Uh, maybe just one, uh, perhaps for prevent Sprintlaw. Uh, 
I know you don't disclose gross- gross margin. Can you talk about trends there? If I look year over year, the split of manager IT versus consulting, 
uh, is 50, 50, of this 50, 50 a year ago as well. 
Um, but what are you seeing on the, on sort of a gross margin, underlying trends, um, and how is that contributing to the, uh, to the EBIT, uh, outperformance? 
Well, wi- with gross margin is- is- is very good, uh, and- and improving since, uh- uh, since, uh, last- last year. 
Uh, like, uh, George alluded before, uh, utilization is very high, uh, so like contributing to- to- to the, to the gross, uh, margin. 
So, uh, they'll continue to be, uh, pretty, uh, pretty good on it. And SG&A, uh, with- with, uh, the- the concentrate, the automation that we're pushing more and more. 
A- and offshoring up of some of the SG&A activities 
is also, uh, improving year over year. And that's why you see, uh, the- the EBIT improvement. 
Super thanks very much. I'll, uh, I'll pass the line. Your next question comes from Daniel Chan from TD Securities. Please go ahead. 
Hi, good morning. Um, good to see that you guys are still able to grow your team and your employee attrition rates are lower than the industry average. 
Any- any color on why you're able to achieve this? Is it because you guys are paying more or is it based on the locations where you're, uh, operating out of any color would be helpful? 
Sure. Uh, well, I think the- the- the biggest reason for 
kind where we, uh, where we're able to- to- to do that is our employee value proposition. 
Uh, it includes significant stock ownership, the 85%. 
Uh, the- the investments we've been making in career development, the 33% increase in training development 
around rescaling et cetera. 
These- these are really some of the, uh, the- the- the reasons that, uh, that we have this, including our community involvement. Um, it is really a- an attractor there. 
But- but it goes one step further, we- we recognize that we're in a, uh, a unique environment. 
And so, um, we really focused on a few areas 
that, uh, to- to keep that, um, not just about the- the attrition down, but also the attraction up. 
And, uh, and what we're doing on the attraction side is- is really focused on who we recruit, uh, where we recruit and, uh, and how we recruit. 
And I think that's, uh, some of where you were talking about the, who we recruit, 
uh, higher concentration on college hires and also trainees that are coming from nontraditional IT environments. 
So that's, uh, that's about 20% of our hires. Now we have boot camps that then build the digital skills that they need. 
Where we recruit, yeah- yeah proximity and, uh, and offshore, but also those onshore delivery centers. 
That's a better place to- to recruit for us, and, uh, and then a lower turnover rate. And we have 39% of our hires came from, uh, global delivery. 
And then it's how we recruit, I've mentioned before that, uh, a third of our people come through employee referrals. 
Uh, they're- they're stronger, uh, attraction to- to CGI, but the people that refer them have a higher retention rate as well. 
Uh, so we're really, uh, you know, we're really, uh, making sure that we invest to not just rest on the- the employee value prep- proposition that we have, 
but continue to, uh, to build in this, uh, current environment. 
Thanks for that George. Uh, as a follow up to that, given that 20% of your hires are from non-traditional IT, and, 
uh, from, uh, relatively junior members from college, would you say that the ramp up time for these employees might take a little bit longer than typical? 
Although we do put them through, uh, we do put them through boot camps, so there is, uh, a little bit of a ramp up. And, uh, yet this is what we're doing today, 
and you see that, uh, we're still able to, uh, to deliver the utilization and margins that you, uh, you see in our results in this quarter. 
And yet, uh, that's probably another lever as they, uh, as they come on board to, uh, to- to increase, uh, the- the utilization and margin going forward. Okay. 
That makes sense. From… So you mentioned that you model, um, revenue synergies into your IP acquisitions, where it's typically you've typically looked to leverage, uh, value from cost synergies. 
How about market, uh, metro market modeling side two? When you're looking at metro market acquisitions, 
are you also starting to model in revenue synergies, given your view to bring in additional services, uh, as you make these acquisitions? 
Uh, for sure. And especially, you know, uh, when- when, uh, we're- we're investing 
in- in, uh, metro markets where we're not necessarily there. 
Uh, so most of the time it's because we want to buy, uh, relationships also and with clients and new clients. 
And- and so… And that's what we did in the past and in some places, 
uh, so, uh, you know, sometimes these, uh, smaller firms will have good relationship with- with large clients, 
but not having the full capabilities that CGI has. 
And so by- by coming and- and- and doing this merger, we are bringing the capabilities, uh, to- to, uh, to this metro market 
and- and with the relationship that we just, uh, bought, you know, we're capable to have some revenue synergies there. Great. 
Thank you. Julie. I think we've got time for one more question, please. 
Perfect. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Hey guys, this is Kathy Channon for Jason. Good morning. Uh, I'll just, you know, quickly slip into your questions. So my first one, I just wanted to ask, you guys obviously had pretty strong bookings this quarter. 
You know, I think it's the fourth quarter of like LTM book to bill, you know, greater than 1. 1. Can you just talk about, 
you know, very briefly, like the core drivers of this and the potential sustainability. So like, can we accept this trend to continue, 
you know, maybe at least for the next couple of quarters, given the strong demand from the environment that you guys, you know, are able to capitalize on. Thanks. 
Sure. Um, Kathy one- one of the, uh, areas I- I already talked about some of the investments 
that we're making to, uh… To drive some of the, uh, the new clients are particularly around the, uh, some of the- 
the digital skills and the global alliances, as well as the, uh, industry skills and, uh, some of the- the consulting 
growth. So that's, uh, that's one of the areas that's driving that is that, uh- uh, that mix of- of new clients that are coming in. 
Certainly IP as we move to, uh, to IP, uh, 30, uh, will give us, uh, an opportunity as we increase those deal size. I talk about some of the investments 
that we're making there to, uh, to- to, uh, to drive that. 
And then the last is really the operational excellence, 
you know, the- this, uh, drive to, um, uh, to- to efficient seized by our clients. 
Um, and a lot of that, uh, requires automation 
and the… that offshore mix. And what we're doing around our managed services offering is building modernization 
into the operational excellence, uh, platform. That's, uh, that's driving again, longer term larger deals. So, 
uh, we do believe that, uh, in- in this environment we'll be able to, uh, to sustain a strong book to bill. 
Okay, awesome. And then, you know, one final question from me. I know you- you guys have talked a lot about, you know, the consulting investments that you guys are making and, you know, during the Analyst Day, you guys talked about that 
15 to 20% revenue CAGR over the medium term. 
You know, your Unico acquisition, um, obviously both with your capabilities there as well. 
And while you don't really break apart bookings or revenues, like by consulting, you know, per se, you know, can you share any metrics on, you know, perhaps like how book to bill for consulting is trending 
or any other details there? Thanks guys. 
Yep. So, uh, we don't break that out, uh, now, so don't have that number in front of me. But I can tell you just in general, about 10% 
of our SI&C is now, um, in the C uh, in the consulting side. So, 
uh, we're- we're looking at, uh, that's kind of the- the basis of what we'd like to continue to grow. 
Okay, awesome. Thanks guys, take care.
