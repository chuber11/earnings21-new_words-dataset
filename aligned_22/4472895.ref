Thank you, Eric, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. 
Quhuo's total revenues grew by 44% year-over-year, reaching RMB1 .1 billion, in line with our prior guidance. 
All of our three main business lines, on-demand delivery, mobility, and housekeeping solutions, all enjoyed continued strong demand 
with our top line growth, 
outpacing that of the industry. 
Now let me walk you through our key business performance in Q3. 
First, let's look at our biggest revenue contributor, the on-demand delivery business. 
Its revenue reached RMB1 .05 billion, up 38% year-over-year, exceeding 
the RMB1 billion mark for the first time. 
For Q3, the aggregate number of delivery orders were 159 million, up 59% year-over-year. 
This growth rate was clearly faster than the industry average, 
showing our ability to quickly gain market share. 
This impressive result in our on-demand food delivery business were enabled by our strategy to aggressively penetrate into new cities and expand our service network. 
By Q3, we provided our on-demand delivery services in 1,231 business circles across 87 cities nationwide, 
compared with 1,067 business circles across 70 cities in the same period in 2020. 
In addition, we expand our coverage of serving chain merchants 
directly, including supermarkets and the chain restaurants. This so-called new retail business, 
gaining the strong momentum in Q3. 
We believe that the COVID-19 containment measures across China served as a positive catalyst 
for our clients in metro areas to adopt new ways to purchase living necessities. 
They place orders online and get instant delivery offline. 
This positions Quhuo were very well in capturing new business opportunities in this burgeoning segment, 
as evidenced by our community and the grocery delivery, 
enjoying explosive growth in Q3, with revenue up 262% year-over-year. 
Furthermore, our expanding network is enabling Quhuo to sustain our leading position on business scale and service quality, 
while also improve our operational efficiencies and cost structure. 
Moving to our Housekeeping Solutions business. Q3 revenues increased 538% year-over-year to RMB21 million, 
with a GMV of RMB462 million. 
We are pleased to announce that our Housekeeping Solutions has become our second largest business line. 
For our Mobility business, this strategic segment continued its strong growth in Q3, 
with revenues reaching RMB34 .6 million, up 364-65 % 
year-over-year and 35% quarter-over-quarter. 
Besides shared bike ride hailing starting July this year, we launched our freight service for industry customers 
by fulfilling end-to-end intra-city and the long distance transportation orders. 
We believe this is a very promising business with huge market potential. 
All above reflected our growing brand awareness and the resulting in market share gains in this lucrative category. 
Let me now provide another update on our exci- exciting multi-scenario deployment, 
wh- which enables gig workers to have multiple jobs on our platform to optimize their overall income. 
In Q3, the cumulative number of workers we engaged in two or more types of jobs on our platform 
reached about 2- 22,700, increasing 28% quarter-over-quarter. 
Female workers accounted for 16% of the total group, increasing from 10% in the previous quarter. 
For riders with an average monthly income of at least RMB5 ,000, 
they represented more than 54,000 workers, accounting for 51% of total group, flat with the previous quarter. 
In Q3, we would like also to highlight the importance of our aggressive investment in Quhuo's technology platform, 
reflected by doubling of our R&D, research and development, expenses from a year ago. 
We believe these expenditures will enhance our competitiveness by improving operational efficiency 
and service quality, while expanding our services to more sectors. 
A clear illustration of our progress on the technology front is the low out this quarter of our new Laizhenge platform, 
including our new family-oriented housekeeping services. 
Our goal is to extend our world-class housekeeping service capabilities from hotels and the restaurants to directly to home and the 
communities, the market size of which is expanded to reach the trading R&D level. 
The Laizhenge platform integrates intelligent expectation, robots, and sensors to monitor water and electricity consumption, 
which can effectively reduce the labor cost of property management, and improve efficiency and the service quality. 
With the adoption of this smart system by more property management companies, we will set up service stations near communities 
and fully utilize resources of the workers at hotels and the property management companies 
within five kilometers of service stations. 
Meanwhile, through cooperation with more property management companies, we can also mobilize 
our existing housekeeping workforce and our infrastructures to engage in the community housekeeping services, 
creating a win-win solutions for all parties. 
Finally, let me talk about our continued efforts in driving profitability in Q3. 
In spite of operating constraints from the strains of COVID-19 containment measures and with heightened competition, 
we were still able to achieve RMB19 million net income result in Q3, 
compared with a net loss of RMB10 million in the same period last year. 
Adjusted net income for Q3 was RMB28 million. 
The results reflected our commitment to sustainable profitability as we continued to advance our lucrative business model. 
This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Sandra, and who will discuss our financial results for the third quarter. Thank you. 
Thanks, Leslie. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Quhuo's third quarter 2021. 
Please be reminded that all amounts quoted here will be RMB unless stated otherwise. 
For this quarter, our total revenues were 1,105.5 million, representing an increase of 43.7% year-over-year, 
primarily due to the rapid growth of our major business lines. 
Revenues from on-demand delivery solutions were 1,047 million, 
representing an increase of 38% from 758.8 million in the third 
quarter of 2020, primarily due to the increase in the number of delivery orders were fulfilled as a result of the industry growth as our continued penetration and expansion into new geographic markets. 
Revenues from mobility service solutions consisting of shared bike maintenance, 
ride hailing, and the freight service solutions were 
34.6 million, representing an increase of 364.5% from 7.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, 
primarily due to our enlarged customer base as a service scope for shared bike maintenance solutions and, uh, the commencement of freight service solutions in July 2021. 
Revenues from housekeeping and accommodation solutions were 21.9 million, representing a significant increase of 538% from 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, 
primarily because we enlarged our customer base for housekeeping and accommodation solutions 
to include hotels and the B&Bs following our acquisition of Lailai and the Chengtu Home. 
Our cost of revenues were 1,055.1 million, representing an increase 53.2% year-over-year, primarily 
due to our business expansion, which resulted in increased costs, 
prop- proportionate to our revenue growth 
as the, the incremental hiring expenses and the higher, and equipment costs to expand the workforce on our platform 
and to secure additional resources in preparation for the anticipated increased demand of our solutions and our continuous business expansion plan in the first quarter. 
General and administrative expenses were 56.2 million, representing a decrease of 45.6% 
from 103.2 million in the third quarter of last year. 
The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in share-based compensation expenses from 72 million 
in the third quarter of last year to 9.1 million in third quarter of this year, 
primarily because we incurred substantial 
share-ba, share-based compensation expenses in the third quarter of 2020, as we satisfied the 
performance conditions of our share incentive award upon completion of our initial public offering, offering them. 
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses increased by 51% year-over-year, 
primarily due to the increase in staff cost, in line with the rapid 
growth of our housekeeping solutions and the professional service fees and expenditures in connection with our business expansion plan. 
Our research and development expenses were 6.3 million, 
representing an increase of 108.9% from 3 million in the third 
quarter of 2020, primarily due to the incurrence of outsourcing expenses to develop a new 
SaaS system for our housekeeping solutions, and the increase in staff cost as we enlarged our, our research and the development team. 
The operating loss was 19.3 million, compared to operating loss of 24 million in the third quarter of last year. 
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, 
the adjusted operating loss was 10.2 million, compared to adjusted operating profit of 48 million in the third quarter of 2020. 
We recorded other income net of 39.2 million, 
compared to other income net of 32.1 million in the third quarter of 2020, 
primarily due to the increase in fair value change of investments in mutual funds. 
We also recorded income tax benefit of 0.8 million, compared to income tax expenses of 15.8 million 
in the third quarter of 2020, 
primarily due to the lower estimated annual effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021. 
Net adjusted EBITDA was 35.1 million, compared to adjusted EBIT of 85.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. 
The adjusted net income was 28.2 million, 
compared to adjusted net income of 61.3 million in the third quarter of 2020. 
For the balance sheet, as of September 30, 2021, 
we had cash, short-term investments, and the restricted cash of 
257.1 million, and short-term debt of 140.6 million. 
Now move to our financial outlook for next quarter. 
For the first quarter of 2021, 
we expect the total revenues to be in the range of 1,050 million to 1,150 million, 
representing an increase of 20.6% to 32% year-over-year. 
The forecast reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and its operational conditions, which is subject to change. 
I think this concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. We are now happy to take your questions. Operator, please go ahead. Thank you. 
We will now being the question and answer session. 
If you wish to ask a question, please press * 1 on your telephone keypad and wait for your name to be announced. 
If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pound or hash key. 
Once again, if you wish to ask a question, you may press * 1 on your telephone keypad. 
Your first question comes from Dillon Heslin from ROTH Capital Partners. Please ask your question. 
Hi, good morning, good afternoon. I hope everyone's doing well. Um, thanks for taking my questions. 
Um, first, I know some of the other gig economy companies in China talked about some weakness in consumer demand 
from both the COVID variant of Delta 
and then some, some flooding and other macro impacts. 
Um, or, did you guys see anything similar in 3Q, um, and if so, has any of, have any of those trends normalized for 4Q? 
<silence> Uh, hi. This is Leslie. And, uh, even though the COVID-19 containment measures across the overall China, we 
can see we capture the business opportunity, and we have very strong growth. 
So, compared with our, uh, according to our growth, we consider that the, the market for on-demand delivery and for housekeeping and for mob, for mobility is still very strong. 
And we expect that the Q4, as indicated by Sandra in the, uh, uh, financial outlook, 
we're still expanding that there will be huge demand, and we will maintain this growth. 
Uh, although there will be, uh, like a spring festival followed up by, uh, Q4. 
So, we mainly focused on the profitability driven in Q4, 
but we expected that the demand for the service and for the revenue growth is still strong. Thank you. 
Thanks. 
Um, and secondly, uh, your gross margins were a little bit under pressure again in 3Q, um, down a bit more from 2Q versus what they were last year. 
How much of that is one-time in nature from some of the platform expenses you incurred to grow 
in terms of like, technology and hardware? And then what sort of like, a steady state forward gross margin outlook for 4Q and beyond? Um, 
I would, I would like to explain, uh, the reason why the gross profit is a little bit, little bit down in Q3. 
That 
is because, uh, uh, we, uh, we have recruited a lot of staff, 
um, preparing for this Q4 because, uh, we already expecting, 
uh, very strong growth compared with last year. And overall, it's about 80% growth compared with last year. 
So, for this coming winter, we need to prepare, uh, people in advance, because 
in this year particularly, in the market, the labor is, 
uh, more, um, the supply of the labors compared with the last few years is, uh, relatively limited. 
So, we have to get more people on board with us, 
uh, prepared for the Q4. 
And also, be- 
because, uh, uh, we are facing, uh, some extreme weather according to the forecast, uh, for this winter. So, we're prepared for our winter equipment, 
uh, a little, a 
little bit early. And, uh, it's a full preparement in Q3. 
Uh, that's the reason why, why we, 
and a little, a little cost has been increased in our operational cost, but it is one-off investment in the winter equipment and 
also in the labor recruitment cost. 
inaudible And, uh, uh, 
I can give you a rough, uh, picture of the first quarter, uh, prof, uh, gross profit margin. 
We expect the margin will be better than this quarter. Thank you. 
Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. 
Um, one more, if I may. Can you sort of talk a little bit more about the multi-city deployment? 
Um, what's your go-to-market strategy there? Like how do you select which, which city, I'm not, I'm sorry, not multi-city, multi-service, 
uh, which cities get the multi-service, and, and how do you, how do you onboard some of your workers onto that platform? 
Uh, for multiple jobs completed, and, uh, also we consider a multi-scenario deployment, 
actually, that we, this is a national-wide, uh, strategy. 
And we basically will provide, uh, for our workers for multi-job opportunities. 
But for these workers, possibly, and, uh, this does not have this kind of skill or capability, 
so we have online training system and the schedule, uh, equipped with inside purchase. 
So with these two systems, we'll help them to adapt them to the new job, uh, opportunities and help them to get the income, 
uh, more income. 
Uh, besides of that, I know we have, uh, called this, um, 
uh, foreign language. 
Screen system. Yeah. We have a screen system on Quhuo platform. 
This screen system will help to record and, uh, uh, this, uh, this personnel, and their qualification, and their skill set, 
and their work record in the system. 
And we use a kind of like, the algorithms to help us to identify and match the people to the right jobs. 
And when these people in the system being matched and we will encourage them and provide them with the training program, 
and, uh, some kind of encouragement, 
and they will be better, easier, and also be encouraged, uh, to work in the new job opportunities. 
That's how we can, uh, uh, 
keep, uh, the more workforce in our platform to, uh, have, uh, more job opportunities and increasing about 28% quarter-over-quarter. Yeah, thank you. Okay, thank you. That's it for me. 
There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.
