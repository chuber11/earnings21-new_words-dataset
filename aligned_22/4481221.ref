Thank you for joining us on this call. I will now operatorâ€¦ Now I hand over to the operator for purchase. Operator? 
Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. 
If you have any questions or comments, please press * 1 on your phone at this time. 
We ask that while posing your question, you please pick up your handset as listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. 
Please hold while we poll for questions. 
Your first question for today is coming from Greg Burns. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question. 
Good morning Greg Burns, uh, with SIDOTI & Company. Um, 
I just wanted to ask about the first about the Kotak investment. 
Um, what was the rationale behind, um, taking that investment in the, uh, the contact center business 
and you know, what benefits do you see from, from their involvement? Thank you. 
Select? Yeah foreign language. Yeah. Uh, thank you, 
Greg. 
Uh, Kotak is the ultimate investment fund, which is managed by one of the most established, uh, bankers in India 
where, uh, the fund has LPs, 
which include sovereign wealth funds, uh, which are among the best names who participate in data center investments across the globe. 
As you are aware, 
Sify has a very active, uh, business presence in the data center services, 
and we have been continuously investing and expanding our data center capacity, 
considering the highly increasing demand for data center colocation services. 
So this investment from Kotak is, uh, through a compulsorily convertible instrument, 
where it is meant for financing or rather park financing 
some of our green field data FinTech capacity expansion over the next three years. 
So that's the background of the investment and the investment, uh, house. 
Okay. 
Um, 
in, in terms of, um, I guess the, does it acce- accelerate your ability to invest? Has it given you greater flexibility? I'm just trying to understand, um, a little bit better, you know, what, what advantage has taken that, that outside capital has 
for you? Yeah, so, it actually, uh, does multiple things. One is it 
helps us, uh, fast track our data center capacity expansion 
as we tend to raise about, um, 1,000 cores, which in terms of INR million is 10,000 million 
amount of capital, which will be accessible to us for our expansion needs. 
Along with the debt financing, which we can raise from the banking system. Approximately with a debt equity ratio of 2: 1, it 
helps us to create substantial capacity over the next, uh, three years. 
And lastly, participation by an established banker and the sovereign wealth funds who are globally respected LPS 
also validate our data center business model and our competences in this business. 
So it places before, uh, capital for expansion and also gives us access to raise 
capital beyond what we have already contracted. Okay, great. Um, 
I guess and then, you, you mentioned also, 
um, committing to, uh, 9,900 million, uh, incremental investment in data centers. Is that, is that all part of this 
likeâ€¦ With, umâ€¦ Yeah. incremental capital you raised from Kotak, or is that, is that separate from that? Is that, is that incremental and new? Or how, how should we read into that? 
And what's the, the timeframe on kind of when you expect that investment to be made? 
Uh, the numbers, which are being communicated to the press release 
are for the existâ€¦ Are for the data center projects where there is currently work in progress. 
Those will be financed by internal accruals and debt from the banking system. 
What we are raising from Kotak special, 
Kotak fund is for new greenfield projects, 
for which, uh, the projects will be taken up effective from March of this calendar year. 
Okay, okay. Um, and then in terms of, um, I guess, your reclassified, um the way you report your, your segments, 
with, within digital services, could you just give us an idea of, um, the, the growth of the different pieces? Um, 
I'm assuming cloud and managed services was continuing to grow. But 
if you just give me a, a little breakdown of that 18% decline? 
Yeah. So as far as the Sify digital services are concerned, 
uh, as you rightly observed, the cloud and managed services continues to grow. 
Whereas the, in this particular quarter, our technology integration services, 
where we had a couple of large projects to be executed, 
those project's execution is work in progress. And given the pandemic associated supply chain issues, 
those projects will get, uh, completed, hopefully, in this calendar quarter, in this quarter four. 
So the cloud and managed services grown during the quarter. And the others, particularly the technology integration services, there's a de-growth. Okay. Um, 
I guess, since you brought it up in terms of the pandemic, a- 
w- whereâ€¦ I guess what's the status of the, the conditions in India like, are, are you, are you constrained by 
like, um, mandates or lockdowns anymore? Is, is business getting back, more back to normal there? And, 
you know, uh, uh, what's your view, I guess, 
looking forward in terms of maybe some of the constraints 
on the business in terms of the pandemic? 
Getting back to normal, 
normal, except that, uh, with this Omicron there are, uh, lockdown specified in a few states for the weekend. 
Otherwise, the business continued to work as them almost limping back to normal 
except that many organizations are still pursuing work from home as a model. 
From a business perspective, as far as the chairman observed in his opening remarks, 
the network and data center services demand continues to be high and growing. 
And on the digital transformation services, the customers are, uh, a having extensive conversations. 
And these conversations we expect to get converted into tangible, 
uh, orders and revenue conversion in the foreseeable, uh, future. 
Okay, great, thank you. Thank you.
