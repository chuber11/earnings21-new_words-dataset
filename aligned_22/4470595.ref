Mariano inaudible. 
Thank you Anna. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide four for our earning presentation. 
When we go to rebound inaudible this quarter, we continue to operate under challenging market conditions 
with high inflation, negative interest rate, and interest-free loans at historical lows and growing inflation. 
In addition, inaudible regulations inaudible 
reporting and attributing inaudible in 2021, 
compared to 348 in the prior quarter. 
It was inaudible by lower provisions reflecting a strong right here in collection policies along with a inaudibleeconomic activity. 
Somewhere inaudible expenses, also contributed to this performance 
when we continue to reside our inaudible and executing our inaudible challenge information strategies. Our 
comparative efficiency rating excluding inaudible severance payments on early retirement charges 
improved to 31% inaudible from 72% in the second quarter. 
inaudible by it's own revenue base. 
Looking at the first nine months of the year and excluding recurring charges, expenses were down nearly 7% year on year. 
We also maintain a solid cash inaudible with year one rating of 14.1% 
at quarter end and a inaudible current environment and implement inaudible strategic transformation. 
Patricia will provide, shortly, an update of our progress on our inaudible information agenda followed by a video which will present our key inaudible and inaudible. 
Now please turn to slide five. 
We expanded our inaudible by 5% inaudible in this level and recovering market share. 
New growth was mainly driven by higher mandatory credit inaudible which rose to inaudible accounting 
for over 30% of total loss this quarter from inaudible in the prior quarter. 
Short term finances corporate also contributed to low growth along with inaudible, personal loans which released the inaudible 
10% sequentially. 
Now, moving to funding on slide six. 
inaudible remained relatively stable quarter on quarter at 63% with liquidity at solid levels. 
inaudible sequentially through the inaudible funding from the management and corporation accounts. 
According to policy, we're stable quarter on quarter. 
inaudible were at 1.5% sequentially, accounting for plenty, over 11% of total deposits. 
Turning to slide seven, 
inaudible two percentage points to 17 from 19% in the second quarter. 
inaudible returns inaudible over management 
with main inaudible when inflation inaudible given that 
inaudible price index inaudible continued to attract pressure on it. 
Turning to inaudible quantity on slide eight. 
Our strong and inaudible collection policies together with improved economic conditions 
allowed us to release a portion of the COVID-19 specific provisions created last year. 
As a result, loan provisions declined to 1.4 billion from two billion in the prior quarter. 
In turn, customer net improved to 3.5% from 5.7% in the second quarter. 
At quarter end, COVID-19 and it's provisions amounted to 1.6 billion pesos versus 2.4 billion as of June 30. 
Our total provision in inaudible is 2.6% in September, about the previous level of 6.4% posted in February 2020. 
The total inaudible for the quarter increased 20 points sequentially to 5.5% inaudible in July. 
Sequential increase was mainly driven by consumer segments. 
inaudible we saw an increase in the inaudible of the great period 
with a consumer finance inaudible nearly 21% this quarter end. 
inaudible. 
To another extent, NDL also increased to 5.1% from 2.2% inaudible segment inaudible 
of customers performing 
with inaudible, but none performing with inaudible. 
By contrast, corporate is a means and bank credit card also is sequential and appropriate inaudible. Slide, 
uh, slide nine. 
Although payments remain suspended, you do inaudible that inaudible are the main drivers of our business for the remainder of the year and 2022. 
Starting with inaudible loans, 
we expect to see both inaudible in 2021 inaudible super loans and allow inflation in 2022. 
Both expect 20 year with deposit growing above inflation fostered by inaudible and to a lower extent by interest rates inaudible. 
We expect deposits to continue growing above inflation, driven by the same strength. 
With inaudible quality, participation, NPL'sinaudible quarter are expected to remain stable or decline in fourth quarter. 
We also expect coverage to decline as COVID-19 provisions are used or reversed. 
inaudible is expected to be below 2020 and 2019 levels, but in line with historical levels of 5-6 %. inaudible 
margin for the remainder of the year 
2022 inaudible higher cost of funds presented from the impact of the the prior 
interest rate inaudible for loss. 
This is upset by higher inflation inaudible demand and inaudible pick up from historical low. 
Personal and interest expenses are likely to grow with inflation. inaudible 
reflecting economic struggle in inaudible competition is from the execution of our inaudible and extension of 
the turnover tax inaudible and inaudible, we continue to negatively impact expenses. 
At the same time, inaudible is expected to grow in languid inflation. 
Finally, we continue to expect inaudible liquidity to remain at comfortable levels, supporting those inaudible. 
100% of our capital is inaudible inflation. 
Now, let me call inaudible who will provide an update for our strategic initiatives. Patricio, please go ahead. 
Thank you, Mariano. You heard Mariano present our financial results and views for the remainder of the year in 2022. 
In this challenging context, we remain fu-fully focused on advancing on our transformation strategy. 
Starting with the transformation of our branch channels, 
using best and fast technologies to facilitate inaudible banking and expand inaudible everywhere and anytime banking. 
First, digitized customers have increased consistently over the past two years and were up 76% since March last year. 
Second, keeping a strong focus on the customer experience, we recently deployed an upgraded version of the advanced mobile app, rated 4.4 on the place or, and 4.3 in the App store. 
Third, with a successful performance of our inaudible for individuals in the province of inaudible, we're starting to scale this high inaudible model to other regions and segments 
and expanding our footprint while 
offering a superior customer experience combining the strength of our face to face approach with the high efficiency of our virtual app. 
This also allow us to expand our footprint throughout national territory without inaudible. And 
fourth, the, in the past four months, 
we're modernizing an expanded services to inaudible and related segments in 11 branches that were previously, solely dedicated to senior citizens. 
And expect, we expect to convert four additional branches to multi-segment format, format, before year end. 
Now please turn to slide 11. 
At the same time, we have been introducing technology for the innovation of our senior citizen branches because inaudible banking for these customer segment, 
which was indeed advanced in terms of digital adoption. 
Let me share some examples of the success of these initiatives. 
To allow for extended banking hours and higher efficiencies, we enlarged our 24 hour lobbies, increasing the number of biometric cash dispensers located in these lobbies. 
As of September 27, disciplinary-dispensers in our 24 hour lobbies, 34 lobbies, accounted for 53% of total cash dispensers, up for around 24% before the pandemic and nearly 40% a year ago. 
As a result, the number of transactions at human tellers declined sharply to 2% of total transactions from 11% a year ago and 22% before the pandemic. 
We are also seeing continued adoption of our digital, digital app dedicated to senior citizens with 
90 days locked in customers through the app increasing over 144% when compared to first Q 2020. 
Please turn to slide 12. As you can see, we're also advancing on the right section of our branch network. 
The introduction of best in plastic technologies to extend service hours, facilitating self-service banking in some branches 
while converting others to full service home which is allowing us to enhance customer service and productivity. 
As a result, we closed one branch in second quarter and then closed another 16 
between the remainder of 2021, the next year, subject to essential bank authorization. 
inaudible allow us to lower inaudible by nearly 6% here in Europe. Please now turn to, to slide 13. 
Our IT infrastructure strategy includes creating an, an APR environment to accelerate service development 
and come to market and our customer journey. 
In the first nine months of the year, we added a total of 95 APIs and 
plan to add another 153 by the end of 2022. 
We are also advancing inaudible data driven enterprise while migrating technology to a hybrid multi-cloud to provide the inaudible to grow efficiently. 
By October 20, 
20% of our technology was already, already migrated to the cloud and we expect to reach 30% by year end. 
With 70% of our technology anticipated to be migrated to the cloud by the, the end of year 2024. 
Please now turn to page, page 14. 
We are also making pro-progress on, on the current, our growth strategy for inaudible. 
Next week, we are formally launching inaudible Mobile inaudible that will 
enable us to grow our-â€¦ of savings accounts that will enable us to grow our client base and attract low-costing, low-cost funding at this subsidiary. 
After a successful soft launch in last August, IUDU has already opened 230,000 accounts among current customers. 
IUDU clients also have access to a wide range of digital banking services, insurance and wellness offerings. 
And we will continue adding new features and services in the coming months. 
We also have made progress in our goal of diversifying revenue origination beyond Argentina by deploying wellbeing and health services under the B2C or B2B to C format in certain countries in Lat-Am, excluding Brazil. 
We are, in this sense, advancing with Grupo-assisted and Europe assistance, 
uh, to implement in second quarter 2022, B2C wellbeing and health services in Paraguay. 
The offering will consist of health, dentistry, pharmacy, medical emergency, and veterinary, ve- ve- veterinar- veterinary services. 
Services will be marketed through the IUDU Wellness marketplace, 
which will host a varie- variety of well, wellness services under one platform, offering customers a simple and convenient and seamless experience. 
Additional information on the progress of our digital KPIs and, and a more detailed description of all these initiatives and timeline 
can be found in the back of our earnings call presentation. 
In summary, we will, we, while we saw improved activity in the quarter, near-term profitability is expected to remain impacted 
by overall weak credit demand, pressure on 
NIMs, together with the cost and investments required to, to continue building our ecosystem and execute our transformation strategy. 
This strategy positions us to retain and enhance our customer relation, or our current customer relationships while attracting new digital clients and driving operational efficiencies in the longer term, when demand resumes. 
Now before opening the call to Q&A, let me turn the call to Atilio Dell'Oro, one of our Board members and responsible for, for leading our EC- ESG strategy, who will provide an update on, of our initiatives and ambitions on this front. 
Uh, Atilio, please go ahead. 
Thank you, Patricio. At Grupo Supervielle, we understand the need for more long-term and more sustainable view of shareholder value creation. 
Until not long ago, a more philanthropic vision prevailed in our corporate social responsibility model. 
As of 2019, 
CSR is integrated into the group's core business through a responsible management model, oriented towards sustainability. 
CSR is no longer a goal contribution per year to NGOs. 
It is a way of doing business. We believe that how, not just what, matters in the business value creation process. 
In this new phase, we have assumed a commitment to grow sustainably, protecting the environment and pursuing our business strategy in a socially responsible manner. 
We believe that enhanced disclosure of nonfinancial information such as environmental, social and governance-related factors satisfies 
the growing demand for an alignment of corporate's financial performance with the company's performance in nonfinancial factors. 
To develop our ESG strategy, we have defined our pillars and commitments shown on slide 15. 
In slide 16, we present our ESG recent and most relevant highlights. 
In terms of our environmental responsibility, we work to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment 
by implementing a responsible environmental management system. 
We have been measuring 
our carbon footprint since 2019, and we compensate our greenhouse emissions to protect forest ecosystems. 
Renewable energy represents 44% of total energy consumption in our buildings. 
In addition, we have implemented a plastic waste management program to eliminate single-use plastics, 
and we have reduced paper consumption by 46 com- percent compared with 2019. 
Note that 75% of the paper consumed internally is responsibly sourced paper to protect forest ecosystems. 
In connection with social responsibility, we focus on financial education, which is the gear shift of financial inclusion. 
More than 88,000 senior citizens clients attended 
digital literacy and financial education programs conducted in alliance with 21 universities in seven provinces and the City of Buenos Aires. 
95% of transactions are conducted through our digital and automated channels. 
Diversity is also a key aspect of our social responsibility. 
In 2021, we launched a comprehensive program to promote a diverse and inclusive work culture. 
We also work on more than 26 corporate 
financial programs, with focus on education, childhood, senior people and civic strengthening initiatives. 
With respect to our responsibility with good governance, we believe a robust corporate finance, 
uh, is, uh, is key for guaranteeing a sustainable business model over the long term. 
Ernst & Young recently conducted a risk regulatory assessment and verified 97% compliance with the inventory of obligations applicable to Grupo Supervielle. 
The area of compliance 
monitors the correction, prevention program and our whistleblower hotline allows employees, suppliers and clients 
to report any malpractice, unlawful or unethical behavior. 
We have defined quantifiable metrics for our sustainability initiatives. 
On slide 17, you will see the key and most prevalent ESG goals for 2024. 
In relation to our environmental responsibility, we have set the following goals. 
We will continue to measure our carbon footprint, setting a goal of 6% reduction 
and 50% carbon compensation to protect millenary forests. 
And on the other hand, a target of 45% of our total portfolio screened and analyzed 
through our environmental and social risk policy. 
With respect to our social responsibility, we have set the following goals. 
33% of women in senior executive positions by 2024 
and 120, 000 people attending our financial dedication programs. 
Finally, our responsibility with good governance goals include 
publishing fully integrated sustainability report by 2023, 
prepared according with the Global Reporting Initiative. And in addition, we aim to have 
100% of our strategic suppliers submitting a self-evaluation form, assessing compliance with our policies related to human rights, diversity and governance practice. 
Thank you, Atilio. 
At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you need to be connected to the Zoom platform. 
We will not be able to take your questions if you are connected from a home line. To ask a question by host, please press the Raise Your 
Hand button, and press it again to withdraw your questions. 
You cannot just send your questions in written form via the Q& A box. 
We would like you to limit your talk to one question and then followup after, uh, afterwards. 
One moment while we poll for questions. 
The first question, uh, comes from Ernesto, 
uh, Gabi- uh, 
Gabilondo at Bank of America. Please go ahead, Ernesto. Well, thank you, Ana. Uh, good morning, uh, Patricio, Mariano, Atilio. Uh, good morning, everyone. 
Uh, thank you for your presentation, uh, and for the opportunity. 
Uh, my, my first question is on, uh, the political outlook in Argentina. 
Um, after the midterm elections, uh, I would like to know, uh, which do you think are the key challenges ahead? 
Uh, and if you think there are, like, potential key dates, uh, that the, we should be following? 
So, that, that's my first question. 
Um, well, fi- first of all, um, there was a clear, 
uh, there was a, a clear win of, uh, of, uh, the opposition. And, um, what, uh, I believe that, uh, uh, 
I mean, the president has announced, uh, that in, in December, 
uh, this December, they will present a multiyear, 
uh, economic program, um, in order to, um, to have the, the approval of Congress. 
And, uh, what, uh, 
we, uh, expect, um, I mean we, we, we, we know that, uh, there is, uh, a deadline with the IMF. 
So, there 
is, there is a short timeframe, uh, for the government to negotiate this multiyear plan 
in order to, to, to make it, uh, to have more sustainable fiscal policies, 
FX, more, more realistic, uh, also FX, 
um, um, levels in order to, uh, enhance, uh, export-oriented industries and to strengthen the, the, the, the, the reserves of the Central Bank. 
Um, uh, I, uh, what is, uh, not yet, yet really clear is, uh, whether, um, um, there is a, a clear line, uh, in, in the government in order to, to, to, to make, uh, this, uh, let's say, a commitment for this, uh, uh, economic plan. We will see. This is a very, it, it's going to be an in, in, in, interesting period. 
Uh, but, uh, um, 
I think also the attitude, what is important is the attitude, yeah, of the IMF, whether they, they will, uh, let's say, 
uh, allow for, um, uh, sort of a, a mo- a model through, um, uh, economic policy until 2023 or they will be strict in the sense that they want to have, um, a lessening of, of expenditures, public expenditures and, 
and reduction of subsidies, and so on. 
So, so, this is, I think, the, the, what we are looking for. 
I don't know if, uh, you want to add something, Alejandro, on that? 
I think you, you've hit on most of the points, uh, Patricio. 
As you said, it's key to understand what the scope and the depth of the agreement with the IMF will be. And, uh, going back to Ernesto's question, as to date, 
I think that you should follow carefully these talks to be able to establish when an agreement is reached. Perfect. 
Thank you so much. Then, uh, just a second question on the FinTech, uh, competitive landscape. Uh, 
I will appreciate if you can share with us, uh, who you see as the main players. Uh, the one I have on top of my mind is Uala. 
Uh, and how do you think IUDU and your new digital initiatives are against the other FinTechs? 
Uh, okay. Um, uh, I, 
I think that, um, uh, the, 
I mean, Uala basically is, is focusing on, 
on, on, on providing solutions for people who don't have, uh, bank accounts and, 
uh, and, uh, they, they are giving, uh, a value proposition on that. 
Uh, and, um, but, uh, the, I mean, the main, the main problem is that, uh, they don't have deposits. 
Uh, now, this is the reason why now they, they are applying for, uh, a banking license. 
Uh, in order to, to, to reach scale in Argentina, uh, you need to have, uh, uh, a license to, to get deposits. And, 
uh, uh, you can see this, for instance, uh, if you look at the, the size of, uh, uh, the funds that were collected by the, the, the, by, by Mercado Pago in, uh, 
the, uh, relation to the, the, the fund industry is, is, um, is nearly irrelevant, 
and they've been working on, on this. 
Uh, so, this is an en- this is an extreme example that, uh, um, the tran- um, let's say, only, uh, working, uh, with a 
transactionality, um, as a FinTech player in Argentina is not, 
is, is, is 
not, um, uh, they don't, they are not able to, to, to reach, 
um, um, uh, they need to, to have, let's say, that is a bank, a bank license in order to, to become a player in Argentina because of the restrictions we have in Argentina. 
Um, uh, in the case of IUDU, uh, IUDU is, uh, is, is transforming itself from a consumer finance operation, 
uh, fully, uh, almost fully focused in, 
uh, in providing financial services credit card and personal loans to, uh, people, customers, um, uh, uh, who come to Chango- to the Walmart, uh, Changomas, um, Supermarket 
stores, uh, towards now, uh, uh, to a full digital service. 
And, uh, we, for, for our main goal now, now will be to attract deposits, retail deposits. 
And this will have a significant impact for us, 
uh, to, um, I, I believe, to, to lower our co- cost of funds and to have a more, much more sustainable business. 
And I hope, and I think it will impact a lot in, in, in the overall, uh, net, net income revenue of, uh, uh, on capital creation of Grupo Supervielle. 
I don't know if you want to add something on the FinTechs, uh, Alejandro? 
I think, I think you mentioned the key issue of funding and access to funding. Uh, 
I also think that IUDU has done a terrific job at, uh, enhancing customer experience and putting together a very superior product offering. 
And I think those two things, combined with the strength of, of the funding capability, will, will make a very strong, 
um, positioning in the market in the next quarters. 
Thank you, Patricio and Alejandro. Very helpful. Thank you, Ernesto. Uh, our next co- uh, question comes from Gabriel Nobrega at Citi. Hello. 
Good morning, Gabriel. Please go ahead. 
Sorry about that, um I was having some technical difficulties. 
So uh, thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. 
Um, my first question is actually on loan demand, if you could elaborate further, 
what's driving the higher demand which we are seeing? 
I know that you are saying in your press release that um it's due to the government programs, um focused on SME's, 
but I just wanted to understand if you think that we are at an inflection point where loan demand isn't going to start increasing? 
And then how are you going to be able to control your adverse selection in that scenario? And I'll ask the second question afterwards, thank you. 
Okay. We, in fact, I mean Gabriel it's real that we are in a very low point of loan demand, inaudible loan demand. 
We believe that it has maybe to do with the lack of business confidence and also consumer confidence. 
Um, so, um we need these signals to reignite the loan demand. Having said that, 
there are certain, um particular enterprises that are export 
oriented, and they continue to perform well in the economy, and they 
areâ€¦ I mean we continue to serve them with uh different kinds of credit, particularly pre-export financing. 
Um, 
also there are enterprises that take advantage of subsidized loans to take leasing lines, where we are very strong in leasing, in order to replace equipment. 
Um, but 
uhâ€¦ and for individuals I think it's the same problem 
uh, very lackâ€¦ lack of appetite for loan demand. 
Um, what we see eventually, and it's interesting, in car financing. 
Because people see, in Argentina today, cars to be a protection of value, 
so used car financing is driving someâ€¦ a certain number of loans uh at the bank level and also at inaudible. 
I don't know if you want to add on that, 
but 
I'm good. Oh, um, basically 
I would mention that what we've seen during most of the pandemic, until there was a turning point in which the economy started to pick up, 
was that the working capital of most jobs, of SME's and corporates, have been going down. 
So there is an effect of replenishing working capital as the economy picks up, and that's basically what we are supporting. 
In terms of the adverse reaction, which I believe is the second part of your question, 
we are focusing on first on our clients, and helping them 
take off and regain much of the economic activity. In many sectors we are seeing that the level of economic activity is back to pre pandemic levels, and in some sectors even beyond that. 
So the first focus is on clients that we know, in sectors which we operated on, and find a change that we work with. 
The other focus is really supporting a pick up in some 
export oriented sectors. For example, inaudible, which are really picking up, and are showing good progress too. 
So, we believe that there is significant room for growth from, as Patricio pointed out, very low credit inaudible levels. 
Uh in additionâ€¦ in order to control, let's say, credit risk also, 
a largeâ€¦ for instance if individuals, a substantial part of personal loans, 
are given to individuals that collect their salaries in the bank, 
it's around 70 percent of all 
personal financing isâ€¦ you know, with debiting their accounts at the bank. 
So, this also lowers, let's say, an adverse selection. 
And for enterprises or corporations, 
I also said in addition, in complement to what Alejandro mentioned, is that we 
continue to do a lot of cash flow, cash flow based financing. Which is 
by itself, you know, 
it's a way of controlling risk. 
Um, but inflection points, I think we need to wait. A truly inflection point, I think we will reach it in 2023, 
with a political change, in my opinion. 
All right, that's very clear, thank you. And I actually have a follow up from the previous question on the inaudible landscape. 
I understand you talked about Uala, 
and what I wanted to understand is that uh, you showed us that you have around 500,000 
digital customers. 
Um, but when you compare with Uala, they already issued more than 2 million prepaid cards. 
And so I wanted to understand here, um is there a strategy from you, to grow the members of clients, maybe try to monetize them faster? 
Or are you still aiming at adding clients in a faster manner in the coming quarters? 
You want to answer? Yeah yeah. You know, what one thing that you have to bear in mind when you look at these figures Gabriel is whether these operations are making money or not, 
and how long it will take to monetize all this customer acquisition. 
Um, what we've seen in financial services is that recruiting science is not enough 
to be able to have a sustainable strategy of this time. 
This is why we emphasize in our strategy, the ability of having the right funding, particularly in the Argentine environment, 
and secondly, trying to have a, uh a principal or integral relationship, 
crossing several parts. 
We approach this segment with this more comprehensive view, 
and we aim absolutely at having this relationship of you know several products, 
with the right funding, to be able to drive uh growth. 
We believe that the cost to income proportion will be much better, 
and that the leverage we can have on our capital over a deposit base that we will capture, will allow us to scale adequately with a very efficient 
model. All right, thank you so much. 
Thank you Gabriel. Our next question comes from Rodrigo Nesto from inaudible. 
Hello Rodrigo, go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. Um, 
I have a question regarding the income tax rate, if you could explain part of the reasons behind the high effective tax rate and what should we expect going forward, and then I have a follow 
up. Mari I know you can go on that. Yeah, I can comment on that. Uh, you know Rodrigo, for the income tax rate, 
we have too many sources that increase tax rate. 
You know, the statutory income tax rate is 35 
percent, but there are certain differences between the statutory income statement and then for tax return. 
The main differences arrive from the value of fixed assets acquired before 2018, 
that differences are permanent, 
so they create an increasing cost at the incomeâ€¦ for income tax 
purposes, you hire 
inaudible before income tax in our statutory uh income statement. 
But the second and probably more important 
uh has to do with inaudible and as we carry forward, 
which they are not, according to the income tax law, 
they are not taxes and they don't accrue any interest. 
So we have, as many as you do, we have 1.2 billion Pesos inâ€¦ you first have assets, and start 
those coming forward. And these are the use values over time with inflation. 
Uh, so that loss of value, as it relates to income tax, according to whatever is recognized in the income tax line item. 
So that increases the charge in the income tax line item, and creates, in turn, a higher effective tax rate. 
inaudible, a larger in but when brought in before income tax, slower, have we had as last year, 
a inaudible. 4 Billion Pesos, income tax 
would only increase effective tax rate maybe from 35 percent to 40 
percent, but probably before income tax it's lower, has a greater impact, and can turn in up to 100 percent eventually. 
Thank you. And then if I may have a more strategic question, maybe to Patricio. 
I would like to know, very briefly, what makes him more enthusiastic about the future of the industry, and what concerns him the most about today's Argentina ranking system. 
Well, uh I think that the financial industry is bearing, 
let's say the cost of theâ€¦ the economy, which is not in a clear groove. 
And uh, the umâ€¦ but of course what worries me is that uhâ€¦ let's say um, a main business 
which is providing loans to the private sector, 
um has diminished over the last three years, and you can see this in the loans to deposits ratio, which is a minimum 
at historical levels. 
And I think it reflects what is happening in the financial industry as a whole. 
There is lack of demand, and um also another aspect which also worries me is there is lack of savings. 
So, uhâ€¦ and the lack of savings it has also to do with the absolute lack of confidence in our currency. 
We have a, we have a confidence problem, we need to get clear signals for investment, 
clear signals with the regulation, clear signals for 
export industries, clear signals for having an equilibrium in a monetary, 
I mean in a monetary, uh policies, in order to have a currency that uh, I mean 
that basically, it gets to lower inflation. 
The part about enthusiastic. Pardon me? 
The first question was, 'What makes you enthusiastic? ' 
What makes me enthusiastic is, is basicallyâ€¦ 
I mean instinct has basicallyâ€¦ is related to, uh let's say, if um there is aâ€¦ what we have seen on the political side now, is I think a request of the society to have a more pro-market political economy, 
and uh I hope they will, I mean the government will hear these requests of the society to have a more pro-market stance. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Rodrigo. Our next question comes from Juan Ricarde inaudible. Good morning Juan, go ahead. 
Hi, good morning everyone, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions, 
one it's related to inaudible, and the second one related to the international expansion. 
So in terms of inaudible, you mentioned that 
you felt inaudible pressure to continue, even the low uh low demands and regulations. 
So my question there is, 
does this quarter reflect the full regulatory pressure, 
or can we expect inaudible to contâ€¦ to go down in the coming quarters? 
And related to that, how is the bank working to limit the inaudible pressure? 
And the second question, related to international expansion, 
can you help us understand the strategy for expanding outside Argentina? 
Are there any goals that you can share with us, 
and also can the bank, can the group freely capital outside the country with the current regulations? 
Okay, um, let's first answer about the inaudible. 
Mariano will help but quickly I would like to state that there is a pressure, there is a continue pressure of inaudible, 
and mainly to do with the punitive regulations of the central bank, 
but also it has a lot to do with the lack of demand of loans. 
When loans resumes, it will help us, definitely it can, to let in, to have better means. 
But do you want to, do you want to answer the first question on this 
Mariano? Sure Patricio. 
Hello Juan. 
Well, in effect, this quarter we are seeing the full impact of central bank regulations, and also an adverse 
inaudible environment. 
So we have a very negative interest rate, with inaudible interest rate, repo at 36.5, 
and that compares with an inflation of more than 50 percent last whole 
month, so uh, this leads also to a very low credit demand. 
In that environment, we have regulative flaws for deposits crosstalk 
normally lower, the interest rate you have to pay on deposit, so uh we make positive trends. 
Uh, so it's a very challenging environment, 
and we are seeing that there needs to be a pulling back of it in this order, whilst you can see 
we have a lower theme in the last five quarters, 
um so regarding the second part of your question, 
what we can do to sustain and increase inaudible in the future, uhâ€¦ mm, and increase that in, uh, in the future. 
Uh, we, we aim to, uh, to grow in the inaudible distance, uh inaudible 
for this inaudible in, in savings accounts and corporate, uh, savings accounts. 
Uh, we have to increase the, the average volume of corporate calent-â€¦ accounts. 
This quarter, uh, we are seeing that also, uh, in the front half of the, of the fourth quarter, 
so, so that is, uh, very important. 
Um, also then, uh, uh, we need to increase our, our loan portfolio as great 
reman-â€¦ demand inaudible. 
We've seen, uh, in the last quarter, particularly, uh, the virtue, uh, 
with the, uhâ€¦ uh, we saw a growth of 5%, real terms. 
Uh, so, so we gain a, you know, f-â€¦ a market share there. 
And it's still, uh, in the, in the inaudible program inaudible uh, loans, uh, that are mandatory, 
so itâ€¦ that will have, uh, still a, a, a very large inaudible incoming inaudible, but, 
uh, uh, it is still a long road w- w-â€¦ for which we'll replace, 
uh, several valuable instruments by, uh, loans to the private sector, and of course, we, we intend to, to bring the future. 
We expect 2022 to be a year where we'llâ€¦ we resume growth above inflation, uh, and that will lead us to, to increase inaudible. 
In terms of, uh, the international expansion, that's good. We want to pursue to an 
Argent-â€¦ um, Argentâ€¦ I mean, recreating revenues beyond Argentina. 
Um, uh, at inaudible, uh, which is basically, um, a platform to deliver, 
um, uh, health, health services and also servicesâ€¦ well-being services to, to individuals, 
we, we will, uh, we, we will start, uh, 
deploying, uhâ€¦ we reach agree- agreements, uh, with two companies, 
uh, um, Yorba Systems, and A- Asistir is an Argentine company, uh, that, uh, provides health services. 
And, um, Y- Yorba Systems is more geared to well-being services in, in the home of inaudible individual. 
So, with both companies, we've, we've reached an agreement to start deploying, in part 
inaudible, uh, in inaudible in sec- second quarter of, uh, of, uh, 2022. 
And, uh, basically, what they are doing is they areâ€¦ 
they will be fundingâ€¦ they will be providing, like, commercial f-â€¦ I mean, 
commercial funding, uh, um, uh, which, uh, uh, this, um, it's, it's, it's, it's basically, we need this funding in order to deploy, uh, uh, digital marketing in order to attract customers. 
Um, inâ€¦ and it's gonna be, like, like, um, our first, uh, uh inaudible in, in, in Latin America beyond Argentina. 
Um, from there on, we will, we willâ€¦ we plan to continue to, to inaudible other countries. 
Uh, it's, um, it's a business that, uhâ€¦ I mean, our goals areâ€¦ our goals in, in inaudible is, uh, in, in, in three years from now, to re-â€¦ to, to, uh, let's say, t- to have 200,000 customers 
in, um, in five countries. 
Um, so, uh, this, this will give us, 
um, um, uh, say, a, a million customers in, in inaudible countries to get, and, uh, and itâ€¦ 
this is definitely, 
uhâ€¦ just to give you an idea, in Argentina, with the same lines of businesses, we already have 320,000, 
320,000 customers that we developed providing these services, so we believe that we can reach that and, uh, and, and get to revenues beyond Argentina. 
Um, then, um, for inaudible Online, 
um inaudible Online is aâ€¦ is, um, aâ€¦ we, are working on a, on a, on a, on a business plan. 
Uh, we've already said that, uh, we, we request an authorization toâ€¦ in, uh, the Central Bank of Uruguay to, to pursue, 
um, um, um, originalâ€¦ to, to provide original, um, investment services for in Latin 
America, excluding Brazil, uh, forâ€¦ particularly for the, ehâ€¦ providing, um, services forâ€¦ investment services in the U.S. market. 
Um, and, uh, so we are working on, on the, on the technologyâ€¦ technological, um, platform to deliver this, uh, in aâ€¦ from Uruguay, from b- business license of Ur-â€¦ focalizing in Uruguay. 
Um, and in addition toâ€¦ in 
additio-â€¦ we, weâ€¦ in order to, to start ourâ€¦ the government will already have secured, 
um, um, uh, around, um, $5 million that are already in a, in a, in a, in a holding part of Argentina, 
so basically, um, uh, dividends that were based from, from, uh, inaudible Argentina, 
and they, they, they were basedâ€¦ and basically they 
are in a, in a, in a holding outside of Argentina. We, we will start growing this 
w- w-â€¦ this, um, capital. 
That's helpful. Thank you. 
Thank you, eh, Juan. Eh, our next questions come from Alejandra inaudible at the inaudible. Hello. Good morning, Alejandra. 
Hi, good morning, and thank you for the opportunity. Um, I have two questions if I may. Uh, the first one is related to the cost. 
I mean, I was positively surprised by, by the performance this quarter, 
and, and given, eh, that the outlook is challenging on inaudible side, I was wondering what to expect going forward, 
especially given the, the inaudible that you've, that you've been doing. 
Okay, um, do you, do you want to go on that, uh, Mariano, or do you prefer crosstalk. I can start, and then Mariano can correct. Um, hello, Alejandra. 
We see lots of opportunities for, eh, enhancing our efficiency. 
Uh inaudible have been triggered by the acceleration of digital and automated channels throughout our inaudible network. 
The others come from the digital transformation process we've been discussing over the last quarters, and all these inaudible to a 
a reduction in the total amount of head count we 
need to operate, eh, and a reduction in the total amount of inaudible. 
We also see opportunities on the revenue side 
because the digital capabilities are giving us an opportunity to expand our footprint without actually having to deploy a physical branch network, 
so this combination is, is helping as a blueprint, and we foresee this, uh, trend to continue throughout 2022. 
Okay, but, but in terms of, of, of a level of efficiency that we should be looking at for the next couple of quarters? 
Well, um, you know, we inaudible um, a inaudible increaseâ€¦ sorry, increase in, in head 
count, and I think that we will probably around that level moving forward. 
Okay. 
Okay crosstalk. Andâ€¦ yes, Ale- Alejandra, also to, um, to, uh, to, to complement what Alejandro said also, 
uh, as usual, 
uh inaudible is, is, is also in the middle of a huge transformation from a consumer finance company, 
uh, where business was done, uh, mainly in the traffic of, uh, of supermarkets, 
uh, and, uh, towards um, um, uh, a digital bankingâ€¦ full digital banking purpose. 
And that entails a change of the way we do business, e- even in the, um, in inaudible of supermarkets, 
uh, inâ€¦ the, the people that are in supermarket, we 
will, we will, we will foster a much more, um, let's say, 
um, uh, uhâ€¦ the, the way clients say the inaudible will be much more digital, and so this, in, inâ€¦ we will see in aâ€¦ 
in 2022, um, um, a substantial, uh, efficiency in terms of head count also at inaudible, 
eh, because of these transformations that we, we are working on. 
And, uh, so you will see this in, you know, overall inaudible, uh, 
we have, um, um, um, so- some, uh, significant reduction of head 
count in 2022. If I had to inaudible. 
Thank you. I- i- if I may, uh, follow, uh, uh, follow up on that, um, I mean, there's a huge demand for, for, for digital jobs, and, and, and digital native, uh, workers. 
How are you, how are you feeling, uh, the market there? How are you competing with the fintechs and also with, with the, 
the so-called inaudible labor with, with other companies from abroad coming and, and, and taking the opportunity to 
hire people, 
eh inaudible? 
All right. It's a very good question. Uh, 
Alejandro do you, do you want to, uh, to, to inaudible retention of talent, 
basically. Yeah, yeah, yeah, quite right, Alejandra. It's, it's becoming more and more challenging and, yes, we, 
we are competing with fintechs, with fintechs and also with international companies that are hiring Argentine talent, 
uh, for work abroad, 
so, so it is becoming challenging. 
What we can is, uh, basically, eh, first, eh, focus on the key areas where we're getting most efficient. 
This is basically digital inaudible, as you pointed out. 
We're working, uh, on finding proposition, 
and, uh, there were several aspects of the way that we work and the ability to, uh, uh, address the different needs that our, eh, workforce had under these challenging times. 
So, part of it has to do with adjusting the, the way we work at workplace. 
Second, as I mentioned before, the guiding proposition, adjusting it to market and keeping inaudible on these changes 
but also introducing other, um, different, uh, alternatives in the way in which we compensate and in the way that we motivate. 
Um, some of these, um, are, eh, basically, out of focu- focus groups that we do with, with the teams, 
um, and also require a greater involvement, uh, in the digital transformation of some of the seniors of the organization to have, uh, the new talents navigate. 
That, so, 
um, we think that this, this forum will actually in-â€¦ become greater over time because the transformation between inaudible is getting more and more, uh, visibility. 
So, we, we are getting prepared for it, 
and we are having, uh, so far, uh, good success in retaining some of the cases that, that, um, have been brought forward, 
but, but it is getting tougher going forward. 
Okay. Mm, thank you. 
May I do a third one? Yes, uhâ€¦ Short one. Eh, wha- what's the inaudible level that you've been comfortable in terms of coverage? 
Uh inaudible. Yes, I can, I can comment on that. 
Um, that you know, we work with the, the expected loss models according to, to ac-â€¦ 
inaudible. Um, so there's no, uh, li- li- like, a magic person just, like, to explain what kind of percent or inaudible. 
Uh, it will depend, uh, on, on the loan portfolio, 
uh, or on the inaudible of that portfolio, the, the outlook looking forward. 
You know, thatâ€¦ that's inaudible comprehensive inaudible loan, and that is the, the forward-looking, uh, part of, of the inaudible. 
Uh, so we are, we are comfortable with the level we have right now. 
Um, we, we think it's, it's adequate, uh, uh, with us. It was adequate to help, uh, larger corporates in the past, uh, where we had, 
uh, less inaudible, um, and, and also theâ€¦ there was a inaudible was in place. 
Uh, so even in inaudible I will expect to probably, uh, decrease coverage as, as we, as we feel f-â€¦ 
comfortable, um, um, uh, using that inaudible provisions that we created during last year. 
Uh inaudible we had, uh, 2.4, 2.4 billion, uh inaudible specific provisions. Now, they're increasing by 
inaudible, and that should, uh, decrease in the futures. Of, of course, always that, uh, 
situation ge- gets inaudible. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. And inaudible Alejandraâ€¦ I'mâ€¦ for your questions as well. We agreed to this question-answer session. 
Thank you for joining us today. Thank you, eh, for the interest in our company. We look forward to meeting more of you in the coming months 
and providing financial and business updates next quarter. 
In the meantime, we remain available to answer any questions that you might have. 
Thank you, and stay safe and healthy.
