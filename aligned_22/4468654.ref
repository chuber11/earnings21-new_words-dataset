Good afternoon. This is the classical conference operator. 
Welcome and thank you for joining the DiaSorin nine months, 2021 results conference call. 
As a reminder, all participants are listen-only mode. After the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. 
Should anyone need assistance during the conference call they may signal an operator by pressing star and zero on their telephone. 
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Carlo Rosa, CEO of DiaSorin. Please go ahead, sir. 
Thank you, operator. And good morning or good afternoon, uh, to all these, to the participants, to the 3rd 
quarter, 2021 inaudible results. As usual, I will make a few comments about the business, 
um, in more qualitative and then Mr. Pedron, the CFO of the company is gonna take all of us through the numbers. 
Now, uh, this is the first quarter where, uh, we also have Luminex included in our numbers. So, uh, in order for everybody really to understand how the business is trailing, I'm going to make my comment, 
uh, without 
Luminex at the beginning. And then I'm going to give some, uh, remarks on the Luminex performance. 
So, uh, if we look at the, the business at constant exchange rate and without Luminex, 
in quarter three, the growth was 10% versus, uh, Q3 of 2020. 
Um, if we look at the different technology, 
uh, CLIA ex-Vitamin D had an outstanding performance, plus 30%, and we're going to see 
that this is the result of a successful placement in all the different, uh, geographies, primarily US and Europe. 
And the program that today are driving the success of our CLIA business are the specialty and the stool program together with the, the TB deployment and the program that we're running together with QIAGEN 
to convert and grow the TB franchise around the world. 
Vitamin D, uh, is down 8.7% 
and this is clearly related to the Quest loss that happen in 2020, 
at the, at the end of 2019, and, and now is, is in full effect starting for from this quarter. 
As far as molecular is concerned, the business overall grew 5.5% 
versus last year, clearly the vast majority of the business, uh, is, uh, 
COVID related, and I'm going to make some comments about the COVID, uh, later on. 
Now if we deep dive into the geographies and we start from Europe. Uh, Europe grew actually 
20%, uh, year-over-year, uh, quarter-over-quarter, sorry. CLIA is including Vitamin D, so all in is up 18%. 
COVID molecular is up 30% versus, 
uh, quarter three in 2020, and this is, uh, due to the fact that, uh, as 
I think, uh, many other operators in this industry have already commented about the European, uh, 
COVID business has been, uh, uh, more f- flat and so less, uh, affected from volume, uh, increase or decrease over the last few quarters. 
Uh, we do have an install base of, of MDX systems, which today sits primarily in Italy, uh, in Spain, in, in, 
in France, and this is due to the fact that, uh, when we had to launch the system, uh, during the COVID pandemic, 
we clearly gave, uh to these geographies a preference over other geographies due to the limitation in number of systems that we could manufacture. Today that, the install base in Europe 
fits into, primarily into hospitals and it is used to triage, uh, uh, in patients. 
It is used on symptomatic and therefore today we are not at risk of losing 
some of the volume that typically was, 
was related to screening of a symptomatic that was happening in the high throughput platforms in the core labs. 
When it comes to, uh, US and Canada, 
uh, the business overall is flat, but I think we need to read, uh, uh, between the lines, uh, in terms of how technologies are performing. 
CLIA is up 36% versus quarter three, last year. 
Again, deployment of the hospital strategy with the, the TB product at, and the stool again and all the specialties that are really leading the charge 
is, is allowing us to penetrate this segment. 
If you remember at the end of 2019, we had invested $5 million in creating a, a dedicated sale force for this segment, and 
I think that today we are reaping the benefit of the fact that we do have a, a manual product 
that fit very well the space. 
Uh, the TB is certainly a product that is interesting in this space. Today, there is lots of send out in that space that due to the viability of datas on XL now, hospitals can bring in 
house and save money versus, uh, versus the se- send out opportunity. 
So overall the CLIA strategy is working very well in the US. It is becoming our primary geography around the world. 
When it comes to the molecular business in the US is flattish. 
It's decreasing, I believe, 1% versus Q3 last year. 
And this is due to the fact that there has been a softening of volumes clearly from the peak that the, the over- 
the industry enjoyed in Q1 
of 2021. 
I think what is noteworthy is that when it comes to the instrument sales, we are €7 
million down versus last year and this is explainable by the fact that all 
the emergency funding that was available in, in 2020, uh, to, to buy instruments and now it, it, it, it, it really dry down. 
And so today we are, we are, we are converting CLIA. 
We are not selling systems any lo- any longer. We are placing system under the inaudible rental business model, which is what, as you know, we've always been doing, 
uh, before the COVID pandem- 
pandemic and emergency funds became 
available, so overall the business is flat, but the CLIA is, clearly, it is very successful in the US. 
Now if we move to China, year-to-date is plus 28%, quarter three is plus 5%. So we see that 
in China there is a recovery compared to, uh, the, the debacle of 2020, although, I believe that, uh, there are a couple of things that are not working 
in the geography. 
First thing is that there is volatility in testing volumes and this has to do with the fact that, uh, in order to fight the pandemic, 
uh, there are continuous lockdowns in different provinces and cities, 
and every time there's a lockdown, certainly, their routine testing is suffering. 
The second effect that is not worth it that we start to see, as everybody else, 
price affected due to the fact that these provincial tender are entering into effect. 
There has been a report which has been issued 
a couple of days ago by one of the primary research firms in the US. 
It was actually saying something interesting about the standards, DiaSorin has been one of the companies that has been on the winning side, 
so we won 
a certain number of provincial tenders. O- o- uh, although it is very clear that the pricing structure 
for some of the routine assays, like the thyroid and oncology products that today are really suffering, 
uh, the, uh, competition from local manufacturer, the price structure certainly is very different from what we used to enjoy when we were going to each hospital offering our products. So 
I believe that as far as China is concerned and, uh, as, uh, other, uh, manufacturers, uh, have expressed in the last few days, 
I believe that the future, uh, for China is quite, um, uh, uncertain and, and quite difficult really to predict what is going to happen in the next few qua- 
few quarters in this geography. 
So 
I believe that from an overall geographical perspective, though today the US do represent 50% of the DiaSorin business, 
and strategically, if you remember, when we were commenting about the Luminex acquisition, 
one of the reason why we want, we bought Luminex is, is because we strongly believe that the, the market today guarantees, um, growth, good pricing and very inaudible for innovation in the US 
and DiaSorin is very well position to, uh, enjoy these opportunity, again, through the Luminex acquisition. 
Now, uh, i- uh, I'm going to talk about COVID a little bit. The elephant, the elephant in the room. 
So today COVID, including Luminex, and again sorry for, for, for, for changing the perimeter, but 
I think this is important. COVID for DiaSorin does represent today 30% of the overall business. 
Year-to-date the business has been growing nicely, around 55%, 57%. Uh, when it comes to the 
last 
quarter, it's, uh, plus 5%, certainly with different dynamics about, uh, between the US and Canada and Europe, which I've been discussing before. 
It is quite difficult to predict, in my opinion, what is gonna be, happen to COVID, 
as I think, again, other operators have been commenting in their, in their quarterly results, 
and so, 
uh, but today, uh, again, when it comes to Europe, we see a steady demand, and when it comes to the US, 
we certainly see a decrease in testing volume compared to peak of around 30%, 
but the demand is, uh, at this point relatively flat, uh, in the last two to three months. 
Okay, so we now need to really wait and see what is going to happen 
during the, uh, uh, upcoming flu, flu season or, uh, respiratory season. 
Uh, today, uh, 
I always provided you with, uh, also volume testing, volume in terms of manufacturing. Today is 
a combination of DiaSorin and Luminex. 
We are shipping roughly 1 million tests a month 
of, of COVID, of COVID products. 
Um, then, uh, I'm gonna make a comment about Luminex. Uh, as you know, 
uh, we have incorporated now Luminex, uh, for the full quarter and roughly €19 million of revenues in the, in the quarter. 
Uh, the acquisition, uh, has been completed in July. Since then, 
uh, we have started to work with the Luminex management on the integration. 
Uh, we 
have recently announced the new organization 
where we do have, uh, uh, now a management team that, uh, is a combination of DiaSorin and Luminex managers that will have the responsibility to lead, um, the company forward. 
We are completing the integration plan, uh, that will be presented to the board of directors in December 
and it is going to be disclosed as part of the December seve- 17, investor 
day, when in broad terms, we're gonna talk about what we intend to do with Luminex, and how we intend to leverage all the 
assets that actually Luminex has brought to DiaSorin. 
I make one more comment about the inaudible Two platform that, as you know, is one of the key platforms or key technologies that, 
we acquired it through this acquisition. 
We, uh, intended, we are planning, uh, to have a soft launch of the inaudible Two in 2022, ex-US. 
So in Europe, and then we're going to have all the submissions, 
um, in the US where we expect to launch the platform in 2023. 
The platform is gonna be renamed, 
so the inaudible Two name is gonna be soon abandoned and it's going to be substituted by the new name, which is Liaison Plex, and 
this is become there because, uh, this platform does complete 
the product portfolio of DiaSorin, that I remind you, is gonna be made of the MDX Plus, 
which will, will be the platform that can, can offer small plexes, the Liaison Plex, 
which will be the one that will allow us to develop high complex panels. 
And the Liaison Nes that will be the one that we, uh, are going to use, uh, for the 
decentralization of molecular testing, alongside the ARIES platform, which is the legacy, uh, from, uh, a Luminex legacy platform, from Lum- 
from Luminex that today is, has been successfully launched in Europe, in, uh, sorry, in the, primarily in the US with an install base of roughly 70 systems today placed 
in some European countries. 
One thing that is, uh, worth noting is the fact that, uh, when we look at the, the, the customer base in 
the US, uh, um, what is very interesting is that Luminex is primarily o- offering its products, I'm talking about the inaudible products, to the hospital market. 
There are over 700 hospitals that, uh, the, uh, company is, uh, is, is selling to in the US 
and, uh, uh, DiaSorin has roughly 250 hospitals that we are, uh, uh, serving and supporting, 
and the interesting part is that, uh, only 70 hospitals in the US are overlapping, 
and so we believe that, uh, there is, uh, a very interesting opportunity for cross selling products in this hospital base. 
You know that DiaSorin made of the hospital segment one of its primary target to develop the US, uh, market. 
The reason why 
the there, there is, there, there is no overlap between the two companies is because DiaSorin did develop its installed base 
using inaudible on XL, is on XL certainly requires, 
um, certain testing volumes in immunoassay and the hospitals that, uh, typically were running, uh, this volume were large, uh, institutions in the US, 
whereas as far as Luminex is concerned, 
they've been serving this market really starting from a mid-low throughput system, which is the, the inaudible platform. The inaudible One platform and the inaudible, 
and therefore they traditionally have developed their business in the mid, uh, 
segment, midsize segment, uh, uh, in the US. And, and in this provides a phenomenal opportunity, in my opinion, uh, inaudible on access. 
As you know, we are waiting for the approval of the TB assay on the, on the access we already have, all the, 
um, the other, uh, products, the stool products and the TT team already ready to go, 
and as soon as, uh, TB is going to be migrated there, and we expect to, uh, hear something from the FDA by year end. 
Then we are ready. We have an available, uh, uh, market of, 
uh, uh, over, almost 700, uh, institutions that we can go and sell the access to, so I'm very excited 
about this cross selling, uh, opportunity that the Luminex acquisition, uh, has provided to us. 
Now, uh, I think now I'm gonna turn the microphone to, uh, to Piergiorgio and he's going to take you through the financials. And then we're gonna open up, uh, the session, the Q&A session. Thank you. 
Thank you Carlo, and good morning. Good afternoon everybody. 
In the next few minutes, as usual, I'm going to walk you through the financial performance of DiaSorin in the first nine months of 2021. And 
I will also make some remarks on the contribution of the third quarter and on the impact of the Luminex business, 
whose acquisition has been completed on July the 14th. 
Again, please note that we are consolidating the full quarter of Luminex into Diasorin financials. 
So, said that, I'd like to start with what I believe are the main highlights of this period. 
On July the 14th, we closed the Luminex transaction for a total equity value of $1.8 billion, and starting from Q3, ' 21, 
Luminex financials are consolidated into DiaSorin ones. 
Please let me remind you that the acquisition has been financed by a mix of a bank term 
loan for 1 billion USD, five year tenure and a zero interest convertible bond for 500 million euro, with 22- Third convertible bond for 700 million Euro with 2028 maturity. 
The revenue that is reported so at current exchange rate and with the continuation of about 91 million Euro to Luminex business, due by 41% here today and 51% in the quarter. 
The goal at constant exchange rate and it's corporate consolidation in the nine months, is 29% and 10% in the quarter. 
These numbers as we would see, uh, in line with higher range of the guidance we provided in July. 
Q3, 21, growth margin at 65% is below last year, which closed at 68%, 
because of the expected delusion of the Luminex business. 
The year to date margin at 68% is substantially in line with 2020. 
Likewise, Luminex consolidation is that it rooted the effect on Q3 adjusted return margin, 
which closed the quarter at 41% versus the 46% of 2020. 
Once again, this is in line with our expectations and the guidance we provided back in July. 
Lastly, we keep confirming our ability to generate a very healthy free cash flow. 
224 million Euro in the first nine months of the year, with an increase compared to 2020 of 71 million Euro, 46%. 
The net financial position is negative for one point of five billion Euro, with 330 million Euro cash position… Positive cash position. 
Let's now go up to the main items of the P and L. So, September year to date the revenue's at 859 
million Euros, grew by 41% of 249 million Euros compared to 2020. 
Three drivers behind this balance. The sales inaudible Covid and Luminex then grew by 65 million Euro, 15%, 17 at constant exchange rate. 
Then we have the contribution of Covid sales, which grew by 93 million, 56%. 
Developed a confe- constant exchange rate of 60%. 
Luminex, which is a difference in co- consolidation which accounted for 91 million Euro. 
September year to date, growth margin it's 518 million Euro, which grew by 38% compared to last year. 
Closing the first nine months of 2021 with a ratio of a revenue substantially in line with 2020. 
As said in the beginning of my remarks, the difference with the previous year is mandatory then by the inclusion of the Luminex business in the scope of consolidation. 
This is even more clear, when we consider gross margin ratio of the quarter which closed at 65% compared to 68% of 2020. 
Let me please remind you that this variance again is in line with our expectation and the guidance provided. 
September operating expenses at 243 million Euro, grew by 24% compared to 2020. 
Variation of the revenue of 28% versus the 32% of the previous year. 
The 
increase in the inaudible of the third quarter from 28% of last year, to 31% of 2021, is due to the very same reason I write for the gross margin, the consolidation of Luminex into the DiaSorin members. 
Once again let me remind you that- that this is in line with what we forecasted 
and we are expecting this ratio to diminish as the integration of offsets will move forward. 
And we will deliver the synergy's discast during the call… We had that when we announced the Luminex theory. 
Year to date other operating expenses, at 23 million Euro, increased by 12 million Euro compared to last year. 
This variance is almost entirely driven by the one off expenses related to acquisition, which accounted for about 16 million Euro. 
As a result of- 
of what Jeff said, that September inaudible 314 million Euro, 37% of revenues, 
has increased compared to 2020 by 47% or 101 million Euro. 
Interest expense, at 14 million Euro, are almost completely driven by the bank, term loan and the convertible bond that was supported the Luminex acquisition. 
Let me 
please 
remind you that this number includes about 3.5 million Euro, none monetary interest, driven by the convertible bond. This just due by, uh, how the ISRS is dictating the way to account for interest 
on convertible bond. Even though, let me remind you that the convertible bond wou- wou- what it should have b… Zero monetary interest rate. 
The tax rate at 24% is substantially in line with 2020 which grow at 23%. 
And this brings us to the materials. Year to date materials, at 229 million Euro, or 27% of revenues. 
Which is higher than previous year by 67 million Euro or 41%. 
Actually, 2021 adjusted inaudible at 383 million Euro, 45% of revenues, 
is higher than 2020 by almost 50% of 125 million Euro. 
The variance at constant exchange rate is positive by 51% with a ratio of the revenues of 45%. 
The adjusted inaudible this quarter is 41% 
and is lower than 2020 which close at 46% 
because of what we said before, the, uh, growth factor of the, uh, uh, consolidation of the Luminex Pfizer. 
And as I said before, for the inaudible let me remind you that this is in line with our expectations. I want to make this very clear, 
and it's coming uh, uh, from uh, the lower operating leverage in the Luminex business. 
Uh, uh, let me now please move to the free cashflow as usual, in the first nine months of the year, 
the group generated 224 million Euro free cash flow, versus the 153 million Euro of 2020. 
With an increase of 46% of 71 million Euro. 
As discussed 2nd July, I believe it is worth underlining that uh, in 2021, we have had a much higher tax cash out, compared to 2020, 
78 million Euro, versus the 23 million Euro. 
The difference has been driven mainly by two elements. 
The difference phasing accounting for about 15 million Euro, and about 35 million Euro driven by the higher profit compared to the previous year. 
Lastly, let me please, uh, move to the 2021 guidance. As usual it's previous constant exchange rate. 
So, I'll highlight the performance of the third quarter, and uh, what we expect for the remainder of the year, the guidance for 2021, has been increased compared to July. 
In order to make the numbers comparable with 2020, we'll also provide as we did in July, a breakdown of the revenues between DiaSorin and the Luminex business. 
So the new guidance is calling for a total combined revenues that increase at around 40% 
and the total combined adjusted inaudible margin at around 43%. 
Besides 
the solid 
revenues forecasted between inaudible constant perimeter of consolidation and exchange rate by around 18%. For concluding, please remember that uh, DiaSorin financials are exposed to the US Dollar as we always remind everybody. 
And even more so now, that the United States represent about 50% of the total group sales. 
Uh, uh, therefore, as I will inaudible but for your modeling, consider that for every one cent movement of the Dollar against the Euro, 
DiaSorin revenues move by about 6 million Euro on a yearly basis. 
Uh, now let me please turn the on the light to the operator to open up the Q and A session. Thank you. 
Thank you, this is the COSCO conference operation. We will now begin the question and answer session. 
Anyone who wishes to ask a question, may press the star and one on their attached on telephone. 
To remove yourself from the questions, you please press star and two. 
Please pick up the receiver when asking questions. Anyone who has a question may press star and one at this time. 
The first question is from Alexander Berglund with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Thanks for taking my question, actually it's- it's two. Um, I'll- I'll start, 
um, I've wanted to get used to on- on this… kind of recent views on- on the Covid pill, and how you think that might, um, affect testing um, for- for- for Covid, if at all. Um, 
I mean, I always assume you need to have a positive Covid test before taking any pill, but, 
I was wanting to check if you… if you think that, kind of maybe on the margin, it could actually increase, you know, some testing as- as people get less cautious 
and… or- or if pe- people that are kind of been more resistant to the vacc- vaccine might- might con- consider not taking a booster shot. 
Um, so- so that was my first question, and uh, I'll let you answer it now, I'll follow up with another one. 
Uh, yes, I'll take the question, 
look, you know, the day they announced the- the pill, I think the whole industry lost, uh, over 5%. 
Um, the company that is making the MRNA uh, for the vaccine lost 19% that day. 
So I see that as being a lot of- of a- of a reaction. 
When it comes to uh, testing, as you said, rightfully so, you don't get… This is not an aspirin, so you're going to get it under medical advice. 
And you're going to get it once uh, there is uh, confirmation that, uh, you have… you- you have contracted co- Covid. 
To be honest with you, I don't think that when it comes to volumes, uh, uh, inaudible volume, uh, this is going to have a positive or a negative effect, more then 
I believe the fact that, uh, the uh, vaccination and uh, the fact that now the boost is going to be made available. Certainly is going to affect testing volume, um, I believe next year. 
Especially when it comes to the asymptomatic, uh, 
testing, right? Because, let's not forget that a lot of uh, testing, and testing volume came from asymptomatic testing. 
There is uh, testing that will remain, it has to do with the fact that everybody admitted to the hospital is going to get tested. 
You're going to have professional, uh, testing and you're going to have a air-line testing. 
But believe me, uh, Im not losing sleep, uh, on the effect that- that, uh, the- the pill is going to have on- on the business, right, in the Covid business. As said, it's going to be affected by other factors. 
Thank- thanks for that. And- and I inaudible kind of moving on to- to kind of the base business. Um, 
I mean, I- I had couple of feedback in today that uh, you know, some people were kind of expecting a bit more kind of all the recovery of the base business, especially kind of you… 
If you can look at it compared to- to 2019, so looking at none Covid. Um, you know, I- 
I was just going to get kind of your view or something, you kind of mentioned that a lit- a little bit ab- of what's been going on 
about if… You know, how are your kind of expectations of none Covid business recovery and how are you kind of inaudible are you seeing kind of, any- kind of in- 
reflection points in- in the trends uh, given now that we are already quite- quite far into… in the fourth quarter. 
If there's anything you can comment- comment on that, how- how- how it's doing right now. 
Uh, you are uh, referring to 2019. 
Uh, look, uh, com- uh, if you compare uh, 2021 to 2019, uh, I think there are two elements that- 
that uh, make the comparison. The overall business comparison uh, difficult. The first one I said, uh, uh, we are missing 
a very large vitamin D contract. 
That, uh, now the effect is going to be felt throughout uh, 2021. 
And uh, and then it's going- it's going to go away, clearly. 
The second effect though that uh, everybody is forgetting is the fact that uh, in 2019, uh, we had FD still. 
Uh, uh, on a inaudible business that was- was coming from, uh, Siemens. 
Uh, in 2- 2- 2019 it was uh, uh the year when we uh, we are- we are uh, still shipping uh, the inaudible that we did not convert it to inaudible and 
uh, all that business, uh, uh, pretty much have operated in- in 2021. 
So this is why I keep saying, if- if you really look at uh, the… You- you need to look at the be- the components of the business, which has to do with the clear and clear inaudible 
you need to look at vitamin D, and you need vitamin D element as they said, Manu said, 8.7%. 
There is a negative affect of course, and a positive effect inaudible the fact that some of it, um, post a impact of Covid and Covid testing for vitamin D on- on- on- on patients. 
Uh, and then clearly you have all the molecular part which has to do with, um, uh, with uh, with Covid. So, uh, 
I don't understand why y- you are not… You don't see the growth of the base business, because uh, uh, to me it is 
exactly the opposite, when it comes to the excel of 404 replacements year to date, so again, it's going to be uh, we're going to be placing, uh, over 550 systems, 
considering a slow down of China, 
uh, which is telling you that placements are not slowing down in the other geographies they actually… They are picking up. 
Uh, the um, the clear business, and again, and the success of uh, some of the programs we are conducting together 
with, um, some of the partners, uh, like inaudible or inter inaudible develop products, uh, is uh, growing very, very nicely. 
And on top of it, uh, when it comes to the base business, uh, we are weeks away from the launching the inaudible SA, 
you know? Uh, we are the- the only company that uh, will be able to carry that product on, um, 
on the platform. 
And uh, very excited about that. Last but not least, uh, is a big comment on inaudible uh, we 
have 700 hospital in the U.S. that today are… They are showing customers. And uh, we are on the verge of launching inaudible in the U.S. with TB and the rest of the menu. So, I- 
I'm very excited uh, to be honest with you about the base business. 
Thank you very much, appreciate it. 
Carlo, if you can just add a comment for the benefit of Adex, 
you know, usually we've always looked at the clearX vitamin D, and inaudible Covid as a inaudible of how the- the business is growing. 
And uh, I believe I didn't mention it in my remarks. But if I look at Q3 data, 
clearX, vitamin D, and inaudible Covid over 2019, is growing by almost 20% 
at constant exchange rate, 19% to be precise. 
So uh, this just to confirm all of your comments uh, on the uh, growth of the… uh, of the base business. Thank you. 
The next question is from Hugo Seville with inaudible please go ahead. 
Hi guys, uh, thanks for taking my question. I have one on, uh, Verigene two, uh, Carlo you mentioned, uh, in the call, that 2023 U.S launch. 
Uh, can you maybe give us a bit more detail on the exact timely- timeline and inaudible for this launch. Should we assume that, throughout Europe, you 
will have a soft launch period in the U.S, uh, during which will probably upgrade the distinct customers. 
So, just wondering, uh, when we should expect, uh, sales to kick in from the U.S. from the Verigene two. 
And what menu would you expect to have uh, by 2023 in the Euro- in the U.S and in Europe. 
Um, and uh, one question on China, um, China is uh, up 5% 
uh, can you maybe remind us here uh, what, uh, being a inaudible or should we expect the recovery. 
And uh, one last on margin, uh, you inaudible Luminex on the top line, but can you maybe help us understand 
what are the moving parts on the- on the- on the- on the EBDA 
uh, margin and what would have been the margin excluding Luminex. Thank you. 
Okay, in terms of colors, on the Verigene two, of the inaudible launch. Uh, 
I think uh, you will need to wait, uh, until the December 17 investor day, because we… I believe we are going to be more specific about this. 
What I'm… 
Today, uh, there are uh, uh, five panels that are in development, the respiratory in- included, uh, uh, clearly which has been extended with… to the Covid product. 
Um, you have the blood culture 
<cough> three panels. 
You, uh, the GI panel and then uh, you have the CNS panel 
that uh, is the one that uh, inaudible where the Luminex company development uh, um, later than the other. 
The uh, the- the bad news about the Verigene two, is that the company intended to start launching uh, the product starting from the end of this year. 
But due to the fact that uh, the um, um, manufacturability That uh, the um manufacture ability of the cartridge and instrument is not where it should be in terms of being able to 
uh uh uh face demand that we foresee for the system and we decided that we are to uh make an investment 
into bringing up all the lines that today are sitting in Chicago not validated moving away um 
from 
manual manufacturing into the manufacturing mandate is validated and the final line and this certainly uh is generating delays with the with the launch but we also believe by the same token, it is guaranteeing a more robust uh uh product. 
As far as the good news is concerned is that Pro development has continued 
uh in parallel and now rather than launching the system with just one panel 
we plan to uh have the completion of the menu happening very rapidly after launch. 
Certainly this is the benefit of the delay in the in the cartridge and system inaudible from an industrial point of view. 
But again, in terms of positioning, in terms of expectation I think you need to wait a few weeks 
until we unveil everything at 
the investor day. 
As far as channel is concerned plus 5%, 
look I I um, I said there are two, there are 
three things that are happening today and they are not happening today, sorry 
I think, I already, I heard few calls from other companies and everybody is pointing with the same direction 
and is priced and is a protectionism of the government visa vis 
the local suppliers when it comes with price we already did comment on that, 
there is an effect of of provincial tenders which is really a reset in the base for some of the two products. 
When it comes to uh the protectionism of the Chinese government 
uh well you can read the Financial Time but uh is very clear that today there 
is a preference of the Chinese government to the Chinese supplier so when possible there has been an acceleration 
of a strategy that uh if you remember was set in place 
uh 
uh with a target date of 2030 of having 50% of the medical supplies made in China. I believe that uh there is today um uh a desire and an ambition to actually make this happen much faster than we thought 
and as far as we are concerned and as far as how this is going to affect the business, look I think short term I think there is gonna be an affect of the business 
um uh Chinese business because uh there is a really nothing you can do if a provincial tender is asking you to be a Chinese manufacturer and you are 
not and so uh you are excluded from the tender, by the same token 
I believe that we initiated as you know over a year ago the construction of a manufacturing site in Shanghai which is proceeding 
and I believe that what this is teaching to all of us is that you cannot be half pregnant in China so you have to be uh 
perceived as a Chinese local supplier with uh products that are also directed to the Chinese martket which in some cases is are different from what we offer 
in the US and in europe. So fundamentally I believe that uh we are at a crossroads today where either 
you decide that uh you develop a Chinese brand with Chinese products or your gonna be strategically excluded 
uh from uh from that market. 
And so the discussion we are having internally is that uh we really need to 
uh develop now a strategy because behind what we what we had in mind in developing Chinese set of products and and and Chinese manufactured products 
just dedicated to the Chinese market. 
I I believe Karl, there was a question on margins and so 
I I will take it for Luminex so we are not gonna be disclose uh a detailed margin for the Luminex piece going forward 
but if you just some reverse engineering 
uh on uh Q3 numbers 
uh comparing to Q3 2020 
what you would see is that Luminex growth margin for the quarter is eh around let 
me 
say 55 60 percent compared to DiaSorin usual margin which was 68 69 percent and if you go down to the beta level for the quarter and you do a similar uh reverse math 
you would get two number which is around 25 percent. 
Again, this is quarter one uh this is uh without including uh uh uh um all the synergies which we discussed 
about and which we will come from the instagation process of the two companies 
uh uh one last comment, this is uh a touch better than what we modeled and an what we used for our guidance so I believe uh you know we are 
absolutely comfortable with the numbers we are seeing. 
Okay thank you very much, and just a quick follow up on on the synergies given that uh the inaudible two launches is now expected weeks more far out in 2022 and 2023, 
should we expect the the impact from the synergy to kick in a bit later than you usually thought? Thank you. 
I believe you know uh George Yes, yes I will take it Karl. I believe we would again, 
we will be more detailed and we will give more information during the capital market 
day which is gonna happen one month from now uh but when we build inaudible in terms of sy synergies we gave a number which uh if I 
will remember was 55 million dollars on the cost side. 
We didn't put any any kind of uh uh uh we didn't share any kind of number in terms of uh revenues on the top line, so 
I don't believe that you know any in discussion we are having on merging two is gonna affect our synergies on on the integration process side, 
quite the opposite in terms of revenue side. I believe Karl commented pretty well about you know the um good opportunities we see from this 700 or so 
uh hospitals to which we can go and offer our excess with uh the eh our menu 
eh which was not included in our modeling and nor in the synergies we gave. 
So you know I I still I, I don't think that this comment on on inaudible is gonna have any effect on uh how we see business going forward. 
Okay thank you very much. 
The next question is from Maya Pataki with Keplar please go ahead. Yes good evening. Three questions from my side please if I may. Um, 
Carlo, you are you know you're moving up 
uh the revenue guidance uprend of were where we were in uh in H1 and yet you know when I when I listen to your comments about COVID testing and volumes 
um, it doesn't really sound 
like you changed your view very much so I'm trying to understand what is the reason that you expect now to come in at the uprend of the guidance, if you could just share some thoughts on that. 
The second question is as usual about the point of care rollout that you're doing in the in Italy, can you give us some feedback on how it's going, what is the feedback, what is the demand that you're seeing, 
um for that product and then I'll follow up with the third one. Um 
I'm gonna make a qualitative comment and then uh PJ uh can actually add to this 
um so is not uh I believe that when uh let me say the visibility that we have today uh with COVID uh versus what we had when we actually gave a guidance 
is really is allowing us to be more precise 
and uh I think it's fair to say that 
um compared to Gloomis and inaudible could have been possible and some uh uh anticipated visa vis COVID in this flu season. 
I believe that quarter 3 was higher than um everybody, everybody in the industry was anticipating uh 
I believe Maya that 
um the big question mark uh still is in Q4 but not necessarily whether Q4 is gonna be lower than Q3, 
the question is whether Q4 is gonna be higher than Q3 or not 
and the impact of the um of uh the differential diagnoses visa vis the respiratory season 
right, so everybody coughing from now on with some fever uh will have to go through uh some sort of uh differential diagnoses and the question is 
in those countries like the US where there is an extended uh I think availability of over the counter testing I believe that, that volume is going to be captured primarily 
by the over the counter uh test in other in other geographies where the over the counter like in Europe did not really pick up 
because not sponsored by the government 
um your gonna have an increase in testing volume because it's gonna be done 
in laboratories where all all the traditional operatives operators are operating, 
so this explains in my opinion the now the comfort that we have on the apparent of the guidance, but PJ do you wanna add more? 
No Karlo that that's exactly right, I mean eh the eh the rise in the guidance is coming from a better Q3 
uh uh mainly determined by COVID. 
If you do the reverse engineering, what you would find out is that in Q4, 
what we are expecting in terms of revenue is a similar uh uh number to the one we saw in Q3 
and uh with uh a bit a margin of around in the quarter of 40 
41 percent so it's a the the visibility we have in Q3 is the actual, as you said is the better sales COVID sales we 
had in Q3. Okay maybe just a quick follow up and Karlo you have been fairly negative uh in the first of the year on what you anticipate to happen with the COVID pricing, 
can you just comment whether you start to see some pricing pressure on COVID testing or did that still hasn't materialized. No 
uh up to today, we have not seen uh any price effect but this is because 
uh in primary geographies where we operate 
uh there has not been reduction in reimbursements. So in the US reimbursement continues to be same level as before, 
in Europe uh in Italy where again second largest geography for us the government with the emergency decree 
is actually the one buying the products at a fixed price from the different suppliers 
so that will uh guarantees that there is no price erosion. 
Spain, very similar where we have contracts where the price stays as is, so I do not expect in Q4 um price effects 
with one exception uh which is on the overall one is the mix because as you well know in uh in Italy and Europe we sell uh uh COVID 25 percent, 20 
25 percent discount compared to what we offer it in the US and this is again has to do with the different reimbursement system uh in the US. 
If I can move to the liaison IQ which I think is uh your question um the program is uh proceeding in Italy but um 
I have to tell that there is a problem and the problem uh has to do with uh pricing because I believe that uh there has been um 
over 
flow of products made in China that have been flooding uh the European market since we don't have the 
UA approval system that uh I believe as a sheltered the US from this. 
Today you can go to a pharmacy and um Chinese are offering these products uh lateral flow without uh much sophistication 
at uh 1.3 euro. 
So your getting to a point where you need to make a decision uh visa vis do you want to make money or not 
on this lateral flow and if you just sell it in the European market I believe that the situation is very different when it comes to the US um where 
I believe one of the our the primary companies providing these is 
a is a using nine dollars as a as an end user 
price, so if you open it in Italy, today you want to really decide if this is worth or not and so for they time being we have been um uh disciplined in terms of only providing 
this system to those pharmacies that appreciate the 
um the technology added value that we provide, so not a simple strip, but uh the instrument, the traceability and so forth 
but it's certainly the opportunity is uh shrinking unless you accept 
a pri dumping on price which is not what you know we are famous for. 
Okay thank you for this, and maybe my last question, now I remembered and sorry. 
I was wondering if you could give us some qualitative statements around the growth in Luminex in Q3 for the various you 
know businesses, just if you don't want to attach numbers that's fine, but just give us a bit of a feeling how things were going. 
Okay, I'm not going to attach numbers and I give you a feeling, how about that? Perfect. 
Okay, first you need to take in consideration that when you are comparing a Q3 to Q3 in this company, you are really comparing for certain product lines um apples with oranges 
and let me explain you why. 
In Q3 
last year, so this company as far as COVID is concerned has uh uh three products of which one is the Aries uh which is a single plex. 
The other one is uh as a related with uh um Virgin 1 and virgin 2 which were plex panels, 
certainly these plex panels are very manual 
and uh they do not stand visa vis uh uh products which are offered by competition 
but back then remember there was shortage all over the place so uh uh hospitals that had the virgin 1 platform or the NexTag they were actually um taking whatever eh companies were making available at them. 
So there has been a spike that 
back then that today is not repeated not withstilling not withstanding the fact that there is COVID testing volume simply because they migrated away 
from these more manual solutions to more automated solutions okay. 
So as far as, so you need to clean the numbers uh 
the uh of the company if you compare to Q3 last year from the spike effect that is not repeated. 
If you take that away and you look at the Plex business is fairly stable 
and this eh one of the reason why eh again we bought this company because there is 120 million dollars of business ex COVID, 
ex COVID effect between virgin 2 and xTAG that is a nice solid business and is a business where we tend to build clearly growth for 
uh with the launch of the virgin two years on uh inaudible 
When it comes to the Aries, I believe compared to last year we are um uh miles better uh than <laugh> than we were 
and this is to the fact that we been able, the company has been able really to um bring up the manufacturing volume and stability 
in manufacturing and today we are really serving we are selling like around 
230,000, 240,000 a month of this of the cartridge, back then 
I think we are at 50,000 
and so you understand that there is and not because there was no demand but because there was no ability to manufacture uh at that point. 
So that component is doing well 
and uh also we keep um placing some of the Aries system in Europe and US so that's 
uh proceeding fine. 
When it comes to the LTG uh business is uh is uh is booming. 
I mean if you look at the growth versus last year is around 20% 
and um and the reason is that there is you know this business is not a life science business 
and during the heh when we gonna have the investor day, we gonna clarify this, 
this has nothing to do with life science, 
this business is fundamentally has to do with the fact that the multiplexing technology that this company invented 25 years is 
has been made available to partners like Thermo Fischer, Bio-Rad, Bioteknik with 
instruments that the company makes 
and this uh uh the beads and the system have been utilized by these uh partners to develop products in the space 
of research, clinical research or um like uh for Thermo Fischer One Lambda 
in the case of transplant For Thermo Fisher inaudible, in the case of transplant, uh, LVD. 
The fact that, uh- uh, clearly, um, some of these programs have been, uh, very successful, 
if I look, for example, at the Thermo Fisher business, uh, when it comes to all the protein, uh- uh, testing business, antibody testing business is booming. 
Or when I look at the fact that his life science, uh, business, in business of dollars have been pulled and will be pulled into the- into the US, especially, 
by the past and current, uh, administration, that explains why this business is really growing significantly. 
And I see this, uh, again, as an opportunity, 
in some of these fields, uh- uh, to work, uh, with a partner and now launch programs, uh, which would include also liaison technology, 
in some, uh, clinical spaces, where we believe the multiplexing, inaudible technology can really offer, 
uh, an opportunity to the partners. 
So, is a very profitable business, by the way. Uh, as you- and you understand. It is a solid business. 
This company has been manufacturing now for 20 years, and so that component, uh, I think, uh, is performing better than what we expected, 
and we expect, uh, this to be, uh- uh- uh, in line in terms of growth, to, uh, so not diluted, vis a 
vis, uh, the- the group, uh, the group revenues, uh, growth in the foreseeable future. 
Again, Maya, we're going to be discussing these, um, better in more specifics, uh, during the, um, during the investor deck. Understood, thank you very much. 
The next question is from Peter Welford, with Jeffries, please go ahead. 
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Um, I've just got two left, I think, please. Um, firstly, um, just to try and understand, with regards to the cost synergy. 
Um, how much of that 55 million cost synergies is, um, potentially, I guess, have to be delayed, or- or slowed down, 
um, given the need, as you said, to invest in the- the manufacturing improvements that you're doing? 
Um, or- or should we regard that, just anyways, being, if 
you like, the- the just being some of this investing you're doing in Luminex, is more offsetting, if you like, upside or near term upside to that 55 million? 
So, I guess what I'm asking, is- is the more than you'd initially assumed, required in the near term, 
or is that to some extent, anyway, offset by conservatism in that original 55 million aim? 
Um, second question then, is- is just in regards to the- the Luminex platform itself. 
I think there's been, um, a lot of discussion around the- one of the issues in the- in when you actually use these cartridges, 
um, has been that, um, that there's been a- a- a reasonably high, relative to some of the peers, error rate, initially using them. 
Just wondering whether you think the- the manufacturing changes that you're doing, will that also improve the error rate, or is this purely focused on the manufacturing of the warning letter, 
and what steps are underway to potentially improve, 
um, the- the reliability, I guess, of the- of the Luminex system, before you roll it out under your name? Thank you. 
Okay, so as far as the synergies are concerned, uh, we said 55 million, and, uh, they're gonna come alive in the next, uh, three to five years, I'm very comfortable 
about the synergies. 
I don't think there's gonna be any delay, 
uh, we actually took in consideration the fact that, 
um, we are gonna, uh, some investments are gonna be necessary, uh, in order to, uh, achieve some of these, uh- uh, synergies. 
But, I'm very comfortable with that number, 
and I don't think there's gonna be a delay, and this is nothing to do with the delay on version two manufacturing. 
When it comes to the, um, version two, the cartridge, uh, I think, uh, you- you- you- you put it, uh, um, in the right term. 
Look, 
um, uh, we… were- it- this company, when I learn about this company, is that, uh, 
um, it- it is a step and not- a still a notch 
away from being an IVD consolidated manufacturer, and this, 
uh, is clearly explainable by the fact that if you think about this company was actually built around the research- research. 
Uh, very successful research, uh, products. 
Today still, uh, as said, that the hardcore of this company, the Luminex, 
is that business, and then, uh- uh, the company stepped into- try to step into, uh, accelerator growth in diagnostic, buying technologies, or buying other companies, uh, around- uh, around the globe, around the US, and, 
uh, and bringing that IVD, uh, well needed uh- uh, infrastructure to the- to the company. 
The problem I believe that, uh, some of the companies that have been bought were small, and not necessarily properly structured, and certainly from a quality um, 
from a quality system point of view, I believe, uh, behind what are, uh, the, um, expectations in modern IVD. 
I believe the 483 that, uh, was actually, uh, given to the company, 
uh, had to do with, uh, some of these delays, or some of these, uh, the way that, uh, the company was 
operating, that, uh, we are in the process of, uh, correcting. 
Um, by the way, uh, we have decided, uh, that, uh, we are gonna, um, participated to- anyway, we've been accepted, 
uh, to participate, to a pilot program that the FDA has issued in the US, uh, where n- uh, nine companies 
are gonna be enrolled into a- a program where the agency together with, uh, a consulting firm that the agency has, um, actually, uh, selected to use, 
they're gonna be working with a company for 18 months, and during this 18 months, they were gonna redesign uh, the, uh, quality system, 
and we're gonna redesign it in light of, uh, what are the most recent expectations, uh, by- by the agency. And this, uh, to me, is, uh, 
great, because uh- uh, as far as Luminex is concerned, it's clearly focusing the people to the program, is giving a- a- a free access, by the way, 
to 
one of the top notch consulting firms that, uh, the FDA is putting- is making available at no cost, uh, to the company, to, uh, redesign the quality system. And my expectation is that at the end of this process, 18 months from now, we're gonna pretty much exit, 
uh, this program, uh, with a very modern, up to date and FDA blessed, um, quality system. Okay? 
As far as the cartridge, and what you said, uh, again, uh, 
I think, uh, you are very right, and, the problem is that, uh, the cartridge we found, and the manufacturing 
system we found, we found over here, was not really, uh, ready to launch a product. 
It was, uh, ready for, a prototyping launch, uh, which is not a tradition of DiaSorin, you know, being an IVD supplier, we look at products, uh, finished products, uh, launched to the market. 
Also, we are talking about a much bigger inf- commercial infrastructure. So, we would expect the ramp up of volumes to be faster 
than prior with Luminex, 
uh, and, uh, we did not feel that, uh, we could really go to the- to the market with, uh, um, with the manual, um, manufacturing lines, 
and a process that was very cumbersome, prone to errors, so 
where are- whereas the- the company already order some, uh, fully validated, 
uh, completely automated lines that now we are in process of validating and putting in- into, uh, operation. 
And then, uh, we are gonna conduct clinical then, uh, with a much better, uh, process, uh, under control. 
So, long story short, 
um, we always- is very clear that, uh, when it comes to multiplexing, uh, this is, uh, is not a space, uh, where, uh, uh, you- you- you- we- we're gonna be pioneering, 
is a space that today, already has, uh, good solutions. 
And, uh, so, uh, the only way, in my opinion, to make it to that space, uh, is with a system that is very solid and stable, 
with, uh, the complete panel. And, uh, what is very attractive, uh- uh, of this system, in my opinion, is the flexing concept, the ability to utilize the flexing 
concept that provides flexibility 
of the- the launch of the panels in, uh, especially in the European countries where you know, all the reimbursement are different, and also in the US, where there has been a recent push 
backs, uh, vis a vis the complexity of the panels, uh, that are offered, uh- uh, by the competition. 
Clearly, if you want to make money with the flexing concept, you better have your manufacturing costs under control, 
uh, because certainly there is, uh- uh- uh, a margin effect on the flexing concept, and this is why 
company more established that today are selling products, uh, can not really go back to that concept, they would be killing their business. 
As far as we are concerned, uh, we want to have all ducks in a row, and the manufacturing cost under control before we launch it. So, when we launch it, and we are gonna- we are gonna make money, right? 
Sorry, I was on mute. That's great. Thank you very much, very clear. The next question is from Scott Bardo with Better America. Please go ahead. 
Uh, good evening guys, thanks for taking my questions. Um, so 
I've got a couple of questions for, uh, Piergiorgio, please, and one high level question for- for- for you, um, Mr Rosa. 
Um, Piergiorgio, just- just wonder if you can, um- um- um, please qualify, 
I think at the- the last, um, uh, H1 up- update, you, um, I'm- pro- provided an implicit guidance for 
15% growth for your base business, ex COVID. Um, 
I just wonder if you could now give us, um, you know, a- um, a- an update on what your expectation is this- this year, on that basis, so outside of the scope of consolidation, ex COVID. 
That would be helpful, please. 
Uh, and second question for you, Piergiorgio, please, 
um, so, um, the- the revenues coming in from Luminex, I think, um, uh, were better than we expected, and- and I think you talked about performance, um, being pretty- pretty decent, uh, there. 
Um, I- can you confirm please, whether Luminex original guidance to the market of $480 million is still on track, this year? 
Um, and maybe give us a sense of what COVID was for Luminex, last year, um, roughly speaking, what you expect it to be this. That would be helpful. Uh, and 
I'll follow up with, uh, Carlo in a moment, if possible. 
Thank you. Uh, so, let me start with the first one. Uh, 
I believe, uh, what we see, uh, um, as we said before, the in case, in the guidelines, to say that we are 
now at the high, uh, uh, in the, uh, high, uh- uh, part of the inaudible, has been even by better Q3 
sales, and mainly by better COVID sales. 
I believe we have commented at length about the- what we see in the ex COVID 
business, uh, which is going, uh- uh, which is going, uh- uh, very well, 
uh. And, uh, uh, in terms of the ex, uh, COVID sales for DiaSorin business, uh, for the remainder of the year, 
I believe, uh, that what we said in H1 was 15%, 
uh, and I think that that- that is still the right, you know, the right number. The way in which we look at it. 
N- n- n- it's, uh, it's… it's there, you know. Uh- uh, one- one percent better, one percent, uh, lower, but that's- that's the right number. 
In terms of, uh, the guidance, uh, for Luminex, the 480 million, I believe was said a few times, that when we modeled the 
Luminex business, uh, we didn't take face value that guidance, we didn't take face value, the- the plan that they put together- 
crosstalk. And when we check what made public, uh- uh, in- over the filing that followed, uh, the- the- uh, the acquisition, 
uh- uh, so, uh, we didn't use that fa- uh, face value, we used a different one, a lower one. 
Uh, and, uh, we are- uh- uh, a little bit, uh, um, better than what we modeled toward- toward this year. 
Then, for uh, 2022, and so on, uh- uh, I believe you need to wait until the inaudible market day, when we would be more- more- more specific. 
In terms of, uh, COVID sales, uh, I believe Carlo said that overall in the quarter, 
DiaSorin plus, uh, Luminex, uh, accounted the- uh, COVID sales accounted for 30% of the total quarter sales. 
Uh, the Luminex part of those revenues, uh, you know, we said 91 million euro, of, uh, Luminex sales in the quarter. 
I believe, uh, both partner, though on the top of my head, that the, um, uh, COVID related sales, uh, COVID only, right? 
So not taking respiratory panel, COVID only, is, uh, ballpark, uh, 15, uh, 15 million, uh- 
uh, euro, out of those, uh- uh, 91 million euros. 
That's very helpful. Uh, thanks Piergiorgio. And- and- and question for you there, Mr Rosa, please. Um, there's been some market speculation about a potential tie-up combination between BioMarin and Qiagen. 
Uh, Bio- ma- uh, Maria, of course, having an immuno-assay business and Qiagen, of course, being a- uh, a player in- in QuantiFERON. So, 
I wonder if you could talk to, a little bit, about your current relationship with Qiagen, and where- whether any combination of these two companies could impact your ongoing relationship with QuantiFERON, and inaudible, 
and so forth. Thank you. Listen, uh, Scott, since I am in Texas, uh, I think I can use the fifth amendment, 
and, um, I will not, uh, comment on, um, on this, uh, rumor and speculation because I think, uh, 
again, uh, today is a rumor and a- and a speculation. Um, uh, 
I can comment on the fact that, uh, the relationship today, uh, with, uh, my good friend Thierry is, uh, is doing very well. 
I believe that, uh, in Europe, uh the program today, is- is, uh, almost to maturity, because together we have been, uh, driving the 
conversion and, uh, growth of this business, and today we are working on, uh- 
uh, actually, uh- uh, Qiagen, uh, still works on, uh, driving- 
uh, demand, so testing volume, now that we have a- 
um, almost, uh, 400 accounts today, that are using, uh, the product on our platforms. 
In the US, uh, we are at the beginning of, uh, the story. 
Uh, we had a very successful conversion of, uh, one of the two largest uh, labs in the US, uh, to the technology. 
We have, 
um, uh, today, um, a very significant number of hospitals that are using the XL, and, uh, together with Qiagen, we are working, and we are eagerly waiting for the approval, uh, of the access, uh, because in the US, we s- we see the mid-size, 
uh, hospital, uh, market as an untapped opportunity. A lot of this business is send out, 
and, uh, we can catch, uh- 
capture the business as a- at the price range, uh, that, uh, is- is really makes Qiagen, both parties, uh- uh, very- very hap- very happy. 
I would like just to make, uh, one comment Scott, uh, to the famous 480 million that, uh, you were discussing about. 
Look, uh, um, if you look at the- at those- at those 480- uh, 80 million, uh, there are two components to it, that, uh, did not materialize, 
and actually, they were in the expectation of Luminex, and when we look into it, we decided to de-risk. 
Um, one is to do with the fact that, um, in those numbers, you had a version two launch, 
in, uh, 2021, uh, which we- we know, 
uh, we expected not to happen, uh, when we make certain decision as DiaSorin, about the launch of this product. 
The second thing is the fact that, uh, in that, um, assumption, there was a certain dynamic of, uh, increase of manufacturing capacity, 
that, uh, eventually did not happen, and so the- uh, today, the- the volume is capped at, uh, 230, 240,000 testaments. 
I believe that plan was actually calling for an increase, uh, that, uh, would have taken the company behind that- that number. 
So, if you really take out these two effects, and if you look at that number, uh- uh, we- I think we- we are running pretty much to where the company was saying, 
with, I believe, a better mix, uh, which, um, may- does contribute to profitability, 
which is an LTG performance, which is evolve, uh, expectations. 
Mr Rosa, there are no more questions registered at this time. Okay operator, thank you. Take care.
