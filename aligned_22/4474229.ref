Just please simply type in your question at any time, and press send. 
The company may not be in a position to answer every question it receives during the meeting itself, however the company review all questions submitted today, 
and publish responses where it's appropriate to do so. These will be available via your <unk> company dashboard, and we'll send you an email when they're ready for your review. 
I'd also like to remind you that this presentation is being recorded. 
As usual, before we begin, we'd like to submit the following poll, and I'm sure the company would be most grateful for your participation, and I'd now like to hand over to Neill Ricketts, CEO from Versarien. Good afternoon, Neill. 
Good evening everybody, and thank you, Mark, for the introduction. Uh, 
I'm joined today by uh Chris, who's gonna walk us through the uh, first half interim, so the financial details, 
and then uh, I'm gonna be joined by Steve, who's gonna specifically talk about the activities in South Korea, and uh, uh, and what's been going on out there. 
Obviously, you know, as Mark said, we'll be answering some of the questions as we go through the presentation, 
uh and any live questions that come in, we'll do our best to answer, but all questions will be answered, uh post event. 
So uh, Chris, could you lead us through the uh, the interim results please? 
Yes, of course, and good, good evening everybody. 
Um, the uh… as, as you're aware, we publish the results, uh on Monday, and I will just very briefly take you through those results. 
Uh, the uh, the first slide that we're going to look at, uh just summarizes those results and the headlines. I think most people will have actually seen them, 
uh but uh, just, just for the sake those who may not have done, 
um we were pleased to report that the group revenues from continued operations were up 41%, 3.8 million, from 2.7 million the previous period, 
and we refer to continuing operations here, um because we have classified the uh, revenues that were from the aluminum business that was based in Cheltenham, 
uh which we announced as being discontinued, as a discontinued activity, 
uh they were consequently um, in these results, they're classified as such. 
Which means from an accounting perspective, 
uh we have to structure the income statement slightly differently from that which we've done previously, and bring in the net results of those discontinued activities as one line, 
uh hence the, the reason that referring to uh, to continuing operations here. 
Um, it's worth noting that any relocation, what redundancy costs in relation to that move, are classified as exceptional, 
uh and there's a note in the interim statement which uh, which details that. 
Uh, also, the ongoing lease costs at Longhope are broadly similar to that of Cheltenham, but of course, they provide upgrading facilities and space for expansion. 
Uh, the revenues that were derived from our graphene activities, were up 166% to 0.93 million, 
and in the comparative period last year, they were 0.35 million, 
and we'll come onto a little bit more analysis of that later on. 
Uh, the adjusted <inaudible>, which is this primary measure that we use to uh, to report for the business, 
on continued operations, had reduced by 37%, so those losses were down by 37% to 0.71 million, 
uh from 1.16 million in the comparative period. 
Uh, the reported loss for the business as a whole, including the discontinued operations, uh was 3.1 million, compared to 4.34 million in the previous period, 
and the loss before tax for continuing operations was 2.96 million, again, down from 4.3 million in the previous period. 
Uh, and uh, the balance sheet dated the 30th September, our cash was up to 3.5 million, compared to 2.4 million uh, the previous period. 
So, just a little bit more about the key points for the revenue, 
um that increase in revenue of uh, 1.1 million came from two sources, 
uh half a million pounds is from the recovery of the two mature businesses, AAC and TC, 
uh and you may recall, we now report into business segments, one is mature businesses, one is technology businesses, 
and the graphene revenues of 0.9 million, uh that were reported, um come from two sources as well. 
They are derived from the, um from product sales, 0.3 million comes from product revenues, 
and 0 si- 0.6 million comes from graphene product development uh, agreement, being the DSTL agreement that we announced back in November, uh 
2020. 
Uh, and it's worth just noting that since um, we started work on that development agreement, um for product u- um, for DSTL, 
uh, the uh, the total contract was 1.95 million, which we announced, and the totaled income that we've recognized to date on that 
uh, on that project is 0.9 million, so there's still a further million pounds to, to recognize, 
uh, uh, on that particular project. 
If we look at um, as the cashflow and the balance sheet, um, and we look at the, the burn rate for H1, 
uh, the monthly burn rate is roughly 0.4 million, uh and that is made up of the net cash that's used in operations of 1.2 million. 
Uh, the intangibles that we have capitalized, uh for G SCALE primarily, 0.9 million, 
and then HP/lease repayments we've made are 0.4 million. 
Uh, that comes to a total of 2.5, so for six months, ru- roughly our monthly burn rate is 0.4 million, uh as reported for the first half. 
Uh, if you compare that to the, the cash and the headroom we've got, uh of uh, of six million at that same date, 
uh we had repor- we reported in the balance sheet that we had uh, bank balances of three and a half million, 
we had headroom on our invoice finance facilities that we could draw down if we wished to, of 0.8 million, 
and we have 1.7 million that was still undrawn, uh from the Innovate UK Loan, 
which is the total of the 5.5 million, less the 3.3 million that we had drawn at the balance sheet date. 
Uh, we also have proceeds from Lanstead, um, which will be coming in, um over the next few months, um until 2022, 
um they obviously depended upon the share price, 
um the first Lanstead uh, instruments um, expired in April 22, and the second one in July 22. 
Um, so you know, if we're looking at our monthly burn rate of 0.4 million, our cash/headroom of six million, further proceeds from the Lanstead instrument, 
um we can uh, I think we can leave you to draw your own conclusions about uh, the level of funding that we actually have. 
Uh, we also expended 1.1 million in the first period on scale up equipment, which is a significant amount for us. 
Uh, and we should also bear in mind that, you know, the Innovate UK is a loan, 
um but that that loan does not start to become repayable until 2024, so we're some time away from having to consider, uh the repayments on that particular loan. 
Um, so that's the, that's the sort of the, the, the main part of uh, of the uh, 
um, uh, the numbers, um so I'll uh, I'll had you back to Neill, uh to take you through some other things. 
Thanks, Chris, so in terms of operation <inaudible> 
high lives, obviously we are known to be uh, the investment from uh Graphene Lab Limited, in South Korea, of uh, just short of £2 million, 
uh that includes also, a royalty agreement and uh, the trademark agreement. 
Uh, that's kind of part of our strategy moving forward, which is to add these uh, key, key kind of uh associations with 
uh, our customers and our suppliers. 
In terms of other things that uh, 
happened, we are now in the process of commissioning the uh, Spanish assets, that's an entire fraction that was moved over from Spain in this period, including all of the machinery, the testing equipment, 
which I'll touch on later on when we talk about the expansion at Longhope, uh 
and we've uh, as Chris said, we've spent £1.1 million on scaling up processes again, something that we'll talk about a little bit later in the presentation. 
In terms of uh, things that have happened on the customer side, we're very focused around our textile development, and also our concrete development, 
uh and you'll have seen that we've signed agreements with <unk> and… or Cross <unk> should I say… 
uh, and also, Superdry, and 
I was very fortunate to go with the designers and the senior management to the opening of their new store, where we talked about the impact of graphene, uh on their garments, moving forward. 
Uh, in terms of uh, uh, other things that are going on within the business, although we're focused on uh, the textiles and the c- 
and the construction, uh we also have a number of other agreements in place, where we're developing uh, through Steve's team, uh things like, uh materials for the packaging industry, 
and uh, we're very pleased to be working with some of the large dispatching companies 
that are ou- are out there. So, it shows that the business has a huge amount of traction now, and is moving forwards in a very focused way. 
In terms of the post period highlights, uh we obviously uh, 
secured uh, under uh, Steve's leadership, uh a grant with a member of uh 
key, uh partners, uh in terms of developing our Gnanomat technology out of Spain, into Pseudo-Capacitors. Uh, 
these are required where we're looking at electrification of transport. Uh, 
I've already talked about Superdry, and how we're working with uh, Superdry on uh, multiple projects, 
uh and um, lastly, we uh, managed to sneak into the interims there, 
a royalty agreement that's been signed with Gerdau, who are one of the largest steel manufacturers uh, if not the largest steel manufacturer in 
Brazil, who have started up a graphene production, um graphene exploitation plan, uh to look at replacing their steel business, 
uh and we're working closely with those on a number of projects, but the first one which has come out as a royalty agreement is around 
using our mask predominantly in Latin America, where unfortunately, COVID is still 
um, very prevalent. 
I think that's uh, a great um, kind of step for the business in terms of uh, getting Gerdau on board, and working very closely, 
both at the graphene engineering innovation center up at Manchester, which is where our 
m- our, some of our graphene development happens, but also looking at our global footprint, which now includes s- uh South Korea, uh North America, uh 
Europe, the UK, and also now, Latin America. 
One of the things that shareholders uh, asked about during the uh, pre-submitted questions, was you know, what's happening at Longhope. 
Uh, this is the very latest picture of our innovation center, which is being constructed at the moment. 
Uh, that's about a 10,000 square foot facility, and includes a state of the art uh, laboratory, uh using some of the equipment that was purchased in Spain. 
Uh, we'll also be doing our own materials testing, 
uh people have asked, you know, what's the main focus of that? Well, it's really about uh, commercial things that customers are not happy being in a more open environment, 
but it's also about uh, defense, and it's about also, looking at the next stages of graphene. 
So, making graphene is one thing, but then actually taking that graphene, and using it in uh, applications, takes an awful lot of uh, 
expertise, and uh, and 
effort, and so, this i- in my view, will be the way that we take the graphene that's produced in Longhope, and then feed it into customer applications. 
You know, how do we get it into uh, a bigger variety of materials, as the business continues to expand? 
Within the Longhope facility, we've actually moved our graphene production from about a 2,000 square foot footprint, up to about an 18,000 square foot footprint, 
and that includes the 17 innovation area, where our robot uh, will be based. 
Unfortunately, there's been a little bit of a delay due to uh, supplier issues, and uh, and, and getting the machine from uh, from Europe. 
Uh, we're still anticipating that we'll have that in place uh, and uh, we'll be uh, commissioning it over the Christmas period, and the new year. 
Uh, we already have uh, uh, have some work to do, uh and we'll be learning how to use that machine, developing this brand new technique, 
and if we get time towards the end of this presentation, we'll run the full video that we showed last time, just to give you and indication of 
the capability of that machine. 
At Longhope, we've increased our ink production, as Chris said, uh, so the ink uh, used in, not only our textiles, but our construction, 
we use graphene nanoplatelets also in construction, 
and we've increased the capacity used in the Spanish assets. 
That's uh, in the process of commissioning, as I said last time, so we've got the first machine set up, 
uh and we're now doing the electrical installation, and the control systems set up, so that we can meet the UK uh, regulations now as well. 
We're increasing the ability for us to be able to test the materials that we're producing, and we're looking at uh, a range of standard materials, uh utilizing the graphene reinforcement, 
but we're also, you know, increasing this research area. 
The slab itself will have a brand new product in it, in terms of recycled polypropylene fibers, which have been reinforced with graphene as well. 
So this'll be a real place to be able to demonstrate, and hopefully, you know, COVID permitting, we'll be able to uh, invite shareholders along to see some of these facilities. 
Shareholders are, uh you know, invited, in fact any visitor that comes to this uh, 
site will require uh, an NBA, and um, uh, and obviously, we're trying to keep all of that information as confidential as possible, 
so access is r- really quite limited, but um, we do l- hope to hold uh, uh, some events, so that uh, shareholders can get 
to touch and feel the, uh the facility, and get an idea of how that has expanded, as I say, from 
2,000 square foot, 
to almost 28,000 square foot. 
Just catch my breath slightly. 
So, uh moving on, uh, 
I'm gonna pass over now to uh, Steve. Steve is down in uh, in Cambridge, and uh, has recently been to South Korea, and he's gonna give you an update as to what's been going on in South 
Korea. 
Steve, can you take over now? Thanks, Neill, and annyeonghaseyo to everybody, that's hello in Korean. 
Um, so as Neill mentioned, uh, just to give a overview, it's almost been one year now since the uh, acquisition of assets from Hanwha Techwin. 
So, just to go through the hi- the history of, of where it all started, 
um and so, Samsung Techwin, uh back in 2009, they, they initiated uh, the graphene business, uh under their semiconductor parts operation department. 
They worked on uh, predominantly, three national projects, uh one with the uh, Ministry of uh Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, 
and <inaudible> with the MSIT, that's the Ministry of Science and ICT, 
and those amounted to around £24 million, 
and the main goals there were to achieve uh, quite large scale growth of single layer graphene, uh by, via the, the chemical vapor deposition, CVD approach. 
Um, lots of e- effort and activity were going towards development of graphene in, in different applications, particularly those that 
will rely on, on roll to roll, very high throughput uh, manufacturing. 
So, a lot of work has been done on looking at the replacement, or substitution of indium tin oxide, ah that we, we find in most of our displays and devices. 
And so, also, along, along those lines, um systems were built capable of producing around 1.6 by 9 uh, 90 uh, 1.6 meter by 90 centimeter scale, uh graphene. 
So that, that uh, was followed by a takeover by Hanwha Techwin in 2015, 
uh who then launched further projects uh, with MSIT, and those were looking to uh, develop new equipment for uh, testing and characterizing 
uh, graphene in a non-destructive way. 
Many of the techniques that we have to use for characterizing graphene can be destructive, 
um but obviously, there's quite a lot of interest in, once we've made large scale samples, how, how to put those into an application, and analyze the quality without destroying those. 
So, there's several pieces of inspection equipment, which have now been transferred over to Versarien Korea, 
um and two of the, the previous, ongoing projects were then completed during that phase as well, between 2015 and 2020. 
Obviously, the uh, discussions with Hanwha Techwin have taken many months, uh during 2020, and I'll go through what's been happening since then. 
Um, so, onto the next slide. 
Our, our story didn't, didn't start there, 
we, we, we date back to around 2017, where, where Neill um, w- first went out to uh, Japan and Korea as part of a Mega Tech Trade 
Mission. Uh, that was a UKTI led 
uh, led mission, and that was where we first met Matt Walker, a part of uh, DIT, Department of International Trade, 
and then, in the subsequent years, uh in June and September, 2018, Neill again visited uh, Korea. 
We're also involved in a Innovate UK Global Business Innovation Program, GBIP, 
uh focused on advanced materials, and again, that led to new collaborations and partnerships in South Korea. 
Uh, in October, 2018, we appointed uh, Rachel Kim, as our Korean representative, who's, who's uh, still with the business, 
and in the, in those uh, years leading up to the, the first discussions, myself and, and Matt Walker, again, since he joined the business, 
we, we visited to, to, again, build networks, build collaborations, um and that was all supported by Rachel Kim. 
So probably, uh, June last year was, was the time where we, we started, 
uh, we, we heard about the opportunity to uh, acquire the graphene business from Hanwha Techwin, 
so obviously, there were several months there of uh, discussions assessing the IP, due diligence, and negotiations, all, all with COVID going on in the background. 
And then it was, it wasn't until December, 2020 that we, we finally acquired the, the assets and the IP from, from Hanwha Aerospace. 
So, that was uh, a busy year last year, and, and, and this acquisition, uh as, as we've presented before, this, this covers more than 100 patents across 29 different families, with uh, protection in, in many parts of the world, 
uh and that's covering everything from the process equipment, 
uh recipes, and, and graphene growth recipe, uh manufacturing methods. 
Obviously, before we, we even start the graphene growth, we need to uh, use a metal substrate, 
and also though, those substrates, depending on their cleanliness, and the quality, and the size of the, the metallic crystals, 
uh that really affects the graphene growth. So, there's lots of know how, and, and IP, based on what we do to that metal before it even goes in the furnace, before we even switch on the machines. 
Um, once we actually make the, the single layer 
graphene, lots of things you can do after the process, because naturally, once it's exposed to the environment, it's picked up certain molecules. 
It can have what we call doping, so it can be 
p doped or n doped, and that might then affect the, the final application that you're trying to develop. 
So, there's lots of things, post treatment-wise, you can add certain chemicals to the graphene surface 
to get electrons to either move, move into graphene, or move out of graphene, so that you can, 
you can start from a clean platform. 
Um, obviously, we're growing on a metal, and that ha- the graphene, if you want to make a semiconductor device, that has to be transferred, 
so one of the key processes is looking at how we can get rid of that metal, 
and so there's a range of uh, both wet chemical processes, and also, dry processes, to get the graphene from the copper, or, or metal onto the substrate of your choice, whether that's plastic, that's glass, 
um or could even be a textile substrate. 
Um, l- lots of uh, uh, 
IP there was also on that metal removal, and that's, that's the chemical process, 
and also, looking at um, end electronic devices, and, and so, several application IP there that we can, we can look to harness. 
Um, so moving onto the next slide. 
This is really the story of the last year, 
so um, month by month, once we did that acquisition last December, 
um the first few months were looking for a new facility for all of the equipment, and looking for strategic partners out in South Korea. 
So, that took about three months, we were searching uh, different provinces in South Korea, uh looking and making sure that we fit in with all of the local environmental policies, 
um 
and yeah, three months later, and following strategic investment from Graphene Lab, uh in, in Korea, we moved into a new facility in May. 
And I'll go onto the next slide where that's based. And uh, 
May was the, the month where the big move happened. Moving everything from Hanwha to, to the new Versarien Korea premises, 
and then, subsequent months, June, July, 
fitting out the <inaudible> installing, commissioning equipment, repairing some parts, hiring new staff… so we've, we've had new technical business development staff join the company, 
uh and they've moved across from Hanwha Techwin, so they've got all of that 
know how and expertise, 
uh that was critical to continuing the business. 
In August and September, we were involved in a, a Korean news program, YTN, one of the, one of their most famous news channels, 
and that was with myself and Matt Walker taking part from the UK. 
And then, probably uh, and quicker than I'd expected, uh we were producing first samples by October, so first, quite good quality, single layer graphene samples, 
um and then obviously, we, we've needed to continue optimizing, and, and improve that process, not just the graphene growth, but the transfer processes as well. 
Um, so I visited the beginning of November, for around 10 days, and that was a great opportunity to meet the new staff, to look at what progress has been made, 
uh meet Graphene Lab. Obviously as our strategic partner, we want to have a, a very good relationship, very f- uh, strong collaboration. 
And also, I had the opportunity to go and visit several academic institutes, meet uh, other commercial 
uh, partners that we, that we want to work with, and or- and also, sign some collaboration agreements. 
Um, while I was there, um we also installed a, a class 1,000 cleanroom, um 
and that basically means we have a, a very low number of particles of, of dust and contamination in the room, so that will enable us to 
provide uh, even, even higher quality graphene materials. 
And then, end of November, we've even see our first sales of CVD graphene material, so that's, that's a huge step 
um, and now we're, we're looking to uh, 
really, uh create high quality data sheets that we can supply to the market and, and provide samples to both academic and, and commercial partners. 
So, here's a map of South Korea, 
um so y- the orange point is, is our new location, so we're in the Gyeonggi province, that's just south of the center of Seoul, we're about one hour south of <unk>, 
uh, we're about one and a half hours from Incheon Airport, and about 30 minutes south of where Hanwha Techwin were formerly based, so that's in a, in a city called Seongnam, 
so it's quite a convenient location, good for getting around Korea, and a- as I say, traveling to and from the city center, or uh, outerlying areas. 
Er, quite a lot of areas around uh… w- we're based in a place called uh, 
Hwaseong, Hwaseong City, and there's lots of other kind of industrial, uh cities around, around that area, so it's a very good location. 
Um, and probably a one hour, er, in, in the south er c- city called Daejeon. 
Many, many large companies, and academic institutes are based in that city as well. So, we're, we're quite well p- well placed uh, uh, at the moment. 
So, couple of pictures, uh of the, the building, you may have seen some of these before, um and some photos here. We've, we've posted some of these on Twitter, 
unfortunately, I can't have uh, videos for you today, but uh, you, you may have seen o- me posting some 
uh, images and videos of uh, machinery being moved from a, a basement level building, up and onto uh, onto these large vehicles. 
Um, and also, another piece of kit that required actually shutting down one of the, the highways, uh in, in South Korea, 
uh was, was the installation of the scrubber, 
so that's, that's a piece of equipment which sits outside the building, which is taking all of the extracts from our processing, cleaning it, and then uh, e- emitting cleaner, cleaner air. 
So, plenty going on, um, here's a few snapshots from our YTN TV news channel, uh with myself. As I said, 
uh, due to COVID, we weren't able to travel at the time, but we were able to 
uh, to film, and this is uh, uh Mr. <unk>, who's the CTO of uh, of Graphene Lab, 
and we have 
quite, quite frequent get togethers to, again, discuss collaborations and, and to discuss what the future holds. 
Here's a few pictures of, of the cleanroom. So, I mentioned, we've, we've recently had a class 1000 uh, room installed, so the, the square room in the background. 
Uh, we probably won't show you inside that, but that's where the graphene is being synthesized, and that's where we do some of the other processes, called uh, lamination transfer, and, and stacking. 
Uh, the rest of the room is hosting uh, quite a lot of chemical, uh 
testing, and graphene characterization, so m- measuring electronic properties, measuring things like the e- the environmental tolerance of, of the graphene that's produced. 
Uh, there's a, a, a room in the back, which I'll, I'll show a picture of in a second, which is another characterization suite, 
and uh, off the page to the right hand side, we actually have a, a wet chemical etching sys- uh system. 
So, as I mentioned, there's two, two routes to, to remove copper from the process, and that can be through a chemical dissolution, 
and so there's uh, different systems here for doing on a batch. R- uh, on the left hand side is a batch scale, 
um, on the right hand side is doing more roll to roll processing, so you can do much larger, larger scale uh, high throughput. 
Um, um, here's a, a final snapshot of the, of the characterization lab, 
so not everything, uh here, but just, you can see a <inaudible> spectr- spectrometer on the left, 
we have a scanning electron microscope in the center, and that has other uh, X-ray characterization capabilities for elemental analysis, and uh, things like that. 
So, um, yeah, very well tooled up now with uh, tools which also can, can help support uh, activities in the UK, because there's equipment there that we don't have in the UK. 
Um, here are some of the first samples, uh, uh, that we've actually sold. 
Um, so, uh c- a customer wanting 
uh, four inch squares of uh, of graphene on different substrates, so eventually, we've supplied it with a, what we call a thermal release film. 
So, this, this means you can transfer the graphene from that copper, using uh, a thermal release tape, 
and so, it's, it's a dry, dry process, doesn't involve d- 
any, uh any chemistry. 
But what we also do, uh, we, we're growing the graphene as a single atomic uh, single layer of atoms, 
but then we can actually stack this up, uh and we do that uh, stacking these layers one by one, 
um because for certain applications, you, you might need a lower sheet resistance, so you want something that has a bit more conductivity. 
Um, and obviously, steel is, is optically <inaudible>, 
um so we have a lot of expertize in, not just the growth, but also this, this stacking and transfer process, which is, is crucial to, to many of the 
uh, applications being developed. 
So, there's me in the lab with uh, one of our technical guys, and 
uh, uh, uh, again, wu- one of, on the right hand side, signing a collaboration agreement with uh, one of our partners, SD Lab, 
uh and so that again is uh, possibly more focus for uh, the UK business, but, but would involve technology from uh, Versarien Korea. 
Uh, so SD Lab are, are developing a novel, uh antimicrobial devices, and coatings that 
uh, all sit nicely alongside our existing technology developed with uh, 
with Gnanomat. So, so that should be a good collaboration, and there's further uh, potential there to work on uh, different kinds of sensor to detect antimicrobial species, 
um which will go alongside some of, some of their intended products. 
So that's, that's really exciting, and uh, I think one of the questions uh, o- on the, on the channel was, 
you know, i- is, is Korea just going to be focusing on CVD graphing, and, and the answer is no, definitely not, because 
uh, obviously, we want to further establish and, and push what we're doing in the UK out into, into Asia. 
Um, so although predominantly, the f- the focus will be on, on manufacturing CVD graphing for sale, 
uh, we, we need to develop further academic and commercial opportunities, 
and, and also, we can now support that those CVD activities in the UK, Europe, and, and the US, and we're w- you know, other parts where 
uh, Versarien already has a footprint. 
Of course, key ob- uh, key to this is forming that strong relationship with Graphene Lab, uh who are a strategic uh, 
investor, and with, with, with them, we're l- we're looking to develop commercial sensors, and other 
optoelectronic devices, and also work alongside uh, potentially, some national projects, uh via our key to South Korea. 
But yeah, a- absolutely, looking uh, to further extend the nanoplatelets, and other products that we're 
producing in the UK. <unk>, HP Materials, the <unk>, which is uh, material 
produced from the, the Spanish assets that, that Neill talked about. Hexotene is, is still being uh, produced and we're looking to develop new applications with, with the hexagonal boron nitride. 
The <unk> again, w- a lotta scale up going on in, in Longhope at the moment, and uh, I call 'em <unk> but you know, Gnanomat materials, which are quite a wide portfolio at the moment. 
And then of course, the product 17 Polygrene graphene, we're hoping to push these out into South Korea as soon as we can. So, 
I think that's it for me, Neill, I'll pa- I'll pass back uh, to yourself, to, to finish up. 
Yeah, just going back to that last line actually, Steve, we've already started that uh, er th- those conversations with our standard range of uh, pro- products and processes, 
so um, you know, that's uh, that's something that we're continuing to brief our people on. 
Last line to the presentation is really about our environmental statement, which is, you know, Versar- we believe that Versarien's in a unique position 
to deliver, you know, substantial environmental gains by using the key technologies that we've developed. 
Uh, if we look at concrete, we know that we can uh, we could reduce the environmental impact by up to 30%, which is obviously very topical at the moment. 
That's not the only thing that uh, Versarien could affect. 
Things like uh, 
light weighting in the automotive and aerospace applications, and Steve's team's still continuing to work on the uh, 
the European graphene um, flagship project, where we're looking at uh, key components for the aerospace industry to change the way they do things, 
a really disruptive technology, 
uh, but we're also looking advanced building materials, we're looking at recycling, bioplastics, 
uh and so, pretty much everything that we're involved in, including energy, has been… that someone talked about in th- in the questions and answers that have been going on at the moment… 
they all have a massive impact in, in the way that uh, you know, the, the environment is currently being uh, you know, looked at, so, very topical. 
Uh, that concludes the, the kind of presentation, but we've got some questions here, and uh, be interesting to go through some of the questions. 
Um- Th- th- th- that's great, Neill, let me just give you a small pause, so you can uh, break between the Q&A. So, uh thank you to you all for, for your uh, for your presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, please do continue to submit your questions, 
using the Q&A tab on the right hand corner of your screen. But just while the, the guys take a few moments to review the <inaudible> questions submitted during today's meeting, 
I'd like to remind you that a recording of this presentation, along with a copy of the slides, and the published Q&A, can be accessed via your dashboard on the Investor Meet company platform. 
I'd also like to remind you that your feedback will be important to the company, and immediately after this presentation's ended, you'll be redirected in order that you can provide the company 
uh, with your thoughts, your views and expectations. 
Um, Neill, not a lotta time to, to look at those questions, but I guess you've had a bitta time throughout the presentation. 
If I may, can I just hand back to you to read out the questions where you think uh, it's appropriate to, to give responses to, 
and uh, obviously, as you previously mentioned that uh, the Q&A that was pre-submitted, obviously, that's you'll have a chance to review that, and put some responses to that as well. 
So, if I may just hand back to you, just to read out the questions, that'd be great. 
Thank you very much, Mark. We've tried to answer as many of the pre-submitted ones as we can, as, uh, as we go through the presentation, but 
um, uh, what we'll do is we'll, we'll do our best to answer all of those. 
There were a few questions about gross margin, and about 
um, uh, you know, forward looking statements, and stuff like that, and that's not really our job uh, in this presentation. 
What, those kind of things will be covered by certain research notes, so you know, 
we can, we can look forward to, to getting some coverage there, and, and that should answer some of those questions. Uh, 
Steve, uh Mike had a specific question about the South Korean facility, and whether, you know, that's currently set up, uh to do samples, or you know, does it need to be scaled up? 
You know, my, my kinda response would be, we're always in the process of scaling up, but there's always uh, a need to get bigger, to, to look at more available markets, but what's your view, Steve? 
Yeah, it, it's very application dependent, 
so if, if you are wanting to go into the display market, you obviously need to make graphene as big as possible, and this as uh, high throughput as possible. 
However, there's, there's tons of applications if you want to make a sensor. Uh, you can make thousands of sensors with just like, one centimeter square of material, 
so um, yeah, it, it, it really depends on application, but we, we have uh, everything in place to, to be able to make uh, graphene useful in a range of applications. 
We will obviously, need to work with other partners, we need to find other, because we will not be able to do everything, 
um, we will not be able to make a f- a final product, 
uh and also, for example, working on things like biosensing, we need to work with some other partners that actually have some of that expertise that they can bring to us, 
and, and so, yeah, it, we've got, we've got everything we need to uh, to develop prototypes and other 
uh, yeah, for, for a number of different applications, so that if you want anything else there, Neill, uh- No, that's fine thanks, Steve. Um, hopefully that's answered your question, uh Mike. 
Uh, <unk> asked about initiatives in the field of batteries, well obviously, that's covered by our European subsidiary, Gnanomat, 
uh where we have a uh, majority stake there. They're looking at uh, using the graphenes that we produce, 
uh and that's how we came to know about the, the, the Spanish asset, 
uh and then, functionalizing those uh, and, and modifying those graphene materials suitable for super capacitors, uh and, and battery materials, and they've been involved in quite a few projects now, 
they're, they're still, as I said at the time of acquisition, at a very early stage, but uh, ultimately, that's a big market to be involved in, and one that um, 
that we look forward to seeing, you know, quite a lot of progress in. So, yes, we are involved in, in the field of energy I would say, and that's gonna become more relevant as uh, 
as we see the environmental factors change. 
Um, in terms of uh, kind of uh, specifics around, you know, where the CVD was sold, well, we're not gonna tell you that unfortunately, because that will let our competitors 
know exactly where to go hunting. 
Uh, but <unk> asked, you know, was that supplied into South Korea, and I believe it was supplied into South Korea. 
You know, what we see is that we're using the, the global footprint, so that the materials that we're producing in the UK, we can sell those in South Korea, 
and vice versa, the materials that are produced in South Korea, we can then start to sell those in, in the UK. 
Uh, uh Steve, but you know, there's some constraints around that in terms of, this isn't a, a massive factory, 
uh but it is a, uh, enough to be able to satisfy our demands at the moment. 
You're not looking at a substantial amount of capital in the new year either, you know, I wouldn't discount 
uh, the, th- the need if it, if it was driven by a commercial decision, but um, as it stands at the moment, we've scaled up our main primary processes, 
uh and now it's time to look for the commercial uh, draw that's n- that's needed there, 
so let's uh, let's get that, all that equipment commissioned and set up, 
uh and uh, and then produce sales from, from that equipment before we look too, too far. There was a question, a pre-submitted question actually, which is quite interesting, 
which is, you know, do you see, you know, what's your business model ar- around the production of graphene, 
uh and, and I kind of think that um, at the moment, we would uh, look towards uh, following both. 
So, we wouldn't discount centralized gigatype factories, uh but we w- also wouldn't discount uh, a distributed model where it makes sense. 
So, for instance, uh, if you've got a concrete manufacturer, then it makes sense to have a graphene manufacturing plant, 
uh very close to that to cut the logistics of the environmental impact of uh, producing graphene to, to, you know, to the very minimal it can be. 
Uh, <unk> just asked a uh, question now about uh, the green mark, and I think uh, yes, we, we have talked about that. 
W- we've not <inaudible> it yet, but it would be uh, would be part of our environmental push 
to look at uh, the green market of uh, environmental um, changes, and, and uh, accreditations. Um, 
Paul Denney, who uh, is working on a lot of our G SCALE projects, er is our head of sustainability, 
and that's part of his um, his role, to look at our sustainability policies, 
uh and to make sure that um, that, that we're, we're minimizing the impact, not only of our factories, but also working with our customers to minimize 
the CO2 impact of their processes as well. 
Uh, there was a question about why Samsung and Hanwha relinquished the patents and equipment. Well, you'll have seen that uh, roughly pd £24 million was, or $24 million I 
think it was, Steve, was um, was actually uh, put into the business through uh, national projects and uh, 
and 
investment. Uh, the, the business of uh, Techwin was sold to Hanwha, and that included the, the, the graphene assets as, as part of a, a corporate deal in South Korea, 
and then, subsequently, uh Hanwha are not in the business of uh, of developing 
graphene, uh so you know, we have the opportunity to, to buy those assets, and uh, a- and to take on that development for them, 
you know, so uh, that's uh, that, that's kind of my understanding, but um, you're never quite sure in these corporate transactions, you know, what the main driver is. 
Uh, and there's lots of questions coming in now, so uh, there's some technical, financial questions which we'll uh, we'll refer to after the, the meeting. 
Um, there's some questions about super <inaudible>, I answered some of those. 
We're not gonna get graphene into every product unfortunately, because there are price points, and uh, and, and uh th- kind of benefit analysis needs to be done, 
but we are working with Superdry on a, on a, on a large number of projects… uh, well I consider it to be a large number of projects, it's definitely challenging for the team as it stands at the moment… 
and th- and they cover a, a wide variety of different products, so um, obviously, we can't say too much, but that's a commercial engagement, and um, you 
know, it's been um, key to our development in the textile industry. 
But Superdry are not the only people that we're working with, we are working with a number of other people that we've talked about already. 
Uh, we're not gonna talk about uh, our competitors. What our competitors do is up to them, 
uh we're focused on what Versarien's doing, we have a very strong strategy, uh really looking forward to Diane joining us 
as the new chairperson in January. 
Uh, she comes from a background of taking a business uh, very similar to ours 
in terms of its size, through to a main uh, um, a main exchange listing, 
uh, and being involved in that whole scale up. So f- I've worked with Diane, and known Diane for uh, a while, 
I like the way that she works, I, you know, she's very challenging as a chairperson, 
uh, she's very good at corporate governance, and uh, for me, it's about not only exploiting her relationships and ah, her experience, 
but um, you know, for the good of the company, 
but um, also, you know, learning from some of the mistakes, and um, uh, and uh, looking and reflecting on how we can do things 
within the company much better, and I, and Diane is, is very good at that, she uh, comes from an operational background where the business had to scale very quickly, and I think 
um, that, that experience, it will be absolutely key to us. 
Uh, there's lots of questions about um, uh, a- about, you know, forward looking statements and things like that, we can't answer those unfortunately, 
um but we, we will, as I've said before, take those up with um, uh, with uh, you know, various bits of research uh, that we're doing. 
I'm trying to look at the questions as I'm talking as well. Um- 
I think also, worth pointing out that a lot of these technical questions, maybe there's answers in our previous presentation, uh given last month on the, on this platform. 
Yeah, exactly, exactly, Steve, and um, uh, and you know, this is uh, a quarterly update, 
it's, it's very close to the previous one, because the previous one, because the previous one was uh, was 
rese- scheduled, uh and we'd to hoped to uh, to have another of these in uh, in, in the next kind of three months, 
uh so that we can keep our shareholders up to date with what's happening, and that's also an opportunity to, for you to ask as many questions as you can. 
Um, just looking through if there's anything here. 
Uh, do we have any… Brian looks like he's been busy in the US, which is true, 
uh we've got a number of uh, good opportunities in the US. Uh, have you got plans for a manufacturing base? 
Uh, well that will come on, on the back of commercial success if it's relevant, 
so that's uh, one that we're keeping a watchful eye on at the moment, we're quite able to supply that from the uh, 
uh, from the UK. Uh, <inaudible> graphene that went into uh, there's actually seven kilometers of uh, the A1 M. Yes, we did. Uh, that was in the public domain. 
Any news on the university trials in terms of textiles? Yes, 
um myself, uh and uh, and <unk> sat through a presentation a few weeks ago about the test results. Uh, very, very good news as far as I'm concerned. 
That's forming the basis of not only the graphene ware 
website, but also, uh… which Bobby's working on at the moment… but also uh, a white paper which I'm hoping Steve will be working on as well. 
So, uh, how far are we away from <inaudible> make any decisions? 
We're, we're, we're um, at the moment, demonstrating our technology to a range of customers, so that's not a decision that we need to make in the immediate future. Uh, 
God, there's lots of questions here now. I wish <inaudible> a look at it earlier. 
Um, do we have uh, sufficient production capacity? I think I mentioned that earlier. As it stands at the moment, yes, we've got uh, plenty of capacity for what we have 
currently planned, although we don't uh, we're constantly monitoring that. 
Uh, large companies, they, they take a long time, unfortunately, to uh, to, to move, and sometimes it's much better to look at 
uh, smaller, smaller ones. We've got a question here. 
Uh, this is one for you, Chris. Uh, uh, how much of the loan is due in 2024? 
I think um, you know, it's uh, it's a scheduled payment, uh s- that, that goes on for, it's a v- it's what we would classify- <crosstalk>… as <inaudible> soft loan, but. Yeah, 
I think uh, I think we said um, back when we uh, issued the <unk>, we gave the details of that, which was it's repayable quarterly over three years, 
um, so uh, th- th- and that's, you know, that's the capital. Um, we're already paying interest on, on this as well, so, 
yep. 
Um, <crosstalk>- <crosstalk> than the RNS. Uh, there's a question here from, from Andy. Uh, did you enjoy Puzzle X on the panel you were on? Yes, I, 
I did enjoy Puzzle X, it gave me a great opportunity to sit down with uh, <unk>, who came as part of the, the Spanish assets, 
and uh, 
and Roberto, uh to, to talk about our plans for uh, Versarien Europe. 
Uh, we, we kinda hedging our bets over Brexit when we set up Versarien Europe, but uh, I'm pleased to say that Jose Antonio is now part of our team, and I, 
I wanted him when we were first talking to the guys in Spain, so that's, that's a great result for the company. 
He's also part of our business development team, 
so someone asked, you know, do we have an international footprint? Well, we have guys in uh, South, 
South Korea, we have people in Europe, and we have people in the UK. 
Obviously, Brian out in the US as well. 
Uh, do we have any thoughts about future takeovers? 
Um, well, that's always an interesting thing, 
we always keep a, a, a, an eye out on what's happening, we're monitoring the competitive environment in which we, we work. We've seen a lotta people fall by the wayside, 
we've seen some new entrants, and we keep our eye, and 
we support as many people as possible. 
The reason that we support them is, that it's very important for the industry to have uh, 
options, you know, uh, if you have an m- monopoly, it's very, very difficult uh, for large companies to actually 
um, uh, to actually, you know, build a competitive supply chain. So, yeah, 
I actually look forward to having uh, good competitors in the market, because it drives development, and it uh, it keeps everybody honest. 
And uh, and there we have um, you know, a s- er a situation where we're seeing consolidation in the market, 
so yeah, we do keep an eye out on all of our competitors, and um, I'm sure that there'll be opportunities in the future. 
Uh, we also look for acquisitions, as we've always stated, if <inaudible>, they can advance the adoption of our technology, 
so looking for people, both behind us in terms of our supply chain, but also in front of us. 
So, that's an active uh, an activity that keeps both myself and Chris uh, busy. 
Uh, unfortunately, you have to kiss a… there's an old adage, you have to kiss a lot of frogs until you find a prince. Well, acquisitions, there, there's no truer statement, unfortunately. Crikey, 
I'm kind of running out of steam here. 
Uh, there's a, there's th- there's a question mark about how advanced the commissioning of the new <inaudible> equipment is. That's advancing well, 
uh the mechanical side of the first machine is now complete, and as I said earlier, we're looking at the control systems, because it came from Europe, 
we need to <inaudible> compliant with the UK. 
Uh, and um, and we're in the process of uh, of making some minor changes to the control system there, to accommodate that. 
Uh, in terms of um, uh, in terms of communication, we're trying to communicate as, as much as we can. 
Unfortunately, myself, Chris and Steve are actively involved in the business as well, so that limits the amount of 
uh, communication sometimes, we can do. We work uh, quite long hours, 
uh, but we try to keep the business as uh, uh, or the shareholders as informed as possible through every channel we can, 
so that includes podcasts, that includes uh, uh social media, where we have a very tight policy, 
and um, and also uh, events like this. So, we do, 
we do like doing events with uh, 
shareholders, so they can get to see the business, and uh, and hold the directors accountable. So, as far as I'm concerned, that's uh, 
uh, an important thing for us to do. 
Good, I think that's just about us, Mark, 
I'm looking- <crosstalk>… at any of the questions that we, that we may be able to answer. Some of these, we may have to answer after the meeting, unfortunately, but we'll do our 
<inaudible>, our best to answer every question we can. 
That's absolutely no problem at all um, Neill, and thank you very much indeed to all those investors that have taken the time to submit questions today. Um, Neill, 
I'll shortly redirect investors to provide you with their thoughts and expectations, and give you their feedback, 
uh but I guess, before <laugh> uh, doing so, if you've got a few last words, that'd be great, and then I'll uh, redirect everybody. 
Yeah, I mean, I think uh, you know, the first thing is uh, you know, thank you for all your support, thank you for all your questions, and um, you know, 
I guess it uh, it falls on the management team to wish you all uh, the very best of uh, of season's greetings. 
Um, it's uh, it's been a very trying time for anybody that's been involved in business over the last two years, but we've seen a huge amount of progress in the business, 
uh not least the production capacity, but also uh, from Steve's team on the technical side. 
I'd like to thank all of our employees uh, who have uh, gone the extra mile in some very, very difficult uh, 
uh conditions, uh and I'd also like to thank uh, the directors for all of their efforts as well. 
Uh, and so, um, that's, that's all from me, Mark. 
That's great. Neill, Chris, Steve, thank you once again for updating investors this evening. 
Could I please ask investors not to close this session, as I'll now automatically redirect you for the opportunity to provide your feedback in order that the management team can really better understand your views and expectations? 
This will only take a few moments to complete, but I'm sure will be warmly welcomed by the company. 
On behalf of the management team of Versarien PLC, we'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. That now concludes today's session, and good evening to you all.
