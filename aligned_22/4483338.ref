Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Tele2 Fourth Quarter Interim Report 2021 Conference Call. 
At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be the question and answer session. 
To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star and one on your telephone keypad. 
Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. If you require any further assistance over the phone, please press * 0. 
I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Charlotte Hansson. CEO, please go ahead. 
Yes, thank you operator and good morning, everyone. Thank you for bearing with us. Uh, we seem to have a little bit of, uh, of technical issues with the, um, the operator system, 
but, um, here we are. Um, so welcome to the, uh, Tele2 report call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2021. 
Today, I'm very happy that in front of me I have Charlotte Hansson, 
our new Group CFO, sitting here in Kista. And, uh, of course, with me here, Hendrik de Groot, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Stefan Trampus, our Head of B2B. 
So today, we will walk you through the results of the quarter and full year. 
The progress that we have made in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 and beyond, and, um, we will do a Q&A at the end of it. 
2021 was yet another year with impressive results for the group, and I would like to start by highlighting the achievements and strategic initiatives that we have taken. So, moving to slide two. 
So, despite the challenging year with headwinds stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we were able to lift and deliver on our guidance for 2021 by growing end-user service revenue by 1% and underlying EBITDAaL by 5%. 
This was done by continued strong performance in the Baltics as we were able to achieve both ASPU and volume growth, while maneuvering through an unpredictable pandemic. 
In Sweden B2B, we were able to reach stabilization in Q3 and we see yet another strong quarter today. 
In Sweden Consumer, we continued our more-for-more strategy and saw strong performance within mobile postpaid and fixed broadband, while we were able to mitigate the decline in digital TV. 
At the same time, we executed on our business transformation program, which ended the year with an annual run rate of SEK500 million, in line with our targets. 
During the year, we took a major step in our FMC strategy by creating the new premium Tele2 brand through the consolidation of two of the most iconic brands in Sweden. 
And with that, we concluded the first phase of our FMC strategy. 
I am very happy to see the results in Sweden B2B that Stefan and his team has delivered during the year. 
When we presented the new B2B strategy on Capital Markets Day, 
I was optimistic and excited, and it pleases me now to say that they have over-delivered on my expectations for the second half of the year in 2021. 
This improvement is not merely done through our new SME mobile portfolio, but we see improvement across all segments as we are now able to show the second consecutive quarter of growth for a business that was declining by high single digits a year ago. 
In September, we announced the sale of our stake in T-Mobile Netherlands, which was the last step in consolidating our international footprint. 
I'm very impressed by the results the team has shown there during the last years and the value that they have created. And we were able to achieve a very good valuation for the company. 
We expect the transaction to be co- completed soon, and once it is done, we intend to distribute all of the proceeds to our shareholders. 
Tele2 is a strong cash generative company, and as I said during the Capital Markets Day, one of our mid-term targets is to have the best industry shareholder return. 
With the equity free cash flow that we have generated this year or rather last year, 
the board intends to increase the ordinary dividend by 12.5% to SEK6 .75 per share. 
Thi- this puts us comfortably within our leverage range, and as we generate more cash and grow our underlying EBITDAaL throughout the year, 
you should expect us to re-lever the balance sheet to remain around the midpoint over time and distribute that cash to our shareholders. 
And with that, please move to slide three. 
We started 2021 by witnessing negative impacts on the pandemic with the primary headwind being lower international roaming revenue. 
However, during the year, we have seen roaming gradually returning and we are now experiencing a tailwind, albeit, at a lower level than before the pandemic. 
At the same time, we have been able to build a solid foundation for growth throughout the year, which we have seen tangible results for us since Q2 2021. 
In this quarter, we see a continuation of this, and we were able to grow end-user service revenue by 2%, both including and excluding roaming, 
adding up to a 1% growth for the whole of 2021. 
In Q4, we decided to take our foot off the gas a bit in terms of commercial spending. 
Since I became CEO of this company, you have heard me talk about the importance of balancing value and volume in the consumer business in order to achieve sustainable growth in the long-term. 
During the first half of 2021, we focused on monetizing the increased demand for data by our customers by executing on our more-for-more strategy. 
In the second half, as societies opened and market activity picked up, we shifted focus to invest more in market. 
As Q4 normally is a quarter driven by high activity through campaigns, we decided to take a more active part in the market compared to the year before. 
This hampered some of the underlying EBITDAaL growth in the quarter, but creates value for the long-term as we balance the value and volume in our customer base. 
This, coupled with FX headwinds in Sweden and increased inflation, particularly in the Baltics, resulted in an underlying EBITDAaL growth of 1.3% in the quarter. 
Since this was in line with our plan and clearly communicated, we are able to land spot on with our guidance for the year as underlying EBITDAaL grew by 5%. 
As a result, we saw strong cash generation during 2021 with equity free cash flow growing double digits to 5.8 billion for the year. 
In Sweden Consumer, we see continued strong performance in broadband and mobile postpaid, end-user, uh, mobile postpaid, end-user service revenue on the back of our more-for-more strategy. 
With investments in the markets, we were able to see strong ne- net intake in mobile postpaid resulting in the customer base growing year-over-year. 
The renamed Tele2 Play+ continues to show solid performance and we also launched our first SIM offer now in January, 
further future-proofing our role as a player both in linear and OTT universe within the TV business. 
Sweden B2B saw the second consecutive quarter of growth, driven by mobile volume growth solutions and slight tailwind in roaming. 
The mobile volume growth is driven by all segments. Activity within the, uh, solution space continues to pick up despite some challenges in the supply chain. 
The Baltics continued to perform well, driven by both volume and after growth in Lithuania and Latvia, resulting in strong end-user service revenue development. 
During the quarter, we saw some elevated costs driven by increased commercial spending in order to sustain the growth, but also through higher inflation rates, primarily impacting energy costs. 
And on a go- on, uh, on a positive note, in Latvia, we were able to secure spectrum in the 700 megahertz auction and at fair prices, 
which now enables us to start a full rollout of 5G within the country. 
So let's move over to Sweden Consumer on slide five. 
During the quarter, we saw a strong mobile postpaid net intake. And as a result, we were able to grow the customer base compared to last year. 
Postpaid ASPU increased by 2% driven by price adjustments made previously in the year and slight tailwind from roaming. 
Price adjustments made earlier in the year continued to impact the fixed broadband ASPU, which grew by 1%. 
We saw a stronger quarter in terms of new sales within fixed broadband. 
However, this was offset by higher churn in the base as an effect of historically high sales periods in which customers are now rolling off, resulting in somewhat lower net intake. 
In Digital TV, Cable & Fiber, we see continued contribution from Tele2 Play+, which helped us to grow by 3% in the quarter. 
We continue to see a negative intake, which hampers end-user service revenue growth. 
Moving on, um, slide six. 
ASPU and volume growth in mobile postpaid led to an end-user service revenue growth of 2% for mobile postpaid and 1% for total mobile. 
We see continued end-user service revenue growth in fixed broadband of 3%, driven by both ASPU and volume growth. 
Total end-user service revenue for Digital TV declined by 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by continued decline in the legacy DTT 
TV service due to a decline in customer base. 
And moving on to B2B, next page. 
Mobile net intake continued to be strong in the quarter, driven by new contracts, both within SME and large segments. 
The mobile ASPU declined in the quarter by 4%, but we clearly see improvements from the levels witnessed at the end of last year. 
Continued mobile volume growth and strong growth in the solutions business was able to fully offset the decline in the legacy fixed business, resulting in Sweden B2B growing end-user service revenue for the second co- consecutive quarter with 1%. 
Now let's turn to page eight for a Sweden overview. 
End-user service revenue was flat in Sweden as growth in Sweden B2B was offset, offset by continued decline in the legacy services within Sweden Consumer. 
Underlying EBITDAaL was flat compared to Q4 2020 
as the contri- contribution from the business transformation program was offset by FX headwinds and increased commercial spending in the quarter within Sweden Consumer. 
We continued to see strong cash conversion of 64%, but at slightly lower levels compared to previous quarters as we ramp up networks investments related to the 5G rollout. 
Then moving to Baltics, page 10. 
In the Baltics, we continue to see strong volume and ASPU growth in Lithuania and Latvia as we are able to monetize data through our more-for-more strategy and a slight tailwind from roaming. 
In Estonia, we also see strong ASPU growth, driven by price adjustments, while volume growth was hampered by promotional activity from competitors leading to elevated churn in the quarter. 
Moving on, um, naturally this ASPU and volume growth resulted in strong end-user service revenue in the quarter, and we saw growth of 14% for the Baltics. 
Underlying EBITDAaL grew by 7% in the quarter as a strong end-user service revenue growth was partly offset by slight pressure from rising inflation rates, 
primarily impacting energy costs and higher commercial spend in Lithuania and Estonia. 
And I would add, uh, also an adjustment, um, you know, an accounting adjustment related to handsets. 
But with that, I would like to hand over to Charlotte, who will take us through the financial overview. So welcome Charlotte, and I hand it over to you. 
Thank you, Kjell, and good morning, everyone. Before we dig into the Group financials, I'd like to give a quick take on my first impressions of Tele2. 
During my first weeks here, I can see that in the last couple of years, Tele2 has built a solid foundation to become a leading telco in the Nordic and the Baltic region. 
This includes investing and developing an organization that can create sustainable growth, best sharehol- industry shareholder return and lead in sustainability. 
The Group leadership team that I have joined includes several individuals with a long expertise of the telco industry, both domestic and international. 
And after working in several different companies outside of the telco industry, I believe I can contribute with an outside perspective in order to improve and excel the already fantastic results that we have seen, as we will, which we will continue to achieve going forward. 
It's our job now to show that we can deliver on our mid-term ambitions and illustrate that we are a growing company. 
Please turn to page 13 in the presentation. 
As in previous quarter, we have created this slide to show the revenue breakdown of our segments, excluding roaming, 
to illustrate that we are a company, uh, that is growing despite the tailwind from roaming. 
Like Kjell said, consumer postpaid continues to perform well as price adjustments made previously during the year 
and volume growth contributes to the end-user service revenue growth. 
Total Sweden Consumer end-user service revenue declined by 0.6% in the quarter, 
excluding roaming, as growth in mobile postpaid and fixed broadband was offset by decline in legacy services. 
In Sweden B2B, we see continued strong momentum in mobile and solutions, offset by decline in fixed legacy services 
and total end-user service revenue remained stable, 
despite roaming being excluded. 
In the Baltics, the strong performance continues, resulting in 13% growth, primarily driven by higher ASPU and volume growth in Lithuania and Latvia. 
For the Group, this led to an end-user service revenue growth of 2.3% in the quarter excluding roaming. 
We now see that roaming revenue is starting to come back in a material way as outbound roaming increased by SEK25 million in the quarter compared to Q4 2020. 
However, this is still not close to the roaming levels that we saw prior to the pandemic. 
Please turn to slide 14 for the Group results. 
Underlying EBITDA grew by 1% organically in the quarter, driven by end-user service revenue growth and contribution from the business transformation program. 
However, this was partly offset by higher commercial spending, primarily in Sweden, but also in Lithuania and Estonia and FX headwinds in Sweden. 
We also see higher inflation rates impacting the costs, primarily through higher energy costs, 
items affecting comparability of minus SEK117 million in the quarter 
primarily stemming from restructuring cost taken in the quarter, which releases… um, relates to the continued execution of the business transformation program in Sweden. 
The decrease in net profit for continuing operations compared to Q4 2020 
was primarily driven by the close down of the operation in Luxembourg, which had a positive impact on the results by roughly SEK3 .3 billion in Q4 2020, 
but with no impact on equity. 
There is also higher amortization of the Com Hem brand compared to last year, following the brand merger in Q2 2021. 
So let's continue with the cashflow on slide 15. 
CapEx paid decreased to SEK971 million in the quarter, driven by higher network investments related to 5G in Sweden. 
Working capital was strong in the quarter as we saw three separate items that had a positive impact. 
Firstly, we settled the receivable in the quarter of roughly SEK325 million. 
Secondly, the timing of an accounts payable was favorable in the quarter, where we expect to see the opposite effect in Q1 2022. 
Thirdly, we see continued contribution from external handset financing in the Baltics. 
Taxes paid declined compared to Q4 2020, primarily driven by preliminary tax in Sweden for the year 2020, which was repaid in the quarter. 
All of this, uh, led to a quarter with remarkably strong, uh, cash generation of SEK1 .8 billion in equity free cash flow. 
For 2021, our continuing operations have thus generated SEK5 .8 billion or SEK8 .3 per share. 
Please move to slide 16 to go through the capital structure. 
Economic net debt rose by SEK0 .2 billion in the quarter as we paid out the second tranche of the ordinary dividend of SEK2 .1 billion. 
However, this was largely offset by the strong cash generation in, uh, in the quarter. 
At the end of the year, leverage was 2.5 times, which is still in the lower end of the target range of 2.5 and 3. 
Uh, with the proposed 2.5% increase in ordinary dividend for the financial year of 2021, 
we will comfortably be within our range, and we remain committed to maintaining leverage around the midpoint of 2.5 and 3 over time, 
and re-lever the balance sheet as we grow underlying EBITDAaL in order to distribute excess cash to our shareholders. 
In addition to the ordinary dividend, we also intend to distribute the full proceeds from T-Mobile Netherlands transaction as 
soon as the transaction is closed, and we have received the cash proceeds. 
With that, I will hand over to Kjell. Thank you very much, Charlotte. And then please turn over to slide 17, uh, where we will go through the business transformation program. 
So far, we have reached an annualized run rate of 500 million, with savings of 150 million affecting the P&L in the quarter and 355 million for the full year. 
And we are now entering the last stages of the transformation program. 
These last stages include three major operational improvements within the business: 
decommissioning the 3G network; 
improve efficiency within our consolidated IT and technology organization; and decommissioning our remaining IT stacks once we have migrated all customers. 
Firstly, the close down of SUNAB, which we have already started, will increase the efficiency within our mobile network and reduce the amount of sites 
that we have as we consolidate towers and move frequencies into one company, Net4Mobility. 
Secondly, when Tele2 and Com Hem merged, we realized certain synergies within the technology department by merging the fixed and mobile network organizations into one. 
When Yogesh joined the company, we further consolidated the technology and the IT department into one organization 
in order to improve collaboration within that organization, but also with the commercial units. 
From this, we expect to realize further synergies. 
And thirdly, we have so far already decommissioned two of our IT systems, and in 2022, we'll carry out the major IT migration elements, which will yiel- yield the largest cost savings and vastly improve operational efficiency. 
When we consolidated the Tele2 and Com Hem brand, we created a new IT stack on which new, uh, FMC customers are put. 
Now, the job is to migrate existing customers onto that IT stack as we currently operate different brands on different IT stacks. 
With all customers on one IT stack, we will vastly reduce the internal complexity, 
simplify the product portfolio, and reduce the time customer, uh, the customers spend with customer service. 
This is of course not an easy job. We- we have already started migrating our first customers with successful results. 
However, in order to secure quality in all these complex projects and enable stable commercial momentum, we will extend the deadline from end of 2022 to end of Q2 2023. 
This is purely a matter of timing in order to optimize our ways to deliver on our mid-term ambitions. 
We are still confident that we will achieve the target of at least SEK1 billion in annualized run rate savings by the end of the period. 
At the same time, we are able to guide on mid-single-digit growth in underlying EBITDAaL despite less, uh, contribution in 2022 
from cost savings, which I will talk about on the next slide, demonstrating the long-term growth journey that we have embarked upon. 
This is about saving costs, but it is also about building sustainable growth. And we need to balance those two things. 
So, moving to slide- slide 18. 
I am happy to announce that we can now guide for the full year in accordance with our mid-term guidance. 
We expect low single-digit growth in end-user service revenue and mid-single-digit growth in underlying EBITDAaL for 2022 compared to 2021. 
We expect CapEx, excluding spectrum and leases to be in the higher end of our range of 2.8 to SEK3 .3 billion, 
driven by investment, primarily in our mobile network as we ramp up the 5G rollout in Sweden and the Baltics, 
but also investment in the fixed network through RemotePHY. 
For end-user service, we expect to continue the momentum that we had since Q2 2021 by making all countr- countries contribute to the growth as we leverage the continued performance in the Baltics and return to growth in Sweden. 
We expect Sweden B2B to continue the positive momentum that we have seen during the second half of 2021. 
This does not mean that we will grow Sweden B2B every quarter during the year, but our aim is to stabilize and grow the business for the full year. 
In Sweden Consumer, we expect the momentum in mobile postpaid and fixed broadband to persist through our more-for-more strategy. 
We also expect to see continued momentum in the Baltics to provide support for the entire Group. 
The end-user service revenue growth will filter down to underlying EBITDAaL and we will continue to execute on the business transformation program. 
The program remains back-end loaded in the year, and we expect to reach the majority of the remaining annual ra- run rate in 2022. 
As I pointed out, during the first half of 20- 
of 2021, commercial activity advert- advertisement was significantly reduced, uh, during the, um, that part of the year 
and we have now focused on bringing sustainable growth back in the second half. 
And this leads to some investment in the market. 
This, coupled with the phasing of the business transformation program, will result in year-on-year underlying EBITDAaL trends to be more favorable from the summer of 2022, 
as we will continue to invest, um, during the year. 
We today also reiterate our mid-term guidance similar to our guidance for 2022. 
In this guidance, we aim for sustainable growth for the Group with continued contribution for all countries, while the business transformation program 
will continue to give tailwind to underlying EBITDAaL up until the first half of 2024. 
For CapEx, we expect to be at the high end of our guidance during the peak of the 5G rollout, 
and we will gradually reduce CapEx spending as we complete the 5G rollout and improve the operational efficiency through the business transformation program. 
So then, please, uh, turn to the next slide for the key priorities going forward. 
In Sweden, we will continue to ramp up 5G investments in order to increase customer satisfaction, which will support our more-for-more strategy within the mobile business. 
Similarly, on the fixed side, we see the upgrade with RemotePHY as an opportunity to increase capacity and speed in order to main- maintain reliable growth in our broadband business. 
We will continue executing on the business transformation program to deliver at least SEK1 billion of savings by the end of, uh, Q2 2023. 
In Sweden Consumer, we will continue to balance value and volume in order to build sustainable growth, while gearing up our capabilities to address the 1.3 million non- FMC households. 
We will also continue to build our premium brand in order to increase customer satisfaction that we can monetize through reduced churn or price adjustments on the back of product improvements. 
In Sweden B2B, we will continue the turnaround that we have started during the second half of the year by executing on our new granular approach with clearly defined segments. 
In the Baltics, we will continue to build on the performance that we have seen and execute on our mobile-centric convergence strategy 
through more-for-more offers in order to make sure that we can sustain the growth. 
With the 5G auctions now concluded in Latvia, we will start to ramp up the 5G rollout, while preparing for the auctions in Lithuania and Estonia. 
At the same time, we will continue to develop and explore FMC capabilities. 
And lastly, we aim to close the T-Mobile Netherlands transaction soon and which we intend to distribute all proceeds to our shareholders once the transaction is closed and we have received the proceeds. 
Tele2 is a growth company at heart, and we are witnessing positive results from our strategic initiatives, which demonstrates the viability of our way forward. 
I am confident in our ability to succeed and deliver on our 2022 and mid-term guidance and excited to continue building sustainable growth. 
And with that, um, I would like to hand it over to the operator, so we can, uh, do a Q&A. 
Thank you. Dear participants, we will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press star and one on the telephone keypad and wait for a name to be announced. 
If you wish to cancel your request, use the hash key. Once again, please press star and one if you wish to ask a question. 
The first question comes from, of Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. 
Yeah, good morning everyone. I- I had a couple questions and reflecting on, around the cost, um, base of your business, um, because 
I guess that's where the greatest investor focus is today. 
So just firstly on, um, the costs in the quarter and that you, 
um, highlight will continue into the first half of 2022 in terms of sales and marketing costs. 
Is that purely phasing, or do you think there is, uh, a sign there that the cost to compete has gone up in the market? 
Um, and then second question, just around- around your mid-term cost cutting, uh, which you have, uh, pushed back by six months, 
which you, one of your peers KPN did yesterday as well. 
Just wanted to try and understand, has cost cutting or cost efficiencies become harder? 
Um, or has COVID changed the scope of that cost reduction? Trying to understand a little bit more why the delay. 
And the- the key reason for the question really there is, we're trying to think about 
whether you can continue to create further efficiencies further out 
than- than middle of 2023 and trying to understand how much scope there is for, um, long-term, 
uh, greater efficiencies in the, in the company? Thank you. 
Yeah, let me start and then I would invite maybe one or two colleagues here. Let me take the second one first on the mid-term cost-cutting. If- 
if, uh, we were single-mindedly focused on cutting costs, we could have done the trans- the- the transformation, uh, program by the end of ' 22. 
But what you see is, in the second half of ' 21, we are actually able to get back to, uh, meaningful growth, uh, in Sweden. 
And I really would like, uh, for, uh, Stefan and Hendrik to not have too many freeze periods, where they have to… uh, where they are limited in their approach. 
And I am quite confident that that brings more value, especially in the medium term, 
getting the business back to growth rather than, uh, fast forwarding, uh, this cost-cutting program. 
To deliver on this, we will definitely do it. 
Uh, there is no doubt about that. 
Uh, but from a value perspective, 
I think the sequencing that we are putting now, where we are taking the last of the big migrations 
in the first quarter of 2023, uh, is a better one for- for- for our overall business. 
And we talk a lot about the sales and marketing cost. And- and, uh, of course, this is just a sign of the market becoming more normal again. 
So, um, we have comparisons where- where they were very low levels. You saw we had a huge uptick in our EBITDAaL in the first part of ' 
21. Um, and then, of course, there… since we are very, very transparent in the way we go, uh, to market and operate with you, 
I could have made a bridge to you easily, that will take us back to the, uh, the, um, uh, consensus of 3.7 by pointing out, 
uh, individual elements related to an, uh, an IFRS adjustment we have done, the electricity cost in- in 
the Baltics and some exchange losses. 
And we will be back at 
what the consensus was, 
um, but this is how we are. We are maybe a little bit too brutally honest with ourselves. 
Um, so let's not overdo the sales and- and marketing. I do not know, Hendrik, do you wanna add few comments to that? 
Uh, yes, um, Kjell, I'm pleased to. Hey, Andrew, hi, and thanks for the question. So, on the sales and marketing cost that Kjell was saying, 
we of course, um, you know, need to look at where we are in the fourth quarter against early in the year also from a, you know, return to normality point of view and that of course brings you, 
um, in general to a little bit of a normalized level also on your marketing and sales cost. 
And then within that, the fourth quarter is typically a- a very high trading season. 
We do a lot of the, you know, promotions, a lot of the handset and device sales 
and actually we have done, we've performed quite nicely in the quarter, I would say, particularly on the mobile postpaid side. And then on your question, how will that translate into- into next year? 
I would say, you know, as long as we get out of, uh, let's say back to normality and out of COVID, you will see, of course, a, you know, a normalized run rate again. 
Um, but within that, the fourth quarter is a higher cost quarter and I'm… 
And I also would like to point out that a lot of that commercial cost is driven by acquisition costs and not as much as marketing costs, which I saw on some of the commentaries, 
because we have, of course, also been able to get, um, some, you know, transformation savings on to our marketing spend 
by moving to, uh, one brand. So, uh, there is a lot more related cost to volumes. Okay. Thanks. Thanks very much. 
Can I just- just follow-up on, um, the longer term. Say, what you are seeing in the, in the company at the moment, does that give you confidence that, 
um, there is, there is further, you know, costs, uh, or efficiencies to go after post the mid-term, 
um, uh, plan? Or do you then rely on operational gearing to- to drive the growth forward? 
Yeah, that's also why we are reiterating our mid-term guidance. 
And there are… I think we can say that there are cost savings. There are cash savings. 
Uh, the- the Swedish model, um, has, uh, also quite a lot of capitalized expenses, expenses for consultants 
that's a bit unique to Sweden. 
So, at the end of the day, I do see a scope for improvements beyond the program that we have now defined in terms of, 
uh, reduction of cash spending in the company. 
Hello? Excuse me, Andrew, have you finished with your question? 
I think you dropped that. You might have dropped that, but sorry about that. We're having some problems with the, with the webcast everyone. Well, let's go to Ulrich then. 
I think we can go to the, to the next question of the operator. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ul- Ulrich Rathe from Jefferies. Please ask your question. 
Uh, thank you. I have two questions please. The first one is bit of a follow-up on the, on the earlier one. 
Um, just to clarify, when you talk about the phasing of commercial events, um, in this regard to the BTS, um, sort of change, 
is that the customer migrations or is it other commercial events that you are referring to? 
And also, um, is this informed, um, this plan informed by anything you see in the market, actions by competitors or competitive, um, levels overall in the market? Or is it simply 
going back to the drawing board, you know, putting together all the, all the plans and sort of deciding it's- 
it's- it's better to sort of shift it out by six months? Is it more internal or external? That is the first question. 
And then the second question is, 
um, you mentioned during your prepared remarks that there was sort of a bit of a wave of contract expiration in the first quar- in fourth quarter due to, you know, 
I suppose, high sales in prior fourth quarters and then this contract sort of expired and created higher churn. 
Was this… How- how do you see that, right? I mean, that's generally you wo- you would hope to not to see high churn when contracts ex- expire. 
Was this sort of a normal rate and just the higher underlying contract expiry? 
Or was there a reason why more people percentage-wise of these expiring contracts decided to leave Tele2 or- or- or ask for- 
for some better terms? Thank you. Yeah, okay. 
I will do the first one and Hendrik will do the second one. 
So, you are basically asking why do we shift to six months? I- 
I actually see that as, uh, a signal of strength in the business. 
If we were not succeeding in the go-to-market, then we would redouble the efforts on costs to try to compensate. 
The- the thing here is that I see that both Stefan and, uh, now Hendrik has the opportunity to build sustainable growth 
and then it is 
easier to let them have a little bit of maneuvering space in the go-to-market. 
So, it is a decision that we have made internally based on how we think we can get the most value out of the approach. 
So, if we see-the, see the opportunity, like we do now, to have sustainable growth, it makes sense to give them a little bit more space and have… 
uh, do not be bogged down by too many freeze periods. 
Uh, so overall, I think this is good news. 
mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. Sure, Kjell. Sure. Ulrich, just thanks for your questions. 
Um, so first of all, just to- to confirm a couple of things. First of all, on, from a commercial point of view in the consumer market, we are really executing on our value strategy, 
right? So, we're- we're- we're trying to, you know, to drive value into the market and of course with that also increase the overall value in the market for, you know, um, for the industry. 
And- and with the, with that we are in a, we're in a regular cycle that is recovering coming out of COVID with typically the fourth quarter being a very high trading season with, 
you know, some, um, additional commercial spend just from the quarter itself. 
If we look into, take this forward, 
then what you can expect is that we, uh, you know, in- in ' 22 we'll be able, as we recover from, uh, COVID, although we still have some weakness in, you know, the end of January and in January as we speak, 
we will be able to get to a better sustainable commercial rate, 
uh, but not at the level of Q4, 
uh, not the high level of Q4 because that is a seasonality and not at the low levels we've seen earlier in- in 2021, where we were very much focused on, focused on EBITDA in the midst of COVID. 
Um, then in terms of what happens with the customer base, 
we've seen, uh, that, you know… And I- I think your- your question particularly pertains to broadband and our, you know, net intake of, 
um, of 1k versus a normal rate of, you know, a mid-single-digit rate. 
And I think we have sort of been guiding that. What happens in this quarter in particular around broadband is- is, you know, 
uh, that we had a pretty decent sales rate, although we've had some impact, you know, from COVID on some of the channels, uh, that has sort of given a little bit of softening. 
Uh, but in particular, we've seen, uh, for this quarter that we have 
had, um, campaigns that we've had over the last two years, the 24 months campaign and 12 months campaign, 
that have both rolled out and sort of ended in this quarter. And typically, if we roll off a campaign this always comes with a level of churn. So, 
because we've had now two sort of these campaigns all happening in this quarter, we've seen some, you know, additional tick up on, uh, on churn, 
um, and that's sort of key driver for the rate. 
And that is not a continued, a continued trending, that is very much, you 
know, a, uh, a- a particular event in the, in the fourth quarter, and I would say underlying our broadband, 
you know, traction is still around sort of that mid, mid-single-digit rate. Um, and what we… 
And then lastly, what we typically do in terms of, you know, migrations, we, as we execute on more-for-more pricing strategies, we continuously 
move and upgrade customers to, of course, our new front book and of course also to, 
you know, our- our new product sets that we have. And if you mean migration in that sense, yeah, that is what we continue to do as- as part of more-for-more. That's very 
helpful. Can I just clarify the very first question that- that I asked? The- these commercial events that you specifically 
talk about in the report as- as sort of the phasing of that informing, the de- delay to the BTS, 
what exactly are these commercial events? Is it the- the migration waves? Is that what it is or what is it? 
Uh, yes. Okay. So yeah, we probably put it more clear in our language. So specifically what- what I'm trying to say is that… 
Um, let me take a historic perspective on this. 
My predecessor, uh, made a decision, which I think was right at that time 
to focus on, uh, EBITDA and cost because of the- the uncertainties around COVID. 
Now we are at the end of this thing, and we have seen that we've been able to get meaningful growth back into, uh, all main lines of our business. 
Then it makes sense for me and the management team to focus on getting that growth going. 
And the commercial events that I mean that is that, for example, uh, Hendrik is planning a campaign in an important period of the year. 
We do not want him to be too restricted by, uh, constant freeze periods. 
So, by sequencing the B2P program, so that it fits well with our go-to-market, we are able to do both of these things 
and, um, that builds the most value for the business. 
<inaudible>. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
The next question comes from the line of Andreas Joelsson from Danske Bank. Please ask your question. 
Yes. Good day to you all. A- a question on leverage. You have been at the lower end of the leverage for quite a few quarters now as the slide showed. 
Is there anything that would change that view? 
Or, uh, if I am being a little bit blunt, what is preventing the board from moving you to the mid of the range that you expressed? Thank you. Yeah, I, you can… 
I can start, and you can take over, 
Kjell. Um, just we have had a, um, very positive 2021 from a cash flow perspective. 
And a couple of things have come our way that has been really, really helpful. 
We expected it and it has happened. So, you see a- a very high cash flow, uh, generation in the business. 
And we do remain committed to the- the policy. We will be reviewing this. 
Last year we paid an extraordinary, uh, when we announced the second quarter. 
Of course, I cannot say anything about what we are gonna do this year, but the- the board is very committed to our policy. 
So, if we see that we will be, uh, over time, trending significantly lower than what we have said, 
then that will be reviewed, for sure. This… 
We have no desire as a management or as a board to- to hold back, 
uh, any, uh, any significant amount compared to what you expect. 
And of course, one thing we are doing now is that we are handing out when the deal closes in Netherlands, the entire amount, 
despite the fact that, you know, from a ratings perspective, some of that revenue would have been, uh, calculated by S&P as future, uh, contributions. 
So- so that is a signal of strength, uh, from our side. But yes, we remain committed to the policy, and we will be monitoring that. 
Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Nielsen from ABG. Please ask your question. 
Thanks very much. Um, morning 
guys? Um, just a question related to, again, to the transformation program, but the, um, the internal side of it. You've spoken about the market side, 
please. Uh, Kjell, on the IT migration, um, transformation, et 
cetera, is this running according to plan? Or are you seeing some- 
some issues here, um, uh, that is sort of, uh, moves this also slightly into- into the next year? 
That was my first question. And- and just second one. Kjell, um, we are seeing a slight weakening of trends in the TV business. Could you give us any indication or- 
or- or, you know, qualitative comments on how- how do you view the TV business, um, moving into this year? 
Thank you very much. Let me do the first and then the second one, I will hand over to, um… 
So and on- on the, um, migrations, we have actually started that process. 
Uh, so, one of our main brands is, uh, is moving to- to the, um, to the new platform 
and we have not had any unexpected things there. Actually, it's been relatively smooth, I would say. 
These things are never super easy, but, uh, there has not been any kind of red or even orange flags coming up there. 
Um, so- so again, uh, our- our reasoning for- for the choice we have made is exactly, uh, what you see is what you get. This is our thinking. 
We really wanna make sure that we extract the most value from the market in this, uh, in this process. 
So, um, we are, we're very confident about the business transformation plan, both the number and of course now the- the timeline that we have set. 
And I think it is definitely the right thing to do in terms of a value creation perspective. 
Um. Yeah, 
Kjell. Hey, Peter, on the TV or- or in entertainment business, uh, just to, um, give you, um, sort of some insight there. 
Uh, in last year's, uh, 
Capital Markets Day, I think it was very clearly launched and stated that, you know, our aim is to, uh, stabilize and modernize our entertainment business to also, you know, contribute to driving value for the overall consumer business. 
Um, and that's basically still our aim. So, we, you know, our aim is to stabilize this business 
and- and to make the necessary adjustments so that we can really, you know, move into, 
uh, into streaming and get more solid fundamentals in the DTV business. 
What you see if you look at, uh, you know, the numbers underlying, you see at least the revenue level that our, 
you know, cable and fiber, uh, entertainment business is- is sort of starting to stabilize, whilst we still have some, 
you know, decline on the, on the legacy DTT side. 
Uh, and that is in- in part, 
uh, coming through from, you know, the, uh, you know, uptake we're seeing on our streaming business, which sits in the, in the, you know, cable and fiber numbers. 
Um, again, we're still early on because, uh, since we've now just rebranded Com Hem Play+ into Tele2 Play, 
uh, we've, we're seeing some good growth momentum and that's also where we are now launching, you know, linear streaming into the portfolio. 
This is, again, a first step, uh, into a, 
you know, continued modernization journey, uh, for our entertainment business that again in the end should be able to stabilize, you know, the total TV line 
over time. Okay. 
Thank you very much, Kjell. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stefan Gauffin from DNB. Please ask your question. Um, Yes. Hello. Um, 
I have a question on mobile ARPU. Um, 
uh, 
there was a slightly weaker, uh, growth momentum on the ARPU side for both the consumer and 
the, uh, 
business mobile, uh, this quarter compared to Q3. 
I'm just wondering if that is, uh, a result of campaigning or if it 
is, uh, increased mobile competition or due to phasing of price increases? 
Just, uh, help me understand sort of the development on- 
on, uh, mobile ARPU. 
Okay, Stefan will start and then Hendrik. 
Yeah. Hi, Stefan. Uh, thanks for the question. Uh, and on B2B then, uh, if you look at the comparison versus last year, 
it is true that we have a- a decline. 
Um, but if you look on the long, uh, 
trend, we are decreasing that revenue or-or ASPU decline that we have seen in the B2B segment. 
Um, so, uh, looking at the efforts that we are doing, uh, keeping more disciplined around our pricing guidelines, 
uh, focusing on value, uh, and- and making sure that we take a responsible stance in the market, 
and we're challenging ourselves all the time to making sure that we get the right price from our B2B customers. 
And we can see that is actually resulting in improvements. Uh, if you compare to the Q3 and Q4 ASPU, uh, it is a flat development. 
Uh, and also, if you look at the full-year ASPU, uh, we are on the same level as we were in both Q3 and Q4. 
So, I'd say, the strategy, uh, is- is, uh, yielding results 
and of course bringing in more SME customers with a higher ASPU than the- the key and the public sector. 
Uh, it works in the right direction for- for us in B2B. 
I hope that answers the question. And then I hand over to Hendrik. Thank you, Stefan. 
Yes, Stefan and Stefan actually. So, um, I will focus on the, uh, consumer side on the postpaid asked by Stefan. 
And- and basically, what you see from Q3 to Q4 
is typically, you know, that in Q3, 
uh, also this year actually still sort of in that, 
um, lighter touch on COVID, we did have some good roaming revenues as you may remember from our Q3 report. So that typically drives a higher, you know, ASPU in the quarter, which then, of course, you know, coming out of the holiday season 
has an effect on the, on the, you know, ASPU in the fourth quarter. 
And that I think is the main, the main explanation. If you look 
at the, you know, underlying ASPU in the quarter versus last year, we've been growing but by 2% and actually also versus full-year, you know, strengthening the ASPU, uh, development. 
And- and whilst you may think well, you know, from a campaigning there may be, uh, may be a little bit of a campaign, uh, 
low, you know, softer ASPU, uh, coming into the mix. That, of course, to an extent is true, but it doesn't have, uh, any effect on the overall, you know, customer base ASPU as such. 
So, I would say it is mainly an effect from, you know, a strong Q3 driven by, uh, typically, 
you know, roaming and, uh, versus last year, we see a- a 2% growth in the quarter. 
Okay. Thank you. Uh, good explanations from both of you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Stefan. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Francesca Schild from BNP Paribas Exane. Please ask your question. 
Thank you. Um, I have one question please on wage inflation pressures. 
So how do you think of wage inflation risk in Sweden? 
And could you please remind us of the process 
for, uh, for increased wage increase negotiations this year? When that will take place and what you're projecting for the increase? Thank you. 
Well, um, the wage inflation in Sweden is pretty much determined by, uh, the central negotiations. So, uh, I- 
I do not see anything, you know, dramatic coming out of that. 
Tho- those numbers are usually quite responsible. 
Uh, we do see a bit more wage inflation in- in the Baltics, 
uh, that kind of goes with the- the overall, um, growth in the… that we see there in the, in the business and the economy. 
Uh, and, um, there- there is inflationary pressure in the Baltics than in, uh, in Sweden. 
Now the good thing about that is that the business in the Baltics is also pretty good at, uh, pricing their services. So, uh, 
I think the industry in general in Europe has struggled with focusing on- on this, uh, inflation adjustments of- of pricing. 
And you see the, what BT is doing in the UK, as maybe a one way of doing it. We- we think our Baltic colleagues have been overall quite good at it. 
I think probably we could be even better at this in- in the Swedish market. So, um, but to be specific on your question, 
Sweden wage pressures seem to be kind of under control because they are centrally managed, most of it. And the Baltics is also under control but will have a higher level. 
Thank you. So just on that, so do you have… do you think that in Sweden it will be similar the increase this year to last year? 
And have- have the negotiations taken place? 
I think we can, you can expect, uh, overall those agreements to end up in the area of two, maybe 2.5%. Okay. Thank you. 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Pontus Pontus Wachtmeister from SEB. Please ask your question. 
Hi there. Thank you for taking questions. 
Um, on, um, the marketplace, uh, 
I focus on Sweden and 
in regard to everything spoken about before, the positioning in networks and your 5G position and the JV with Telenor. 
Can you describe to us just very top down, how important that is 
going forward in terms of having a good position in 5G, 
uh, and the perception in the market of fast and strong networks and the investments in those? 
And are you aligned with Telenor in that, uh, space? 
Pontus, actually really thank you for that question, because it is something I love to talk about. Um, we have a quite unique position in European telecoms with our network cooperation with Telenor. 
So, we run, uh, some part of Sweden on our own network, but most of it through Net4Mobility. 
And that gives a- a great advantage, because we have the scale advantage and we have also very good spectrum, a very good spectrum position. 
So when we, when the whole 2G, 3G, 4G market consolidates into one 5G market, that is actually a net positive for us at Tele2 
because the combination of Net4Mobility on our home networks will mean that in terms of, 
um, base stations and spectrum, we would have the strongest position in the markets. 
Uh, because right now we are operating with network corporations with SUNAB, with Telia, we have Net4Mobility, we have our own. 
When we consolidate all of this into one, uh, with one network planning, 
we will have the biggest reach and we will have a great spectrum portfolio. 
So, we can't wait to get through this, because it will, it will, if anything, uh, strengthen our position towards, uh, both B2B and B2C consumers in the Swedish market. 
Okay. Thanks. I know it's becoming more important towards the consumer you feel, or is it because in the beginning, you know, people weren't so aware, but now if you look Sweden, efficiency 
is- is more of a divider in the marketplace? Yeah, 
I think we have a good 4G network now. Uh, but the good news is that, when we are moving over to the next technology and we can re-plan the network, 
we will be able to have better reach with fewer base stations, because we are not sharing in- in multiple relationships here. 
So that whole planning, uh, has a- a significant, uh, efficiency in it. 
Actually, I think, Yogesh described that very well at our Capital Markets Day. So, uh, there- there is a clip out there that describes how that journey goes. 
So, um, it's- it's something that we are really looking forward to. 
And maybe to add, Pontus, I- 
I think if I look at the, you know, typical consumer behavior and uptake on, uh, on for example, new phones and handsets, you see quite- 
quite a lot of the phones that we have 
been shipping also in the fourth quarter are, you know, 5G ready, um, and that's sort of making its way into the market quite quickly. 
So, there is a natural uptake by the market. Okay. 
Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Fox-Rumley from HSBC. Please ask your question. Uh, thanks very much. Hello, everyone. Um, 
I wanted to ask kind of, uh, a slightly general question about the way you are thinking on phasing of customer growth. 
Um, from my perspective, today's results show the machine is kind of working. You can turn it on when you choose that allows you to dip in and out of the market to optimize your return on spend. 
But are you saying from today that 
you prefer kind of maintaining business momentum, so it's slightly… it's better to have a slightly smoother approach to- to customer growth through the course of the year? 
Or is it really just that you are kind of correcting for what was a very unusual first half, uh, last year? 
And then I wondered… Um, slightly following up on that previous question whether, or on the question on CapEx, 
um, you begin, you begun the big ramp-up in spend. I wonder if you could just say a few words about how that's going, 
whether you are seeing any issues or any areas where you were ahead of- of plans that kind of thing? Thank you. 
Okay. So, when looking at, uh, our positioning in- in the market, I'm- 
I'm very happy to see that we have a much higher, uh, accuracy now than we had, uh, when I joined. 
Uh, and that is because a lot of people have worked hard on getting their data right. 
One of the reasons why, uh, Stefan is successful in B2B is that they do much better analysis now. There used to be… B2B used to be very volume-driven if you go back in time. 
Now they are much more accurate about the customer needs. They have a much more interesting and relevant discussion with our big cu- large customers and, uh, solutions customers. 
And that is how they can provide value to these customer relationships. 
One of the things we wanna get out of our business transformation program 
beyond saving cost is that, uh, Hendrik, in cooperation with Yogesh, will work much more with big data, be much more accurate in our go-to-markets. 
Tele2 has a history of being a very successful challenger. And that was great in a growing market and where you didn't have such a huge, long tail. 
Now we are a converged FMC player. We need to be much more accurate, 
and that level of accuracy has increased a lot. 
And what Hendrik brings to- to the business here, 
he brings many things. But one of the things he brings is a deep understanding not only on mobile markets and not only of broadband markets, but also the TV side of the business. 
So, the whole picture comes together. 
And- and for us to be, uh, more surgical in our approach between value and volume, we need more and bigger data. That's what we're getting into place. 
That is one of the key things that is happening. 
And on- on the rollout of the 5G, it's- it's moving ahead. 
We actually were able to do a little bit more towards the end of the year than- than we expected. So that- that momentum has really picked up. 
So, we think, um, a lot is gonna be built out in ' 22, and that the main momentum will be done and finished by ' 
23 with of course some build-outs in ' 24. 
So. And the guidance for our CapEx, you have it, will be at the upper end, clearly. 
Uh, and, but we- we have transparency on that. We have visibility on that. Uh, it- it's looking pretty good. 
That's pretty helpful. Thank you. But if I could just follow-up on that first question. 
Um, in terms of the- the staff requirement to become better and more capable with big data, is Tele2 seen as a place where that is a- a, you know, a great, a great career option to be able to, um, have that opportunity? 
I'll start and then if you guys wanna chip in, please. 
Um, one of the things that I did after coming here was to move the big data resources out from being 
more of a staff function to being directly in the line of business. 
Uh, we have people here who are truly, 
um, capable, and they are actually quite motivated now because they're much closer to where it happens. 
They're much closer to the business. 
So- so they- they have really, um, quite a lot of energy in, uh, in putting into their work. 
Uh, and it seems like, uh, they're coming up with a, with a big value add. And do you wanna add something guys? 
Now, well, from- from a B2B perspective, I would say that, uh, in the past in Tele2 we have underinvested in the business intelligence side. 
Uh, that is something that we are changing, 
uh, and- and which we started already next year with the program in becoming more data-driven, and 
to- to Kjell's point, in different manners of- of running the business. 
Uh, we will continue to do that, uh, also this year. 
Uh, and I think the cooperation that we have with- with the units within our technical organization, with the skillset that they bring, 
uh, the cooperation between the commercial and technical parts, that will yield, uh, better control and better, um, uh, performance and execution going forward in- in- in all aspects, 
and not just commercial, I would say, but also from a customer experience perspective, 
uh, and a production perspective. So- so really, really looking forward to that. 
Thanks very much. And maybe- maybe, Adam, just to add, you know, from a consumer point of view. 
I think, you know, customer value management, you probably pick it up also as the operator, is- is really a way to go as you go into a converged strategy. 
Um, you know, that is where we still have, uh, you know, a lot of opportunity and mileage to go. And, uh, as, uh, you know, as Kjell alluding to earlier, 
the IT transformation is quite essential to get that, uh, get that done so that we can really, uh, not just have the data but also act on it through, 
you know, how we build propositions, how we, you know, get the intelligence to the channels and- and et cetera. So, you know, we're- we're in full motion of that, 
um, and, uh, there's clearly a lot of potential still to be… to come out of this as we go through 2022. Great. 
Thank you. Thank you. And the last question comes from the line of Abhilash Mohapatra from Berenberg Bank. Please ask your question. 
Yes. Uh, Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Um, 
I just wanted to come back to the comments around driving, um, improved top line growth in Sweden, please, in context of the guidance. 
Uh, in 2021, obviously, you know, Group service revenue growth of 1%, uh, but all of that was driven by the Baltics with Sweden declining 0.5% and Q4 actually softening a bit. 
So just to confirm, within the ' 22 guide, what are you assuming for Sweden, please? 
Uh, looks like consensus has around 1% growth for Sweden, uh, in both consumer and business. 
Is that something that, um, uh, you're comfortable with? Thank you. Well, 
I can start. Uh, first of all, I think it's very important 
to see the trends overtime here. 
So going from a- 
a quite significant negative trend in- in B2B to- to- to being a stable business was what we said we would do, and- and we've done it. So. 
And then, of course, we wanna take it from there. Stefan and I and others will work hard to deliver meaningful growth there also. 
Uh, and then, of course, uh, we've seen volumes picking up a bit in- in consumer. 
So, our ambition is that all the- the- the main lines of the business, meaning the Baltics, 
B2C Sweden, B2B Sweden should- should be delivering, uh, to the overall growth momentum of the company. 
And then, and then, of course, it will, it will vary over time where the biggest, uh, contribution comes from. Clearly, in the short-term, it will be- be the Baltics. 
Anything you wanna add or? 
No, I think you've put it well. Uh, 
I mean during the year, we've set some strategy for- for B2B with specific cornerstones that- that we shared with you, uh, at the Capital Markets Day. 
We are delivering on- on that strategy to the full extent and that's our focus and also to be consistent with regards to- 
to- to strategy and- and these cornerstones with segmentation 
being a big subscription partner, operational excellence, et cetera. 
And with that, uh, ambition to make a major trend shift during 2022, 
2021 which- which, uh, Kjell just, uh, mentioned. I mean, we have, we have delivered on that. 
And then we are on- on the path of, uh, having the ambition 
to be stabil- stabilizing the revenue growth that you saw in the last quarter. 
Um, and, uh, hopefully that- that- that, uh, answers the- the ambitions that we have, 
uh, and going from minus 7% in- in 2020, uh, to- to- to that level that we see now with two consecutive quarters with- with positive growth. 
Uh, we're- we're- we are, uh, we're proud of that delivery, but we're not satisfied. We will push forward, uh, going, uh, into the future. 
Okay. We have Nick Lyall. 
And the last question comes from the line of Nick Lyall from Societe Generale. Please ask your question. All right. 
Thanks very much. Thanks for squeezing me in there. 
Um, there was a quick, a quick question, please, Kjell. Just, uh, two things. Just I was looking at the- the annual survey, the sort of end of, um, 2021 annual survey. 
Well, could you just explain why that's, why that is or is not a true reflection of the sort of network quality? 
And should we be concerned about your ability to close the gap on TV and mobile prices because of that? 
And then secondly, and apologies if I missed something, but… because I got cut off for a couple of times. But I take your point about the broadband campaigns annualizing. 
But if you were able to remove that, 
would we see in the numbers you are making some headway by taking share from Telia because of their rises in broadband prices? Could you just explain the sort of background to the market on the, on the fixed side and the broadband side in particular? 
And what sort of share you might be taking ex those 
end of campaigns, please? 
So, I will do one and maybe Hendrik does two. Yeah. So, uh, what you are highlighting is an opportunity for- for Tele2. 
We have a good network today and then of course there will always be surveys. There always have been sur- surveys as long as I have been in this industry. 
But what I tried to say on the previous question is that the, going into this setting up the 5G networks, well, we can have, uh, a one to, 
you know, a one network, uh, under our own control 
and not have multiple cooperations. 
The cooperation, Net4Mobility, has, uh, is tested over time. It works really well. 
We are, we are in a good relationship with our partner there with Telenor. 
So 5G brings an opportunity for us to capitalize on that gap that you are pointing out, 
because clearly, we moving forward with Tele2 becoming a converged player, quality, uh, player, gives us the chance to lift, uh, ASPUs over time. 
So, uh, 
when we come out end of ' 23 and early ' 24 with great coverage and great spectrum and a very strong, uh, 5G proposition, that gives us an opportunity to equalize some of that, uh, gap that you are pointing out. 
So, it's- it's a good opportunity for us. 
Sure. Um, and Nick, it will be an opportunity to carry on, you know, the growth momentum I think also through more-for-more on the, on the, on the mobile ASPU, 
um, um, for us, you know, um, as such. And then on the fixed, I would just briefly comment on that, you know. 
Underlying, I think we have still a good trend. Of course, you know, you need to look at the total market, of course, where- where we have 
gotten and if you look traditionally first where we are now, of course, you know, 
uh, we- we do have a mature and- and quite penetrated market. 
Uh, however, 
the, uh, campaign momentum that I was alluding to 
is that, of course, you need campaigns to- to an extent to drive, uh, you know, your- your net adds, uh, on the one hand, but on the si- you know. 
But in this quarter in particular, we have seen, you know, just the, uh, two of these sort of quite successful campaigns, 
you know, coming- coming out, you know, rolling out 
and that has been that specific effect. 
So yes, you need campaigns to drive it. Of course, this need to be well- well sort of, um, you know, planned and scheduled that you don't have these sort of effects that we've seen in this quarter in particular, which we are, which we are doing, uh, as we go forward. 
And, uh, as we also execute on, you know, the FMC strategy, uh, and we will be able to, as we have been alluding to, 
get more out of the customer base and customer value focus, 
we will also, we will also be able to address, you know, some of the churn levels and see some churn reduction. 
So, a continuation on, uh, you know, driving sort of campaigns that are sort of we- well planned, 
um, in combination with, uh, really driving the FMC momentum, uh, throughout 2022, 
I think will give us a good underpinning for our broadband business going forward. 
That's good. Thank you. Thank you. Dear participant, thank you very much for all your questions today. I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Kjell Johnsen, for the closing remarks. 
Yeah. And thank you very much everyone for joining us, uh, this morning to go through the full year of, uh, ' 21 and our outlook for ' 22. 
I'm very happy that we could close the year, uh, on a relatively high note, uh, with basically living up to the guidance increase that we gave you in July of last year 
and that we are now sitting with a guidance that is higher than we had, uh, 12 months ago. 
We have increased our dividend by, uh, 
12.5% and we are recommitted to, of course, as we always are, to the, uh, dividend policy and the capital allocation. 
So, things are looking good. We're gonna deliver on our transformation program, 
and we're gonna, uh, make sure that that does not, uh, interfere with our ability to drive growth momentum also in the Swedish market. 
So, we are making these judgment calls and, um, I'm pretty positive about the- the outlook. So, thanks for joining us today. 
That concludes our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a nice day.
