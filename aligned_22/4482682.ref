Good morning and welcome to this presentation of the SSAB year-end report. 
Uh, my name is Per Hillstrom. I'm head of Investor Relations and with me today is our President and CEO Martin Lindqvist, 
and also CFO Leena Craelius. 
And the, the agenda today we will start with the summary of fantastic year 2021. 
And then, the financials with Leena a little bit more look at the quarter as such. 
And then, we're also very pleased today to present a plan for a much faster transformation of our Nordic production system. 
So Martin, so Martin will spend some time to explain what we are looking at there. And at the end, as usual, outlook and summary 
and we will also have a lot of time for questions here so you will be able to, to ask your questions at the end. 
So by that, please Martin, start with ' 21. 
Thank you, Par, and good morning everyone. Um, I will start with a brief comments in the summary of 2021 
and it was and is or was a historical year for SSAB with 
I would say a solid performance in a very strong market and I will give you a couple of examples of that, 
but, uh, we had an operating profit of almost 19 billion or 18.8 billion in a net operating, operating profit, 
very, very strong net cash flow and net cash flow 12.4 billion and that meant that we could, 
uh, close the year in a debt-free position 
and the board decided at the board meeting to propose the AGM to have a dividend of 5 kroner and 25 per, uh, per share. 
Of course, uh, a lot of this is due to a very strong, uh, 
market, but it's also structured. We have seen very strong demand for our niche products. We have seen good and solid, uh, internal performance. 
If we take safety as one example, we have improved the, the number of LTIs a lot during the year and I would say that that is structurally 
and we still are not at zero, but we are approaching and doing a good job in the organization. 
I think also we had the stable and high production. We saw a successful ramp up 
during the autumn of 2020 after very challenging 2020. 
We saw record output in several production lines. 
Uh, we have managed I think in a decent way to handle problems 
even though they are not fully over with the COVID-19 in, in the, 
uh, at the production sites in the organization. We have also had problems with 
the supply chain issues, shortage of rail cars, uh, sea transports, 
uh, trucks and so on both during the full year of 2021 during Q4 and also into 
Q1 2022. 
Uh, it was a remarkable year in many aspects and I think, 
uh, the first volumes of fossil-free products that we delivered, the first fossil, uh, commercial volumes to Volvo was a landmark for SSAB 
and we have during the year and are continuing with that to announce a number of strategic, uh, agreements with customers 
and, uh, we have or the board has to take in a decision to, uh, speed up the transition and taking a, dire- 
directionally, uh, decision to, to, for a faster transformation. I will come back to that in the end. 
But we have not also market wise only served on, on, on a strong market. 
We have actually been able to continue to deliver on our strategic targets. If we look at, uh, specialties in 2021, 
they almost reached 1.5 million tons and I would say that they would have reached it if we wouldn't have had the transport, 
uh, call it challenges. So they are going to reach the strategic target of 1.6, uh, million tons at the latest 2023. 
Services is moving on. We haven't done any major acquisitions during the year, but we are on our way to reach the strategic targets. 
America's premium share improving over the year 
and looking at SSAB Europe, we are fairly close to the strategic target we have for 2023. 
43% being the outcome of premium share 2021 and still a lot of things to do. 
Automotive, of course, a segment affected by a shortage of semiconductors, 
but still a good growth and if we look at the premium volumes in SSAB Europe, we already ' 21 reached the target for ' 23. 
So ahead of plan, still a lot to do and a lot of interesting prospects. 
And the Nordic market share in line with, uh, our long-term target of between 40% and 45% Nordic market share. 
I said in the beginning it was a marvelous year. We had record earnings in all divisions. 
We had very good EBIT margins, good profitability, and all together the EBIT sum- summed up to almost 19 billion, 
but, uh, Leena will give you some more details on the financials. 
So Leena, I hand over to you. 
Thank you, Martin. Yes. Uh, it is really a privilege to start in my new role with these kind of figures, which I will go through briefly. 
Um, in this, uh, slide if, if we look at the, the graph on the right hand side on the bottom, 
we can see the EBITDA improvement quarter by quarter during this year. 
And definitely the market was favorable. Prices were increasing throughout the year, 
uh, volumes were on the lower side during the second half of the year and the problems already Martin mentioned, 
uh, but if we say that the market was favorable, I would also highlight the good performance of the whole organization. 
I already discussed about the premium mix improvement, uh, 
Europe division, America's improving the premium, uh, portion of the sales, uh, and also 
special steals delivered higher volumes this year so good work in the sales in that aspect. 
Also, the stable production improvement since last year, uh, that is giving, of course, big benefit for the profitability. 
So we can say that good achievement also in that aspect and also the cost efficiency, we were sustaining a good cost efficiency during the year. 
So all that shown in the figures related to EBITDA. 
And then, uh, uh, quarterly figures isolated Q4 comparing to last year, telling exactly the same story. 
Prices on much higher level, they are compensating well the higher raw material. 
Uh, cost base, uh, volume slightly lower compared to last year's, 
uh, fourth quarter. 
Fixed cost on a higher level and this is now mainly related to maintenance activities where we had the shift in timing. 
America's division did the big maintenance during Q3 last year 
and this year we did it instead of during Q4. Also, mobile maintenance, uh, which was done 
during Q4 is something we do only second, uh, every second year. 
And then, the other half is related to personal cost with these high earnings, we are realizing, uh, profit sharing programs. 
And then, if we compare Q4 with the Q3 outcome 
prices did continue to go upwards, uh, compensating again higher raw material cost base, 
volume slightly lower, partially seasonality of Q4 related and also these transportation problems that Martin already mentioned. 
Uh, fixed cost in this, uh, comparison more related to seasonality. Q3 is a vacation period. 
And then, as you can see the utilization of the capacity was higher, a task the, the materials and services also higher in line with that. 
All this good performance led to a strong cash flow, uh, 
Q4 cash flow, net cash flow ended on the level of 5.3, uh, 
4 billion, and the full year 12.4 billion. 
Comparison high level with last year, definitely the earnings played important role. 
They were much higher compared to last year. 
Uh, some negative impact with working capital with higher inventories, 
but nothing to be alarmed about, because the net operating working capital over net sales did develop really well during this year. 
Maintenance expenditures on a higher level. Financial items slightly lower. Taxes naturally higher with this level of earnings. 
Strategic investments were somewhat higher and this is now mainly related to the Oxelosund conversion started and we will continue during next year as well. 
As said already in the beginning, the target set for year-end to be net debt-free, we reached, 
and actually exceeded the gearing ratio at the end of the year being negative minus three, while last year it was 19. 
So the net, uh, cash position positive 2.3 billion. 
Then, when we look at the next year forecast on high level, 
um, the CapEx activities will increase during next year and this is now mainly related to the Oxelosund conversion. 
We were indicating CapEx need for this year 33.5 and we were slightly below three. 
And net interest to be somewhat, uh, lower for next year. 
And then, the taxes higher and that's due to the incurred taxes this year will be paid out next year. 
So on a total level 8.5 is the total cash need estimate at this stage for next year. 
Very briefly about the raw material view going forward or actually this is illustrating the history. 
Um, the iron ore 
peaked during ' 21 started to come down luckily during Q4, but the latest, uh, development is, again, upward. 
Uh, so the outlook for iron ore for Q1 is that it will be on a similar level than Q4 with an upward risk. 
And then, the coal prices they continued to increase, 
uh, second half of the year peaking upwards and they will continue to increase also during Q1. 
This is only few of the raw materials, the bigger raw materials and we know that the alloys, for example, zinc and other materials will continue to go up. 
So overall the cost base is expected to be somewhat higher for Q1. 
And very briefly scrap prices this is illustrating the US 
spot prices. They were on a higher level for Q4. 
Uh, coming down mainly seasonality for January and the outlook for February is that it's stable or might be going upward, so that's still unknown. 
But then, regarding outlook and other issues, Martin will continue. 
Thank you Leena. 
So some words than, uh, about the accelerated Nordic transformation and to start to give you some background, 
uh, back in 2017, we formed the HYBRIT joint venture together with Vattenfall and LKAB. 
And we also inaugurated the world unique, uh, pilot plant for producing, uh, sponge iron, fossil-free sponge iron in 2020. 
During last year, we, uh, uh, delivered or produced the first, uh, sponge iron, uh, fossil-free sponge iron in that pilot plant. 
We also decided to, uh, we plan started, the plan for, to reach commercial volumes of 1.3 million tons in this project or fossil-free sponge 
iron in 2026 in line with the, the need and the demand in, in Oxelosund. 
We then in August rolled and delivered the, the first fossil-free steel and that was, uh, delivered to Volvo Group, uh, to their new TARA machines. 
So in this partnership, we have, 
uh, created the foundation for a fossil-free value chain 
all the way from the iron ore being up in the mountain in the north of Sweden 
until finished products. In this example, the TARA machine from, from Volvo Construction Equipment. 
So this is, uh, what we have created since 2016. 
We have also seen a lot of interest from customers, in, uh, existing customers in our important and focused segments. 
These are examples of partnerships 
that we announced, uh, during last year. 
We have also seen that the demand today 
and especially in the future exceeds, uh, the planned supply of 1.3 million tons in 2026. 
And the demand is not only bigger but also broader, uh, than we currently have the ability to produce. 
And I would say a big part of it is within the mobility segment, advanced high strength steels for automotive and for heavy transport. 
And we have 
had and continue to have and that is only increasing new customers in those segments approaching SSAB wanting to sign partnerships and take part of this development. 
So we have decided or the board has decided to start the feasibility study with the ambition or the 
to, to accelerate the Nordic, uh, strict production system. 
And the idea is to build a new mini mill in Lulea and one in Raahe and close existing blast furnaces and steel shops and so on. 
So build two new compact high efficient mini-mills with a scale of roughly 
2.5 million ton each which is in line with current capacity. 
We expect to complete this transformation during the coming 10 years 
and that is the time is good, because that is before the next scheduled blast furnace re-aligning and the next schedule 
invests, big investments in coke oven batteries and so on. So the timing is perfect around 2030. 
This will allow us to expand the product range in terms of grades, dimensions, and quality within current specialty and premium strategy. 
As one example, we will be able to produce Q&T 2 meter wide with thin gauges, which is asked for by the market. 
This will also give us a capability to run a flexible load of HPI sponge iron and recycle scrap. So part of the discussions and, 
and the partnerships we have with customers is to reuse, uh, the virgin scrap so to say. 
We will leverage existing downstream assets, uh, for the new mills including Borlange, Hameenlinna, <inaudible> construction, cut-to-length facilities. 
And we will build both mills, uh, fossil-free from the start including power supply and I will come into some details. 
If we look at, uh, this graph showing the possibility to reduce with 8 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, 15 years 
earlier than planned. 
If we just put 
what the cost might be or where it is close today or in 2030 without free allocations, because the free allocations in Europe will go away. 
That by itself is equivalent to 7 billion per year in cost avoidance by doing this fossil-free, but 
this, of course, overall strengthen our ESG position as a company. 
If you look into the benefits with these type of mills, 
I would claim that this will give us the possibility to have a structural and long-term profitability uplift. If we look and start with the commercial be- 
benefits, we will have a broader range of specialty and premium products. 
We will be able to increase the sales to Nordic customers in areas where we don't have capacity today and that is asked for. One example is, 
uh, galvanized material. 
We will have a much faster ramp up of fossil-free steel volumes in line with the market demand. 
If we look at the operational efficiencies, we will have a much better cost position. 
Lead times will be completely different. Today we have lead times of 6, 8, and, uh, sometimes 10 weeks. 
We will build mills with lead times below two weeks. 
We will have said avoid costs for CO2 emissions and we will re- de-risk the carbon dioxide cost exposure 
and we will also take, try to take away this less small, the small last part of, 
of, of, uh, emissions by also looking into using biofuels in Oxelosund to become 100% fossil-free. 
If we look at the increased operational fle- flexibility and as, you know, we are used to run mills like this. We have two of them in US. 
We will have lower fixed costs 
and a much better ability to adopt to, to swings in demand. It's much easier with a mini-mill and electric arc furnace. 
It's in practice, if you put it bluntly, 
uh, red and a green bottom when the, when the business cycle is good, you push the green button and when the business cycle is bad, you put, push, uh, the red button. 
Uh, so much more flexibility than running blast furnaces that are typically built for being run 24 / 7 in 15 years or 20 years. And then, you do a re-lining 
or coke oven batteries that you run 24 / 7 in 30 to 50 years without flexibility. 
We will also have a better raw material for, uh, flexibility. We can use both fossil-free HPI from the partnership in HYBRIT 
and we can also use recycled scrap from internal operations and customers scrap that we are typically today selling on the market. 
And then, of course, we will be able to reduce or any avoid, avoid reinvestments in existing coal based operation. And as you might know, 
many of our, uh, operations were originally built during the '60s and the '70s. 
So we will have a modern mills, state-of-the-art mills with much lower CapEx needs. 
We expect this when we move now and start the feasibility study to cost around 45 billion for the coming 8 to 10 years, 
uh, and that includes Lulea, Raahe, Borlange, and Hameenlinna, but it is excluding the conversion in Oxelosund that costs 5 billion on top of it, this. 
And if we look at the investment plan up until 2045, 
I would say that this is similar or even lower 
than the existing plan to keep, uh, uh, ma- ma-maintenance of, of the assets we have today and moving into, to electric arc furnaces. 
So we will have a much more strategic and future oriented investments in this case. 
And we, when we look forward, we see that we have the ability to fund this transition with our own cash flow. 
And, uh, when we look at, uh, and we will come back with updates when we do the FIDs and so on, but when we look at the overall calculation this is a very interesting investment case, 
but we can't do this only by ourselves. We need help with some things from the society. 
Of course, we need environmental permits and have an efficient environment, uh, permit process 
that is maybe a little bit less worrying. What is important though is that we have fossil-free electricity at the right time, 
uh, at the right place. 
So, so we need to work with electricity transmission and make sure together with society that we can deliver that together on time, but if we can do that, 
we have a very good opportunity, uh, to be fossil-free 2030 in line with the growing market demand. 
So the way forward, we have initiated the feasibility study for Lulea and Raahe. 
We will start immediately the permit process, uh, already now 
and we will come back within information about sequencing and, uh, in financial guidance to when it is available. So we will keep you updated as we move on with this, uh, project. 
Then, outlook and summary for the year. 
When we look into Q1, we continue to see healthy demand in many sectors and many areas, 
uh, and especially for Q&T and advanced high strength steel. We see, foresee a solid demand in Q1. 
There is always, of course, 
uh, in Q1 as it was in 2021, in Q4, 
uh, questions regarding transport capacity and also the development of the COVID-19 situation, 
but right now it's not worse than it was in Q4 so, and hopefully this will ease up during 2022. 
So when we guide and look at shipments and prices, we expect higher shipments in special steels, Europe and Americas in Q1 versus Q4. 
Stable prices in special steels, somewhat lower prices in Europe and stable to somewhat higher prices in Americas. 
And as Leena said generally higher raw material costs and fuels and bottlenecks within transportation will continue in Q1. 
So we sum it up, before we open up for questions. 
Strong earnings, strong cash flow generation, high and stable production, good work with continuous improvement what we internally call SSAB-1, 
better safety performance and a debt-free situation with the net cash position end of 2021. 
The board is proposing a dividend of 5 kroner and 25 euro per share. 
And we have a plan for an accelerated Nordic transformation that, that will meet customer demand. 
And for fossil-free products within our segments, 
we are doing a step change, we're planning for step change when it comes to efficiency, flexibility, and co- and cost position 
and we will be able to eliminate, uh, carbon dioxide emissions 15 years earlier than the previous plan. 
So with that, uh, I think we open up for, and Leena, we open up for questions. 
Yes. Uh, we will do. Just, just a few words. 
Uh, we have good time now for questions, but I'm sure there's a lot of questions. So maybe in the first round, keep it to a couple of questions 
and as always please state them one at a time to make the, the process a bit easier here. 
So by that and I would please ask the operator to present instructions. Thank you. 
If you wish to ask a question, please dial 01 on your telephone keypads now to enter the queue. Once your name is announced you can ask your question. 
If you find it's answered before it's your turn to speak, you can dial 0-2 to cancel. 
Our first question comes from the line of Alain Gabriel at Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I, I have two questions. I'll start with them one at a time. 
Uh, firstly, on the budget for your green state transition. 
Uh, how much do you expect to obtain in funding from the Swedish or EU government knowing that Oxelosund was the only site to have received the EU innovation fund backing 
back in November last year, 
uh, given that your <inaudible> are also expecting almost 50% funding for their projects? 
How much do you expect <crosstalk>? Ah, we, ah, we, we, in our calculations we have done that, this with own cash flow, and then if we would get some funding, we haven't calculated with that. 
So, so, uh, the 45, 45 billion is what we believe it would, uh, cost maximum and, uh, we see that we can do this with our own cash flow generation. 
Okay. Thank you. And the second question is what would be the maximum CapEx that you're willing to tolerate in any given year, uh, from now until, until the end of the project? 
And what does that mean for your capital returns strategy and your dividend, um, say for example in 2022? 
We will not, uh, change the dividend policy. We were, we, and the proposal for 2021 is in line with, uh, the dividend policy. We will not change that. 
I think, uh, we are in a position with the net cash 
position, uh, when I look forward and look at, uh, demand development, cost development and so on. We, you should expect us to continue to generate, 
I've been saying this for many years now, <laugh> but you should expect us to continue to generate strong free cash flow. 
And then, we will, uh, use that, and of course this is, uh, money belonging to the shareholders. We will use that, uh, to invest and also to pay dividends. 
And in terms of max- your maximum CapEx tolerance 
per annum? No, but that will, of course, change over the years and, and I mean now we start the feasibility study and we are running, uh, the Oxelosund project so, so, 
I mean, uh, it, it will be a bit, uh, call it back end loaded the, the, the rest of it. So, so and we will have possibilities to adjust that over time as well. 
We don't have an, uh, uh, one figure saying that this is the maximum, 
uh, investment level we will have, but what we know is that we, instead of investing in old equipment we will invest in, in brand new equipment. 
Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Zhang of Barclays. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Yes, morning. Thanks for taking our questions, um, also to take them one by one. 
The first question. I was wondering if, um, you could help us understand what sort of the net CapEx is, because clearly you're 
avoiding, as you mentioned coking battery, um, CapEx, some other CapEx that you would have needed if you kept blast furnaces, 
I was wondering if you had a number on effectively what the net CapEx, uh, expenditure is over the next 10 years if you deducted those costs? 
But if you take them, uh, as I try to show out, 
I mean what we see running the existing operations, uh, for the period I showed on the slide 
will cost slightly more. And to give you some examples. The re-lining of the blast furnace is roughly one and, 
uh, one to one and a half, around one and a half billion. 
Uh, building a newer, re-aligning a coke oven battery is much more expensive than that. And then, we have, uh, steel shops and a lot of other things. So I would say 
this is compared to the previous plan a bit more front loaded, but, but the absolute terms are actually slightly lower. 
Okay. Fair enough. And, um, second question just on 
US plate pricing. I'm wondering if you're feeling any pressure there given plate looks to have overshot 
HRC quite materially now? Do you think there are any sort of risk that normalizes or do you think this kind of plate HRC spread could, um, an elevated spread could be maintained 
given sort of infrastructure demand? 
Very good question, but I would say that what we saw regarding the spread of HRC and plate last year was abnormal with HRC being much higher than plate. 
What we see now is more a historical pattern. 
Will that, uh, stabilize and be there forever? I don't really know, but we 
see a good underlying demand for plate in North America, and especially for, for infrastructure purposes and others, 
but where the spread will go, I was surprised to see the negative spread, uh, last year to be honest. Um, okay. Yes. That makes sense. 
I think this spread now, at least, from the numbers that I see are quite a bit above historic normalized, um, but, but it sort of feels like, yeah, and the market demand is there to 
certainly stop it going negative again. 
Um, okay. Those are my questions. Thanks very much. Cheers. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld of Exane BNP Paribas. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Good morning. Um, thanks for taking our questions. I too, I'll take one by one first on decarbonization and second on special steels. 
Uh, with regards to the decarbonization strategy, can you just give a bit more color on the raw materials plan, 
uh, you know, flexibility between scrap and HBI, but from the HBI side, you're reliant on HYBRIT. 
Uh, can you walk us through the plans for expansion of the HYBRIT, uh, green HBI capacity 
and what the additional CapEx implications would be for your contribution? I'll start there, please. 
Uh, what we have, what we are planning for right now is the what we call the demonstration 
plan, which is a full-scale production plant of 1.35 million tons, 
and we have announced that that will be built by the partners up in, in, in <inaudible> in Northern Sweden. 
Then, of course, we are discussing other plans also to, to step up these investments and LKAB is doing that. 
So we are doing this in a joint venture and, and a partnership so, so this fits, uh, uh, together with, with the plans for the value chain. 
So our ambition is to build a fossil-free value chain 
and have fossil-free steel available from that fossil-free value chain, uh, uh, for our customers. 
And that will of course be dependent on the, on the future demand, 
but, uh, what we see right now is that, uh, the demand is stronger than we thought and in the partnerships we have signed the ambitions are, uh, quite strong. 
So, so we have a good, 
uh, quality, good, good prospects for the future in that aspect. Then, of course, we need, of course, uh, power supply in order to, to do this transformation. 
The power generation is there and, and the power generation is being built out but we also need a, a power supply so that I would say will be time-wise maybe 
a, a limiting factor. 
Okay. Just to follow up on that. If by 2030, you're using exclusively green inputs, 
how much HBI do you expect to be consuming compared to about 1.3 million tons currently under development? Yeah. 
Of course, much more. Yes. 
Uh, we haven't said… I mean we are moving now into the feasibility stu- study and we, we can flex between, uh, 
HBI scrap and, and, and recycle the, the virgin scrap so to say. 
So, so I said we, we are not using the scrap today. 
We can get scrap back from customers and, and use internal scraps. So, so the exact balance we need to come back to. 
Okay. Thank you. Um, and I guess one last question, please, on special steals. Uh, can you just talk us through the medium-term outlook for price realizations? 
This is a business that historically has been a lot less volatile than the Americas or Europe businesses, 
um, with some price pressure being realized today in the spot market, how do you think about special steels going forward? 
If, if we take a step back and look at the EBIT margins that I showed on the first, uh, one of the first, uh, pictures, you saw that, uh, 
Europe and Americas had better and higher EBIT margins than special steels, which is typically the case in a very strong market. 
Uh, so, so you're right. Special steels is, uh, they are much more stable, uh, margin wise and price wise, less fluctuations and, and less volatility. 
What we see and what we saw during 2021 is structurally increasing underlying demand and we have seen that for, for quite some time 
and, and that is the important part. 
So they will continue to grow and I, I would bet you that we will meet the strategic target of 1.6 at the latest, uh, 2023. 
So, so we are following the planner. We are actually a bit ahead of plan, 
uh, but less volatility and more stable, uh, margins all the time. 
But the underlying demand is structurally growing. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Spence of Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Uh, yeah. Thanks, guys. Um, similarly two questions, take one, one time. The first one on, on decomposition. Um, how long do you anticipate the feasibility study to take? 
And what is your assumption around through cycle profitability that allows you to finance a lot of cash flow? Uh, 
I must apologize, uh- The first question was on, the first question was on how long before we can see the feasibility study? 
We have started a feasibility study and we will, uh, gradually get more and more educated. But I would say maybe one and a half, two years, maximum. Okay. 
And the second part of that one was, what is your assumption around through cycle profitability so that you can finance the CapEx out of cash flow? 
Uh, when we look at, uh, the long-term profitability and cash flow generation including these investments, we see that we can finance this over this period. 
Uh, that's our base assumption. 
Then, of course, uh, when you do projects like this you, in Swedish, we say, <unk>. You, you 
need to be really sure about that and we are very confident that we can do that. 
Okay. Thanks. Uh, the second one on Europe, um, in 2021, you achieve your, um, tonnage target for premium volumes. 
What's, what's kind of an upside target for, for ' 23 or where do you see that going? Oh, 
I see we have 
a, a lot to do on that target and especially within automotive where the demand has been affected by shortage of semiconductors. 
We have excellent products and some products they're high, 
uh, the martensitic steels up to 2000 mega pascal, which where we are world unique. We, we know the platforms. 
We 
have, 
uh, are, uh, we are, or we're into and so on. So, so I, I see a lot of growth prospects for, for the, uh, automotive part as one example. 
And we have also invested in Borlange in the continuous <inaudible> line, 
uh, to take up the capacity. So, so we have, 
uh, we have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow that, uh, premium mix above the target of 2023. 
Thank you, and just if I have one last one, just quick confirmation. 
Um, if the feasibility studies take one and a half to two years, can that, can you just confirm that there'll be no CapEx spent on those projects until those studies are done? 
No. Then, but there will be some costs. I mean with, with consultants internal work and so on. 
So, so, uh, but, uh, to be honest, I'm not sure it will take… I, 
I don't have the exact, uh, days and months it would take the feasibility study, but, uh, fair guess from the top of my head would be one and a half to two years. 
And then, we know the cap. And then, we will take the decisions, uh, mill by mill so to say. Okay. 
Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Luke Nelson at JP Morgan. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Hi. Thanks for taking, uh, my questions. 
It's two for me. Tell them one by one. Firstly, again, just on, on decarburization, 
um, maybe just more around the funding side of things, 
uh, and follow on from the prior question that 
sounds like CapEx is, is probably going to ramp up in a year or two time. So 2022, 
um, will sort of still be a CapEx light year from, from that side of things. I, 
I suppose in that context, it's, 
it's likely gonna be a, see a significant increase, again, in terms of balance sheet strength and the net cash position. 
Um, how should we be thinking about that surplus capital over, over the very short term? 
Is it likely that it's, it's sort of going to be kept more as a war chest, um, in advance of that CapEx spend, 
um, or is there still an ability to maybe return, um, surplus capital back to shareholders in, uh, the, the new term? I'll start with that. Uh, 
I think we, we have a clear dividend policy and we will 
follow that dividend policy and we are obviously in a different position right now with the net cash position and as I said, uh, 
I've said it many times and I have a tendency of repeating myself on that issue, 
but, but you should expect us to continue to generate from operations, uh, strong cash flow and, and have a good cash flow generation 
and we are not done, even though 
I think, uh, Leena was rightly so impressed with the development of net operating working capital over sales, 
we actually had a lot of inventories at the end of the year, because, due to transport pro- uh, product problems and so on. So, uh, 
I think we will have a solid, uh, cash flow generation for the coming years and for the future. And then, we will use that cash flow wisely. 
Uh, as I said it belongs to the shareholders. We will, uh, live by the dividend policy and we will do investments that we believe is, 
uh, good investments for the future. So it will be a combination. 
Thank you. Uh, second question is it's more just on the CapEx figure itself. 
Um, can you maybe, uh, clearly there's subject share a feasibility study, uh, and confirmation of that. 
But maybe can you just talk about to what extent there's contingencies built in within that figure from things like cost inflation, uh, and overrun, um? 
And then, maybe just in terms of how much 
of the, that, that budget is fixed versus still subject to change and maybe assumptions around 
it, things like that <crosstalk>? Of, of, of, of course, of course we have done our homework and done our calculations 
and, and we are of course not willing to put ourselves in a situation where we would over exceed, exceed that, uh, call it the round and rough figures. 
So that there are continuous built into that number. Yes. 
Okay. Great. I'll leave it there and now I'll jump back in. Thank you. And let's come back, let's come back to the issue when we have the FIDs and the investment cases ready. And then, we can talk about profitability, internal rate of return and so on. 
Okay. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian <inaudible> of Citigroup. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Um, hi. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions have already been asked, but a follow-up on, on CapEx. 
So I mean with the Nordic system plan in place, 
we can see four large bucket of the CapEx, which is sustaining CapEx, uh, contribution to the HYBRIT, uh, development, obsolescence, conversion CapEx, and then on top of that Nordic system CapEx. 
So is that a fair way of looking at, at your CapEx pipeline for the next 10 years? 
And then, 
can you help us, uh, you know, estimate the CapEx for beyond 2022, um, in terms of all these four buckets 
what should we think about, kind of a, you know, incremental CapEx in 2023, ' 24, ' 25, um, in these four buckets? 
No, but I, what we are saying is that the transformation of the building of two modern high efficient mini-mills in, in the Nordic production system including investments in Borlange and 
Hameenlinna and some other that will cost 
roughly 45 billion. 
We have also said that the conversion of Oxelosund will cost roughly 5 billion. 
So these are the two main buckets. Uh, Oxelosund will, uh, uh, as communicated earlier, be up and running already 2026, but 
then also when, you know, that, 
uh, we are not going to run the existing facilities with the blast furnaces and coke oven batteries and so on, 
uh, for the, for the long-term future there 
will also be a bucket of CapEx avoidance in existing facilities. 
I mean right now, we are up, until now, we have been running them as going concerned, meaning that they would run forever. So you have, 
you have a bucket, bucket of CapEx avoidance as well. And then, how that plays out every year and so on is a, a bit too early to say. 
But, uh, in the 45 billion, we have contingencies and we will come back to call it, uh, FIDs for, for, for each, 
uh, investment. This is a directional decision and this is the starting point of, 
of a vision and an idea of, of speeding up the transformation of the Nordic strip system 
where we have done a lot of homework, of course. 
Sure. Sure. Um, thanks a lot. 
Um, and then, a quick shorter term question on working capital. So you've already invested close to 6 billion in working capital in 2021. 
What should be kind of from a modeling perspective, what should we thinking in terms of working capital in, in Q1, 
uh, at least from a direction point of view? 
You will, of course, be dependent, uh, on the market, but you should not expect us to massively invest in working capital. 
Quite the opposite. 
Okay. Okay. Thanks <inaudible> 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of <inaudible> at Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Thank you very much. Uh, two questions from my side. The first one is on the current order backlog in Europe and North America. 
Do you see any change in patterns, uh, currently, probably for second quarter 
given the high seed prices still in your order book? 
Um, means is there any standoff or do you think, um, the good order intake will also continue into the second quarter so the first half is pretty much, 
um, I believe done? That's the first one. 
<laugh> And, and typically <inaudible> for the coming quarter and the order book for Q1 gives us, uh, the courage to, to give the guidance we have. 
Uh, then, I said create this question mark, 
uh, the transportation system is a question mark, but the order book gives us, uh, clarity in Q1. 
Am I expecting, uh, the work to break down first of April? It doesn't look like that right now. 
No, and can I add also, Martin? Okay. We, we believe that these shortages will probably ease during the first half. 
Yeah. At least, at least, that's, that's our base scenario. Then, as I said we don't know but, 
yeah. Okay. Perfect. That helps already. This second question I have is also on the CapEx for 2022. 
Um, you mentioned around 5 billion, 
at the same time we see that your targets for SSAB services, for example, to achieve 4.5 billion in sales, 
um, and out of it one and a half billion through acquisition is still on, 
so, um, ideally you need to actually, um, execute on this within the next 24 months. 
Um, is this 5 billion CapEx number including any ex- at least, any acquisition CapEx? Yes. Is it already included? Yes. Okay. And, and 
I was, I was partly, partly wrong during my presentation, because we actually did some acquisition with S- within SSAB services during 2021 as well. 
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I just want to clarify that. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of <inaudible>. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Uh, yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. 
Uh, maybe let, let me get back to the, um, to this decarburization plan which I guess is pretty impressive, uh, for the rest of the industry. 
Um, when you talk about the motives to advance that much, uh, I, 
I take the point on, on the demand, but I guess with the longer term perspective, this is probably what you expected anyway that the green steel is becoming 
what the, uh, the main product the market is demanding for. 
Are there any other points why this is being accelerated that much? Uh, looking at Oxelosund, you have been discussing these issues with infrastructure and permitting 
and the power cables and so on for quite some time, so what is giving you the confidence from that background that you can move that much faster than, than previously anticipated? 
I think, uh, I think it is a bit less complicated up in Northern Sweden and Northern Finland, uh, uh, for one reason. 
We have learned a lot as well during this process, but, but the underlying factor is, uh, the increased demand. 
And when we started this project together with LKAB and Vattenfall, we were not really foreseeing how the demand would, uh, develop. And 
I think also we have a unique position here up in the Nordics, because we have surplus of fossil-free electricity. 
We have the right iron ore. We have the knowledge and we have 
now also proven that we can produce this steel. And, and that is 
a, a good, uh, have been asked for by the market and has been creating a lot of interest in the market. 
I also think that, 
uh, we have with, with us pre- prerequisites the possibility to, to bring and start to, to bring mini-mills to Europe, which has not been the case before 
and we have experience since 20 years of running mini-mills and you see the development in North America now with quite, uh, 
I mean take Steel Dynamics in Sinton as an example, quite impressive being built with, with capacity and cost position and capabilities that fits us very well 
and we see the possibility to broaden our product offering. One example was to meet the why the Q&T with thin gauges that is asked for by the market, 
but where we don't have the ability to produce today with, with good cost efficiency and productivity. 
So it's a lot of reasons, but, but it starts with the, the increasing demand from the market and the marketplace 
and if you should do this anywhere in Europe, I think you should do it in, 
in, in Northern Sweden and Northern Finland. Okay. 
I think that's a fair point. And, and Martin, maybe can, can we come back to the CapEx figure? 
Um, maybe I will, I'm not 100% sure that I got it right. 
Is the, 
um, is 
the, um, the plan including any incremental DRI investments or would be the base case that this could be done by LKAB? 
And is this, 
um, are you having now a different stance on the, 
um, um, on the, um, you know, on the, um, whether you want to be 
part of this or do you want to have that outside of your core com- competencies? 
Is this change, is this acceleration now changing your stance on whether what is your core business and, and what is outside of your core? 
Uh, no. It hasn't and we haven't to be honest really decided. What is important for us is the partnership with LKAB and Vattenfall and the ambition or, or the, 
uh, yeah, the ambition to create the fossil-free value chain and to optimize that value chain. 
And then, how we will invest or, or not in that? We, we, we need to figure out over time, but we have been investing in the pilot plant and we are now in the HYBRIT, 
uh, in the final stages of, of the FID with the demonstration plant. 
So is DRI included in the 45 billion? Uh, the 45 billion is, uh, what is currently the Nordic pr- uh, strip system. 
So the, the answer is simple and the answer is no. Okay. 
And finally, on the ramp up of the, um, this, this, uh, green steel shipment, fossil-free ship, steel shipments. 
Um, you're saying that you want to have the, uh, the, the commercial, um, <inaudible>, uh, already from the very start, 
so is this, are you seeing a fair chance that the mill can deliver the full volumes from the very beginning or shall we expect there's a multi-year ramp up? 
There, there is always on investment ramp-ups. The good thing with this is so that we can build the mills in parallel with the existing mills. 
And then, when the, uh, new mills are ramped up, we close the existing mills 
and we can do that before the next blast furnace re-aligning or before we need to spend a lot of money in coke oven batteries and others. 
So, so from a risk perspective, I think this, uh, is also a way of mitigating risks. 
So we will not <crosstalk>- Okay. put, put any customers in, in, in jeopardy. Okay. 
Maybe, uh, maybe I was unclear. Uh, what I meant is on the, uh, on the demonstration plant is, uh, first, 1.3 million tons of fossil-free steel, what 
kind of timeline do you think do, do you need to fully push and establish that terms in the market? 
Is this just a, a one-year process or is this rather a multi-year ramp-up phase? 
No. We are getting more and more sure that we will be able to deliver volumes from that plant to Oxelosund 2026. 
Okay. Okay. That's clear. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Mann at Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Good day, guys. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question. 
Um, it's a bit of a follow-up question just on the possible funding for this and, uh, apologies if I misunderstood the answer 
or, but I understood that at the moment you're planning for the said 45 to be funded internally from cash flows and you're confident that you can generate that. Yes. 
I mean is, is there not government funding or government support or European, uh, funds or even low-cost financing available that can help offset some of this CapEx pull and will you be looking into that 
or is it the case that you've looked at it and decided to do it yourself? 
No. But, uh, of course, uh, there could be possibilities like that, but that we have not taken that into account when we have done our calculations, 
but we, we see a lot of interest of, of funding these kind of projects, 
but I said when we look at the future we see that we have the ability to fund this with our own cash flow, and, and then, how we finally finance it, we, 
we, uh, let's take that decision when we, we come to the investment, uh, decisions. 
And as you saw last year, we already then had this sustainability linked bond 
where we had good conditions on the back of, back of the earlier plan. Now, this is much more aggressive so we will not be in a worse position on that as well. 
But I think the starting position is de- decent with the net cash positions 
and, and, uh, good cash flow generation prospects. So, so I think, uh, yeah. 
Thanks. 
I, I think the reason there's so many questions on this is because your peers say, you know, they're expecting up to 50% percent of, of government support, right? So I think that's where, where that's all coming from. Yeah. 
I mean, and then, maybe just one follow up, 
um- But, but, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Uh, please go ahead. I'm sorry, Martin. I didn't meant to interrupt you. Uh, no, I was, uh, trying to think out loud and that is not always a good idea. So please, continue. 
<laugh> <laugh> Um, the, the other, uh, the second question I just wanted to ask that, you know, you did speak a little bit about how this could be positive for margins in terms of, 
um, you know, the different grades and qualities of steel that you're able to output. 
Can you maybe just help us think through the economics, the unit economics of this a little bit more? So should we be thinking about this as higher cost, 
um, steel although you avoid CO2, but at the end of the day you're getting a premium or, or a higher price on average, a higher realized price? 
I think, yeah, what, what- Um, is that the way to think about it? 
The way we have looked at this is that we will have a much more cost efficient production with a broader product portfolio. 
And then, of course, as you mentioned some future cost avoidance. 
Uh, that is how we have done the calculations. 
I think there will be most probably a premium 
to start with and, uh, on, on fossil-free, but I think and hope that fossil-free will be the new normal, 
and because customers and consumers are demanding that. 
So, so over time, I think this will be a very cost efficient, effective way of producing fossil-free steel products within our niches and our segments. Understood. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Victor <inaudible> of Danske Bank. Please, go ahead. Your online is open. 
Yes. Uh, thank you, operator, and good morning Martin and Leena. 
Good morning. Good morning. Um, just, just, just firstly, could you, uh, please remind us on maintenance CapEx needs for the coming of, so 5, 10 ten years? 
Uh, at what level is, is that? Well, 
I think in, 
and, and they, they have had fairly the last couple of years fairly normal maintenance CapEx levels or if I remember it correctly after around, uh, a couple of billions. Yeah. Uh, uh, 
1.8 to 2 billions expense so. 
And that, of course, we see the possibility to gradually, then, uh, uh, decrease, uh, when we are 
not, when we know that we will not, uh, run the existing 
system forever. 
So, so it will be, uh, uh, call it a gradual, uh, gradually lower and lower. 
Okay. No. That's, uh, that's brilliant. I, I just think, you know, something quite strong methods in terms of, 
of cash flows, uh, I suppose or talking about <inaudible> CapEx of let's say of 5.5 billion per year in the coming 10 years. 
That's a maintenance CapEx of 1.6, uh, 
you know, you have a historically generic the first 3 billion in free cash flow over a cycle that would imply 10 billion in operating cash flows for the coming 10 years, 
you know, what, what, what's behind that? Is that, you know, more healthy steel market or- 
I think, uh, I think it's a combination if you look right now and compared to a number of years ago, I think that the steel market is more in balance. 
I think also with this, uh, fit for 55 in Europe 
there will be no possibilities for, for steel companies to hunt volumes, because they will have to pay emission rights. 
I think structurally maybe 
healthier from an output point of view and demand and supply balance, a healthier, uh, 
market, but we are also looking into our ability to continue to shift the mix to less volatile products more, more profit generating products. 
Then, of course, we will still have volatility, but the ambition is to reduce the volatility as much as possible 
and that is done with a couple of things. 
Of course, the most important part shifting the mix towards more stable price, stable, and more stable products. 
Continue to work with the continuous improvements in order to increase productivity, reduce cost, and reduce lead times. 
And, and so, we have a number of programs that we are running and I think, uh, that, uh, when we look at that, we see that and do the calculations including continuous and, and so on. 
Uh, we see that this is clearly a good opportunity and possibility for the future. 
Yeah. Uh, no. Brilliant, uh, yeah, you know, strong, strong message. Obviously, I guess that, you know, implies normalized earnings of less than 12 billion. 
Um, so, uh, strong message <crosstalk>- 20- 20- 
2021 was obviously 
a very good year. <laugh> You shouldn't expect us to, uh, generate more than 12 billion in free cash flow every year, but I've been with… Like a fool repeating myself that 
we should be able to continue to generate strong cash flow and we are not ready. 
I mean, yes, we were investing a lot in, in working capital towards the end of the year. Yes. For sure. 
We'll continue to do that. No. We still, still see, see opportunities to become more capital efficient. 
And the example with the, with the mini-mills if you reduce lead times from just a simple calculation from eight weeks to less than two weeks, 
that is also a huge possibility of releasing working capital. 
Yeah. That's, uh, that's, then, just a question in terms of your Q1 guide, uh, more short, uh, short term. 
Um, just, you know, to be clear, 
what you're saying is that 
cost 
could come up a bit, prices basically flat, and then you have no maintenance in, in Q1. So I suppose, you know, mixing that together Q1 earnings should be higher than Q4, is, is that correct? We, we don't give any figures or guidance. That's, uh, your job to, to figure out. 
<laugh> No, but we are also saying that we, we see, 
we see, uh, problems in the supply chain. 
We had, uh, end of Q4 and we still have problems with, uh, getting lor- trucks, uh, getting containers, rail ship, rail shipments, uh, boats and so on. 
We don't know where the COVID situation will end up and when it will end. We have had problems in Q4. We still have problems with a lot of people 
with a, a high short term lead. The people being in qua- quarantine being sick or taking care of sick, uh, family members. 
So, so 
it's too early to say. There are still, uh, some, um, 
uh, call it, uh, problems, uh, like we had in Q4. And, and they persist into Q1 so far. 
and remember, remember, remember, Victor, also the prices in Europe will be lower also 
so. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's, that's clear. And, and just a final very quick, uh, quick question just in terms of returns on the CapEx program. You mentioned 7 billion in avoided as a two costs. So 
I guess you no, no incremental- 
That, that, that was one example, but when we look at the calculation and we need… I said we need to come back to that when we come with the FIDs, but 
we see this as a very interesting investment opportunity when we look at the calculations so far, 
otherwise we wouldn't, uh, propose it. 
But let's come back to that with more details. Yeah. No. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. 
Thank you very much, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of <inaudible> for CNB markets. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Yes. Hi, everyone. It's <inaudible> here. Um, yeah. 
I have a question on, on, well, what you showed on basically slide 18 in your slide package about 
premiums on the first green steel that you're aiming for I think 2026 or so. 
Could you elaborate a bit on, on how you see the price premium series? It's sort of one premium from everyone buying fossil-free steel or is it sort of different case by case? And if you, 
I would so much appreciate if you could give us any sort of help in the magnitude of, of future price premium that you're, you're projecting. That's my question. 
No. Not really. I mean, uh, we, we think, um, the, the market is very interested. The market is wheeling from start to pay a premium. 
I honestly believe that, uh, well, there will be might be a price difference between, 
uh, <laugh> carbon-free, fossil-free steel and, and usual steel 
where margin difference or, or however you put it, 
but, but I think, uh, and hope that this will be the new normal. 
So, so I think it's very hard to say what, what will the premium be over time and how do you calculate the premium. So let's come back to that. I don't have a good answer. Yeah. But we see that, 
uh, the current demand, uh, is, uh, exceeding, uh, the planned capacity. 
And my, our base case guess, and I would say that this is a fairly educated guess is that, that demand will not lower over time, 
and you have seen announcements from companies like Daimler what, what kind of, 
of pressure they put on their sub suppliers when it comes to scope 3 emissions, 
and my guess would be and I, I would say, claim that this is an educated guess as well, is that, that pressure will not decrease. I would say quite the opposite. 
But that's helpful anyway. 
Uh, and I would also wondering- So, so, so what I, what I see and what I'm trying to say, honestly, is that 
I see an opportunity, because the location and the knowledge and, and, and, and the partnership we have within HYBRIT and with customers 
makes this, uh, I mean if you should do this, you should do it in Northern Sweden and Northern Finland. 
Yeah. Yeah. Got you. 
I can, I mean everybody assumes I suppose that the premium will be highest in, in the first years when this is a revolutionary product- Yes. uh, let's see if it becomes a new normal or not. 
Then, then, I have a question also, you mentioned a few times in the presentation margin about that scrap availability seems to be pretty good for you in the Nordics. 
I mean would it be possible to run the new SSAB set up with, with these sort of scrap in the Nordics? 
And is it enough scrap basically that you can be, be using locally 
or how do you see that? 
Uh, we, we could, we could potentially do that, yes. Uh, run it on scrap as we do in US and there is scrap availability in the Nordics and we are one big producer of scrap <laugh> and our customers 
using our material. 
So then, we could also use it, uh, with scrap from the market today. We are selling scrap to the market. 
Uh, so, so there is a possibility and that's what we try to call flexibility then between HBI and, and scrap. So we will, in practice, have, 
uh, higher flexibility than raw material flexibility today, than today. Okay. Got you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of <inaudible> of Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. Uh, yeah. Good morning and also thanks for taking my questions. I've got only two quick ones left. So 
I'll also take them one at a time. Um, 
Martin, could you briefly talk about the new product segments, which you aim to enter, please? 
We have, uh, a fairly good idea about that and it is within the mobility sector. And one good example and I won't bore you with too many examples, 
but one good example is to meet the wide Q&T which is, 
uh, and thin gauges, which, which is asked for by the market and we are not in a cost efficient way able to produce that today. 
I mean the quarter mill in Oxelosund is, uh, not, uh, an optimal setup to produce, uh, 
I would say thinner gauges than four millimeters, and, and with these mills we can produce one, two, three up to four millimeters. 
Uh, so, so we will have a broader product offering. We will also with this mill what we are lacking today and what is asked for is, uh, and where we have a fairly 
low market share is galvanized products, 
uh, especially within advanced high-strength steels. We don't have the capacity today. 
That will be another example. 
So and with that, I guess you're really entering a new product spectrum in that sense that you're basically entering the surface market in automotive, right? 
Not necessarily. No. 
Uh, but, but we are focused to stay within our niches with advanced high-strength steels and, and Q&T and there we see possibilities 
both for, for, as said with the example of Q&T, new grades and new gauges and widths, 
but, but also, uh, other parts where we are either <inaudible> producing today like galvanized advanced high strength steels or not being able to produce at all. 
Okay. And then, just to briefly explore 
<crosstalk>- So, so, so just to be, just to be clear. 
I mean we're not changing the strategy or the focus on, on niche products. That's still the foundation that will continue to be the foundation of SSAB. Yeah. No. 
I think that's very clear that you're pursuing that. 
Um, but just to explore briefly further, you, you mentioned strong demand and I guess we all were able to see 
a very strong demand from automotive, I guess those are, this is the segment which you are emphasizing, at the same time, obviously, at the moment automotive 
I would say relative to other C companies is under- underrepresented in your end market. 
Um, are you seeing that pool for fossil-free steel from other end market segments as well such as white goods 
or what- whatever? Yes. We see that from a lot of segments and segments that we are not active in today and segments that we will, where we will not be 
active, but we see it from heavy transport. We see it from other segments where we are active today. So I would say, 
<laugh> to 
be honest, we see it from most of the segments, uh, want to have fossil-free steel in the future 
with very few exceptions. 
Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Martin. And, and then, I have one follow-up question on CapEx. I'm sorry to come back on, on that, obviously, there have been a lot of questions around that already. 
Leena, uh, you were showing some charts on CapEx, I think on slide 22, 
and I guess before, you've always been talking about three, three and a half billion CapEx over the cycle 
as the rough guidance. 
To keep things simple and instead of talking about the key peak CapEx or nailing things down, uh, to one specific year, which is, which I appreciate is very difficult to do. 
What would be the new normal effective over the cycle CapEx for the rest of the decade which we should be picturing? 
And again, I, I'm conscious that may be subject to change because if electricity isn't there, the 45 billion will obviously be split maybe over a longer time spend 
and maybe there will be some funding, but what is the broad number we can work with versus the three to three and a half before? 
It's, it's a very good question and let's come back to that, because as we said, 
I mean we have the maintenance CapEx level today that will over time then in existing facilities go down. We have the Oxelosund conversion, which we have said 
will cost, uh, until 2026 roughly 5 billion. 
And then, we have this new program. So it will be a combination of that 
and it will be dependent on when we start, but, but for the coming years, you should expect us to, 
uh, move on with Oxelosund, and then gradually then start to invest in our Nordic mills, but at the same time, 
we will start to reduce, uh, maintenance CapEx and call it other strategic CapEx in, in, in those facilities. 
So let's come back to that with, with, when we move on with this, uh, feasibility study and have more clarity. 
But we have said a round figure of 45 including contingencies and, and in order not to disappoint anyone with that figure. Okay. Okay. 
Sounds good. Okay. At least, I tried my best. <laugh> 
Thank you 
so much. 
<crosstalk> and you tried on Leena's first meeting to see if you could- Yeah. uh, convince her to answer something <laugh> that you knew that you wouldn't get an answer from <inaudible>. So good try. <laugh> Okay. Thanks so much, all of it. 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andy Jones at UBS. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. 
Hi. Thanks for the, uh, thanks for the opportunity. 
My question is regarding priorities, because I guess, you know, the very low power costs in Northern Sweden 
throughout a huge advantage for making low cost sponge iron 
and clearly, you're dedicating a huge amount of capital to, 
to, you know, EAX and, and basically sorting out the steel facilities, 
but it doesn't leave a huge amount to potentially invest in HYBRIT, uh, going forward. 
Can you just talk a bit more about how you see the, the returns on 
producing sponge iron, uh, given the economics, the power costs and so forth that you see now 
compared to, you know, the investments that you're making here, 
because obviously the majority of the CO2 reduction comes from the, uh, you know, there's sponge iron 
part and, you know, that seems to be where the value is? So I'm quite surprised that the magnitude of the spending here compared to the focus on HYBRIT, 
and are you giving up an opportunity potentially to, to LKAB, who might wish to, who seem to want to accelerate this? Are you, you know, essentially losing some of the value of your, 
your location? 
Um, that's, that's quite a poor question, 
but <laugh> <crosstalk>- But, but, but what I'm trying to explain is that we will do this in a partnership in the, in, in the HY- HYBRIT partnership together with LKAB and, and Vattenfall. And 
I think, uh, it will be dependent on, on electricity prices. 
I think the good thing with this product is that we will also have hydrogen storage. 
So we can use, uh, wind power as an example. And then, store energies in, 
in, in, in the hydrogen storage. And then, produce, 
uh, sponge iron 24 / 7 regardless of, of peaks or, or troughs in, in electricity prices. 
So what I'm trying to say and, and let's come back to that, 
but we're trying together to optimize then, uh, a value chain. And then, exactly who will do what then, who will own what, 
we haven't really decided, uh, 
that, uh, we have the partnership, we are now investing or planning to start to invest in the demonstration plant. And then, we'll take it from there. 
<crosstalk> So, so we're talking about the full value, value chain together with LKAB, SSAB, Vattenfall, and then customers. 
So what we are trying to achieve is fossil-free products out that end users in a cost efficient way. 
Yeah. That makes, that makes sense. I guess I'm, I'm kind of asking, can you really afford to commit much more in terms of capital to HYBRIT given these huge CapEx investments for your planning here? 
Uh, that will of course depend on cash regeneration and so on, 
but, uh, now we are taking this decision and, and directional decision and we'll take, uh, the decisions one by one. But, but it goes together because, uh, we are now investing in a fossil-free value chain. Okay. 
And I think that is what is appreciated by the market and what the market wants to see. Yeah. Market- And 
I think the, the, the feasibility of doing that is, 
uh, better in the region and, and then we are in, then in other regions and with the knowledge and experience, we have, 
we are very well suited for this and we have a strong belief that this is the future, 
not maybe the full future, but this is what the market is asking for. No. 
I completely agree. 
And just to clarify something on the 45 billion, 
obviously, the capital intensity is a lot higher than the Oxelosund one clearly, because the scope is larger. 
Aside from just building EAX, could you just give us an idea for what other facilities are included in that 45? <crosstalk> For example, 
<crosstalk> 
No. Uh, it's complete mini-mills, uh, like, uh, I think Sinton in, in Texas is a good example. 
Completed, completely integrated mill starting with electric arc furnaces outcomes, uh, finished products of the rolling. 
So this is a complete mini-mill. Yes. 
In Oxelosund, we are closing the coke oven battery and the blast furnaces and moving over to electric arc furnaces, but we keep, uh, the steel shop, the rolling mill, 
because they are state-of-the-art and very well fitted for those kind of products. This, 
I mean you should compare it with <inaudible> or Sinton. 
Okay. Okay. But, okay. That's fine. That's great. Thank you. 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld out of Exane BNP Paribas. Please, go ahead. Your line is over. Good morning. 
Just one follow-up question, please. Um, 
I appreciate your comments earlier on the improved efficiency of the new capacity, better product mix, lower fixed costs, et cetera. 
Um, but in the past you've given an explicit figure for the higher operating costs of green steel. I believe they were 30% to 40% above traditional technologies. 
As you go forward and kind of dive into this at a broader scale, what's your confidence in the like, for like operating cost component? Um, 
I recognize there might be some other, other mitigating positives, but how do you think about the cost of production? What's your assumption around, for example, cost of that DRI substrate? 
Thank you. 
No. But, uh, we have been, become more and more sure about the cost and the efficiency and so on, and, and that has not increased over time when we have become more and more sure. 
I'm sorry. The cost inflation, you're more 
<crosstalk>- No. But, but, but might not know about the, the cost of producing, uh, steel like this is, uh, has not increased when we have gotten more and more educated. I would say the opposite. Okay. 
Can you confirm an updated expectation for how much your operating costs will increase like for like with the new technology? 
Uh, they would not increase. 
Okay. So compared to prior guidance of an over 30% increase, the new guidance is no increase? 
Uh, let's come back to that, but it is not a 30% increase, for sure. Okay. 
I think that's something that the market definitely wants more color on recognizing how much capital is being allocated to the shift in technology. 
And, and we need to come back to that when we, uh, come up with the FIDs and so on and take it mill by mill, but, but the operating costs will be, 
we will, we will be much more cost efficient. Okay. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. And we have one further person in the queue. That's, uh, Alan Spence of Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. Uh, 
I appreciate the opportunity to ask a couple of follow up questions. 
Um, the 5 billion Oxelosund conversion CapEx, can you just confirm how much that will be done by the end of 2022? And then, how the remaining will be split 
' 23 to ' 25? I think for ' 22, it's around a billion. mm-hmm <affirmative>. A billion in 2022. 
That's the total amount for <crosstalk> Uh, for, for Oxelosund conversion. 
No. That's for the ' 22 year. Uh, for, for ' 22. 
And, and how much was spent in ' 21? I don't have the exact figure, but part of the cost is already occurred during, during ' 21. Yeah. Okay. 
And the second one is just on, um, the down, you know, the blast furnace re-aligns and new coke ovens for Lulea and Raahe, 
uh, were those scheduled to be done before 2030 or after 2030? 
I would say around 2030. Then, you can always flex, uh, sometimes you can prolong it a year and sometimes you need to do it a year earlier. So I would say around 2030 
the two blast furnaces in Raahe. One of them slightly later and also, and Lulea in that region as well. So I would say around 2030 all the three of them. 
Okay. So but effectively within the timeline of the 45 billion? Yes. Not afterwards? Is that the correct way to think about it? 
Um, around that timeline. Uh, I, 
I say that around 2030, because it's not an exact science. 
You, you can sometimes you're lucky and you can run a blast furnace one more year than planned. Sometimes you're unlucky, you need to do it one year earlier. 
It depends so much of, of the wear and tear in the, uh, blast furnaces 
and also if you have, uh, had to stop them or not. So, so it is not an exact science, but, 
but, uh, around 2030 all the three, all three of them. Okay. Thank you. 
So the idea is to avoid that, of course. 
Thank you. And, and so, there are no further questions on the line at this time. I'll hand back to our speakers for the closing comments. 
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for all the interest. And by that, we close today's conference call and we wish you a pleasant day. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
