Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Pilbara Minerals-December 2021, quarterly investor conference call and webcast. All participants are in listen only mode. 
There will be a presentation, followed by a question and answer session. 
If you wish to ask a question via the phone, you will need to press the star key, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. 
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Ken Brinsden, Managing Director and CEO. Please go ahead. 
Thank you Rachel and welcome to everybody joining on the call, 
and welcome to those joining via the webcast, officially those uh shareholders that are taking the time, um, joining us, much appreciate 
it! Uh, Here in the mineral set office uh, joined by dial independent operating officer and Broad 
Financial. You'll hear from during the call 
also in the Chief Commercial Officer general counsel and <unk> uh, that's the relation specialist. 
Thanks to everyone for joining. 
Um, well the backdrop to the quarterly call is while strong demands accelerating price 
and product inaudible to mineral to respond a little bit with some production challenges and evince inaudible during uh, the December quarter. Um, we've 
been continuing to work on the acceleration of Pilgangoora production and 
a very, very busy quarter. As we started production at the Ngungaju Plant um, i-just to remind you, the former Altura facilities. 
And we brought on the Pilgan plants improvements project, 
uh, which is complete, and now fully tied in, 
and we continue to ramp up the production at the Pilgan plant. 
Uh, in spite of all of that, a lot more side activity. 
And that includes um, relatively significant growth in mining, 
uh volumes which you can see, uh in production titles within the quarterly, 
um all be it still having to go higher as we support uh, production growth, both in the short and the medium term. 
And customers obviously want more products. 
Um, you can see that we respect the pricing process quite incredible. And that's something that I'll come back to talk to in-in more detail, during our commentary. 
Um, yeah! Incredible results on our BMX platform. Um, With respect to spot sale. 
Very, very strong pricing, especially in China, 
uh, which is just reminding everyone is the world's largest within raw 
materials market, and brilliant international markets with pricing hitting record highs, virtually every week. 
Uh, and that's translating very well to inaudible which-which is part of what… again, I'll explain in-in more detail. 
Um, the reference prior to that headline, y-you know the chemicals price, and how that's flowing to the value in the sponsor main, I'll go to explain a bit more detail. So th-so 
that you understand some of the dynamics in the market. 
Um, the inaudible production continues, albeit slower than we would like. 
Uh, just to remind everyone, we're taking Pilgangoora Production from approximately 330,000 spodumene concentrates um, 
per annum to 580,000 spodumene Concentrate production, 
uh, peak production growth, and we've a… had some challenges. Uh, 
But as always, the-the Pilbara Minerals team is working incredibly hard, and carrying some fantastic skills that we've learned over the years about how to bring that production on. 
Still targeting 590,000 spodumene concentrate times by, by… it's a run rate, by the middle of this year. 
However, both plants are feeling the ramp up phase, and it's that issue, 
combined with the effects of you know, difficulties in the labor market, and then more recently, community distribution of-of the COVID bar in Western Australia, that means there is boundaries to-to 
our ability to produce as-as hard and as fast as we would like. 
Um, but 
nonetheless, um, you know, a lot of work going on as I said, and the Pilbara Minerals team carried all the right skills to-to make it happen! And we're obviously doing the best that we can. 
Uh, the inaudible demonstrated joint venture… was executed during the quarter, 
um, and we're now going through the completion criteria for the final formation of the joint venture, 
um, in parallel. inaudible So started the early work, 
um, at the one yard site, and I confirmed that they'll, uh, with the significant construction work, 
um, during the current quarter. 
Uh, so we're looking forward to their progress over approximately the next two years. 
Um, as we head to the Pilbara minerals first Hydroxide production, uh in joint venture with Pasco. 
So, coming up, 
uh, Dan will explain a bit more about what we're up to in both production, and if we ramp up the plant, and also uh, production growth, to the median term. And uh, 
Brian will follow up with some more commentary about inaudible generation, and a little bit of a follow up to, uh… to the cost story. 
So, on that note, 
Dale over to you. Thanks Ken, and good morning, everyone. 
Um, all of-of my commentary on-on three parts. So basically a little bit about the operation. 
A quick touch on-on the reserve update that we did during the quarter, and then to finish, I'll provide some environment for the projects, uh space expansion plans, which we've got coming up. 
So the 
inaudible operations, as Ken described: uh, expanding growth quarter, uh, bringing on two operations, ramping them… starting to ramp those up, both simultaneously. 
Uh, so growth quarter, but we have definitely had some growing pains and convention. 
The labor shortages of our training uh, across the state 
of Dampier has not been immune to that, and we have found, um those times into-into our operation. 
That being said, the cause is fairly solid production, um, and 84,000 tons-at the low end of their guidance. 
Recovery: 62% average across uh, both operations. A-again slightly below where we wanted it to be. 
Excuse me, through the inaudible operation. 
From a mining perspective. It was a quarter of-of moving more waste, um that-that per the plan, but not quite the volumes we wanted to achieve. 
Again function of, upon the labor shortages, uh that um… and mining contractors, as seen. 
One of the consequences of this was-was slightly compromised or the or, in-in terms to the farm, 
which translated through to s-slightly lower recovery than we had planned, the consequences around mining movement. 
And part of the-the response to mining, during the quarter, Pilbara negated our own blind fleet, and-and mobilized own small owner operator fleet, uh, to support the inaudible operation, which principally serves the Ngungaju Plant. So, we-we keep that all, uh, during the quarter and pleased to report that that started well. 
Moving from mining and stepping into each of the processing plants. 
So with Pilgan processing 
um, for the quarter, uh, average of 65%, the same recovery. This is the planet at 35. As mentioned earlier, just slightly off where we wanted… where we wanted it to be. 
Uh, the improvement projects package, which is the D bottle necking project for that plot with construction complete, commissioned, and it, really just moving through a-an optimization phase, as we… as we look to ramp up and increase throughput… through-through that uh, operation. 
From a cost basis, uh, 
higher than we wanted to… where we want it to be, uh a consequence of increased mind movements, 
um, some minging contract performance challenges, that I mentioned, 
and in the plant space. Uh, the offering being slightly off where we wanted, and some delays around commissioning to provide a plant, including some extended shutdown. 
So um, and in summary, quite a few contributing factors playing through-through to a cost impact. 
And Brian will speak to those in a little bit more uh, detail, uh, later, and innovation. 
So moving from to Pilgan processing plant, and now, speaking to Ngungaju. Uh, 
the-the December quarter was the quarter where-where you had the ignition switch, uh, so to speak. pUh, first concentrate from the call circuit coming through, um, in early October. 
and that operation, we're moving it through a stage ramp up, c-calling circuit, float u-up to follow. Slow 
circuit, we're on track to-to effectively start that emissions which are for circuit. Um, and this quarter, 
so… inaudible uh, following w- what we wanted… what we wanted it to be, uh, some maintenance issues contributing to 
it, um, but all said and done: good to get the-the wheels turning, um, and production starting to flow for the operation. 
Last thing on the inaudible production guidance, uh inaudible given 
the labor challenges, and some of the ramp up challenges we've had… 
our… we're commencing a review, and we'll look to revise their guidance, uh, to have early results, when they come out to course. 
So that completes so the update. Uh, moving to Barcelona reserve just a-a note there, that 
during the quarter, uh, we did do a significant reserve upgrade, so this is a combination of-of bringing in the Altura, 
our reserve and resource and-and to inaudible minerals one. 
So a big increase, 47% um, upgrade from the prior year, to 162 million tons, 
So, due to that upgrade, what you call support, uh, the 
ramp up we're doing, and the progressive expansion plan. 
So, lastly the expansion plans, where are we at? 
So, where I started earlier, we talked about expansion in terms of stage two, and an incremental stages of-of stage two. 
With a drop that uh, naming convention, and chose to remove… to more simplified uh, labeling, inaudible the 
p2680 project, I now recall, is the next incremental expansion, beyond the ramparts that we're in the thick of at the moment. 
This is provided 100,000 uh tons additional to our total production capacity, bringing us up to 680,000 tons per annum. 
Where are we at with this project? Uh, we're in the closing stages of de works and-and tagging it by the, uh, end of June quarter, all going well. 
Beyond that P1000 Expansion Project, which is, as the name suggests, heading out to 1000, uh kilotons per annum, and aggregate production from-from the operations, 
and we're targeting it by the… that expansion and the December quarter of this year. 
And obviously the project's space, administering um, project, 
which to remind everyone, is the production of-of the value added high purity, and chemical salts. inaudible is-is in the finalization stage at the moment. 
we're also, uh, completing an economic evaluation for that, and looking to announce that uh, up in the coming weeks. 
Um, beyond that uh, scoping study anouncment, 
we are uh, positively disposed to moving forward with that project. Um, with that partn Kelics ultimately, to commercialize 
um, that-that project and that approach, and-and bring what we think superior product to markets are. So, the ones of space and we look forward to updating on-on that accordingly. 
So, that's a rap up of inaudible reserve and projects, and at this point, I'll hand it over to Brian. All right, thanks! 
Thanks very much Dan, And good morning, or good afternoon, everyone. 
Um, if I think about the uh, the financial impact of the-the quarter that we just had, I-I 
sort of put it in-in sort of three-three-three different aspects. One is: obviously a very, very positive price environment, 
very strong operating margins generated, 
but with some of the operating challenges that-that was just uh, just gone through. We've-we've obviously had. Um, some impact in terms of higher, um, you know… operating costs. 
In terms of the-the physicals, 
um, we produce just over 83,000 pounds of spodumene concentrate, 
uh and so, about 75,000 pounds of concentrate that was produced on the Pilgram, and 
around 3,600 tons of concentrate was produced from the Ngungaju plant. 
So that uh, concentration increase inaudible of about 5000 tons, and we-we've closed the quarter with cloning stocks of about 16,000 tons, which-which 
represents about um, half a month's worth of production. 
In terms of price and operating margin, now I think everyone's aware, it has been quite an extraordinary improvement in pricing over the last quarter. 
And we averaged a-a price of somewhere between us 1.7 $5.8 $100 on an AC basis. 
And just as a reminder that compares to pricing of 850 to $900 time that we uh, pay for the term that's quite extraordinary athletes and pricing. 
So with-with their pricing environment, clearly we're generating a 
much stronger operating margins or margin was about us 
115 metric tons per inch for the term self employed under 75,000 tons from Pilgan. 
Um, so with that strong operating margin. There's been a-asignificant increase in the company's cash position. 
Sp, this 
position will have a $137 million dollar amount, obviously we're gonna require cash required cash but the DLT, as well for for shipment that occurred in accordance 
with the $1377 million 
at the end of December, we now find ourselves turning $245 million 
dollars. That's-thats an increase of just under $109 million 
dollars. But that increase come from, 
so the-the cash operating margin and the trillion without generating revenue there's about 116 million dollars for the quarter. 
We also through the trunk that we sell and nitrogen even in ramp up and commissioning phase, 
we actually still generate a positive cash flow of about buying the salad and 3600 pounds for my particular operation. 
Capital has been acquired a 
business with about 20 to $27 million and money spent on the pilgrim plant improvements 
on the restart of the magnitude operation the commissioning and also on the visual waste mining is currently being undertaken. 
But that was largely offset by the drawdown of updates. is offset buy the drawn down of updates. So during the quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our debt inaudible with, with our banks by US $20 million. 
Um, that was done deliberately to help us fund the, the restart with the managing operations. So that, that year end $29 million dollar agreement was signed, signed up during the quarter and the moneys were drawn down in December, 
and that was, uh, inaudible 20, $27 million Australian dollars. 
inaudible paid about $2 million dollars, um, in interest inaudible and inaudible was 
paid a, a cash sweep under the, the debt facility of about 2, US $2 million dollars as well. 
So at the end, end of the quarter, we'll end up with about $245 million dollars of cash, and that represents a, a, a, net cash position, so net update of around about $68 million. 
So clearly this quarter, 
um, has been a significant, uh, significant for the company and, and prices have come in a much, much stronger financial positions, 
uh, then, then we were, uh, at the start of the quarter. 
The, the only… the, the one downside to inaudible for the quarter, uh, from a financial point of view is, is, is the intermittent operating costs. 
So the inaudible operating costs clearly had been impacted by the charging operating environment that we, that we faced during the quarter. 
Um, and was US 5 to 97 
per ton, um, which was, which was about an US 140 per ton higher than the unit operating costs for the September quarter. 
So that increase of $142, about 56 US, US 56 of that really relates to royalties. 
So obviously it's the, uh, selling price environment is, is, is going up. 
Um, we are paying a much higher royalty, so that $56 of that increase remains 
solely true to the fact that we are having to pay higher royalties as the result of receiving a high selling price. 
The remain $86, um, is really attributable to the fact that we're generating lower levels of inaudible and inaudible production. 
inaudible, um, alluded to really was, as a result of trying to shut down to facilitate the tying of the Pine improvement project inaudible. 
We have inaudible, um, the maintenance and equipment issues that needed to be rectified. 
We also have with a, with a lower recovery as I 
mentioned, this is right… really due to the fact the, the, the inaudible been presented to the platform ordinance as optimum as it, as it should be. 
And then we were also impacted by the fact that there's just a lack of mining production and maintenance personnel in, in the market which, which impacts, uh, how the operations, 
um, gets, gets run. 
Now, if I think about those top increases, um, you know, they are I think, unique to the challenges that we're currently facing. 
I don't think they are necessarily something which is going to be a permanent increase. 
And other than the, the higher inaudible which are inaudible, my expectation is as we, 
as we achieve these type productions from the operations that those types will come back to, to the levels that we are prior to previously. 
As, uh, as Dale 
mentioned, um, before, we are currently undertaking a review of, of our production and, and whether we need to revise our production guidance 
and if there is any impact of that production guidance on unit costs and inaudible, we will automatically be making a disclosure at the same time in, uh, it might inaudible when we, when we have released our half year accounts. 
So I think that, uh, that's everything I, I wanted to go through. So Ken and Mike, I'll hand it back to you. 
Yes, thank you Brian. Thank you, Dale. 
Um, a bit more commentary about the market 
and, in particular, 
uh, apologies in advance for delving into a little bit of detail about a pricing environment that I think is particularly important to, 
to explain how that works so that you have a greater understanding of the opportunities that the current market represents. 
Um, obviously given my inaudible has got to, there is a growing disconnect between available supply, uh, and urging demand. 
Urging demands driven by, you know, all those being that 
represent opportunity in electrifying the global economy but inaudible are now key to that, but hence the gross in demand. 
On the supply side, 
um, without wanting to put words in other producers mouths, I don't think their experience is necessarily any different to Pilgrim Minerals. 
It is tough to bring on additional capacity 
in an environment where you were previously being punished. Very low passing environment has meant that, that every producer has slowed down. 
Um, so I think it's highly likely, um, that, that on the supply side 
there will be challenges and it's probably the case that there's a supplier inaudible already been over 
stages. Um, so it's against that, that challenging environment that the inaudible is, is surging. 
And, um, and it's, and it's kind of perverse, 
but for the very same reason that Pilgrim Minerals had a challenging production quarter, you are likely to see pricing increase because the supply response is insufficient. I hope that makes sense. 
On pricing itself, and delving into a little bit of the detail, 
Flex reported China domestic pricing in battery grade lithium carbonate of 386,000 
yen per metro ton, lithium carbon equivalent basis. 
So that's over USD $60,000 US dollars a ton in China. 
Now people will tend to want to dispute that price because they… It's, it's, I think somewhat unfairly described as a spot price. 
But what's actually been discovered in that price survey, is the real price being paid by the same relationship by a long time seller and a long term buyer who are constantly renegotiating the price and volume. 
So what it is, so what I think it represents is the real price of the chemical conversion industry inaudible in China. 
R- you know, baring in mind that China is the world's largest lithium raw materials market. 
And I think all the evidence points to that price being a real price because it's also driving an international pricing, 
which typically has longer dated contract. 
But international pricing, um, is already approaching 50,000 US dollars a ton, 
so… So for those that want to characterize it as a spot price, I think that's a little bit of a misrepresentation. 
It is the price that the chemical conversion industry receives. 
But why is that important? 
This is where the spodumene supply base, um, 
ultimately, uh, has it stay in the front. And I think Pilgrim Minerals is particularly well placed inaudible in that pricing environment. 
What inaudible is, is a chemical converter. It's receiving 60,000 or over $60,000 USD per tons for there, for their battery grade carbon. 
If you deduct the VAT and you deduct the cost of chemical conversion, 
they have approximately $50,000 left to spend on their raw materials. 
$50,000 left to spend on their raw materials of which spodumene is obviously a key component. 
What that means is, that the chemical conversion industry can pay a lot more for spodumene, and in my view, they likely will. Because there is no alternative. 
They'd already have chemical conversion capacity, of which there is inaudible in China, 
but there is insufficient spodumene to backfill the chemical conversion capacity. 
The net effect of all that, is that they will pass their margin upstream. Which means spodumene pricing is already very strong, 
but in my view likely to get stronger. 
And I know everyone thinks that sounds like a pretty extraordinary scenario, 
but have a think about this. It's not iron ore. Spodumene and it's 
derivative chemicals are part of an industrial mineral supply chain turning into a specialty chemical supply chain 
for which most suppliers will already be contractually bound. 
They are contractually bound to sell chemicals 
to a inaudible materials player, or, or a spell maker, maybe in China but equally probably Japan and Korea. 
They are contractually bound, but they don't have the material. And what that means is that they will pay virtually anything from the raw material. 
So the dynamic in th- you know, that I'm describing is one that's very different to what most people might be used to in natural resources markets 
because, you know, if you took iron ore as an example, that's a very large liquid pool of available product. 
That's not what, what's represented by an industrial minerals supply chain where people are, 
um, have built purpose… you know, purpose build chemical facilities to match a combination of import raw materials fee for a defined quality to a customer, there's probably a inaudible trust in 
the down stream. So, so all those dynamics create something that's very unusual in the pricing world when there's such a bad disconnect between available supply and surging demands. 
So, so that's what's going on in spodumene markets. 
Quite incredible. I think Pilgrim Minerals is really well placed. We've probably outperformed as it relates to price received in the December quarter. 
And the March quarter is already looking very, very strong. 
So we've guarded to between 2,600 and 3,000 US dollars a ton CIF China on a 6% spodumene basis. 
Um, because we see lithium chemicals pricing being very strong which represents a, a key, 
a key peg to our spodumene price. So, so yeah. Incredible times. Um, but nonetheless, Pilgrim Minerals will be having it's day in the sun. 
So that's the detail in the, the spodumene market. The other means by which we look to take advantage of that is through the, the BMX platform. 
The BMX platform, um, will typically handle, uh, excess products from our inaudible production, 
most of which is coming through the inaudible in overdue production, which is coming. 
We've only been producing through the H&S circuits so far. 
Um, we're continuing to strip away that and this location circuit with the expectation that this location starts during the latter part of the current quarter. 
Um, in which case we should have more product available for the BMX platform, 
um, and we're looking forward to the price discovery that that flushes out. 
So, to close. 
Uh, in 
summary, um, it's a challenge bringing on the two plants and the expanded capacity that they represent, especially in light of, but the type inaudible market, 
um, that WA currently suffers from, 
we're all looking forward to the borders opening because it's ultimately, it should provide some relief to those type labor market conditions. 
Um, inaudible whilst with a challenging quarter, 
uh, it's not just Pilgrim Minerals experience, we expect that just about every resources company is going through similar issues, including the other, 
uh, the other lithium raw material providers. 
What does that point to? Well it points to, at least in part, constraint supply, which points to probably higher price. 
We think we are really well placed to take advantage of that in the coming quarters. 
Um, I'm confident in the team and their ability to, to bring on the remaining capacity. 
Um, in which case we will have a very, very good year. 
Rachel, I'm going to throw it back to you. I'm sure that we've plenty of interesting questions, uh, one phone call but equally some that will come out 
of our webcast. 
So, yeah, look forward to people's questions. Thank you, Rachel. 
Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. 
If you wish to cancel your request, please press start two. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. 
Your first question comes from Al Harvey from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hey guys, Ken and team. 
Uh, just a couple from me. Um, perhaps just starting with the recovery, um, across Pilgangoora. Just wondering with, uh, 
Ngungaju, when do you think… uh, what's kind of the expected maximum recovery you'll think you'll be able to get there once you bring the inaudible online. And what sort of timing do you think we might be able to, um, see 
that across? Yeah, Al, yeah so in the 
details there, um, 
Pilgan was compromised by the new equipment being brought on as part of the improvements project and the effect of a less than optimal blend. 
Um, so that we experienced recovery at Pilgan at sort of 65% versus 75%. 
Uh, at Ngungaju, the recovery was materially lower while we're using inaudible silica with 
the transitional ore. So nominally, 30% recovery until we bring on the inaudible circuits. Target 
recovery 
for Ngungaju over time, with a fully optimized 
circuit, is likely in the order of high 60s, 70% 
as compared to Pilgan being 75% per inaudible, so. 
Yeah, that's really helpful. Thanks Ken. Just secondly, just on the FID sort of inaudible and P1000, just 
I'm wondering, how long after FYC, if, if they are successful, could work in the, given the inaudible labor markets your seeing. 
And just any commentary on the perhaps percentage increase s in capex. You've been staying relatively priced. Yeah. So, 
I'll try to inaudible. 
Into the timing around inaudible target execution of the inaudible posted by the. 
The good news is for the P6A could be, could be fairly quick, 
um, it's been a, that project is effectively an expansion to the HMS inaudible. Um, 
so the function of engineering timing normally 
inaudible construction could, could be soon. Could be as soon as six months, starting as soon as six months inaudible. 
But we wouldn't expect, um, likely, the, the ramp up of that for maybe 9 to 12- unlikely that the ramp up of that, so maybe nine to 12 months post- 
FID. Um, that's largely driven by our estimates around long leads. 
Um, as to, uh, capital, um, increase and cost increases, uh, we've definitely observed, uh, 
escalation a- a- across the board. That's in the WA environment, steel prices and the like. 
Uh, we haven't translated that through quite yet t- to the, to the CapEx forecast for this particular project, 
but of course we will, we will do that, uh, by, by the FID 
decision. Hope that answers your question now. 
Yeah, thanks, Dale, and just maybe with the 
P1000, d- do you, you think that will have a, a longer, um, a build time frame after FID 
just given that it's bigger? The, well, one of the questions we haven't resolved yet is, is actually the staging of, of that particular part of expansion. 
It's potential that we might uh, choose to forward order long leads and the long leads of the both those two expansions really drives the critical part, it's not so much, 
uh, in our view of a labor, 
um, um, constraint. It's more long leads, and uh, as it relates to the, um, P1000. 
Uh, the good news there is, 
uh, we already have, uh, the HPGR for that circuit. 
Um, so for us, it would be really around looking at bore mill, timing, and, and deployed cells principally. All the other things are, are largely in hand. 
So, um, we could be, uh, well placed potentially to merge fairly quickly with that one. 
Great. Thank- thanks, Del. If I can just sneak one last one in, just wondering if you guys have a rough, um, swift 
of product that goes into hydroxide 
versus carbonate converters, and, and whether or not that was changed substantially since those bigger, bigger increases in carbonate frothing versus the hydroxide froth? 
Yeah, our customers, the contracted customers 
do a mix of both, so it's very difficult to determine exactly how much goes into the carbonate chemical suite versus hydroxide. 
But to be honest, in today's environment, you can, 
you can be ambi- ambivalent about it 
because any, any, um, primary hydroxide producer, IE straight from inaudible hydroxide it's probably 
three things, hydroxide through carbonate, a very low cost process of carbonation 
to take advantage of, of the carbonate price. 
So, 
and actually in the scheme of things, they're doing that for us with the same cost of, cost of chemical conversion carbonate anyway, um, because the primary hydroxide route would typically be a bit cheaper. 
Um, so from our point of view, we're, we're not overly fussed 
kind of one, one way or the other. We're ultimately being consumed, 
but given the price differential between carbonate and hydroxide, that, that's very much a likely market response twisting hydroxide to carbonate. 
Great, thanks Ken. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it. 
Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Ryan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Uh, good morning guys, just inaudible. 
Yeah, good question, Mitch, and it's hard to disagree with the logic that there's a small volume and a small price point that are established on such a platform. 
Uh, the better the combination of price transparency and market development for more sophisticated market tools to emerge. 
So broadly speaking, 
we're supportive of, of 
an objective that creates more products pricing on things like the BMX platform. 
Uh, so we're very open to those discussions, and it won't surprise you that those discussions, you know, are already underway. 
It seems like a very, very logical model to deploy, and it is the industry is absolutely crying out for, for stronger price, price transparency. 
inaudible you wouldn't necessarily be looking for a commercial benefit. 
I mean, a material commercial benefit, it would be more about the improvement, going to the market would benefit all players involved, I guess. 
That's right. Right in time, floats four boats. So, so yeah, it's pretty much that, that logic, 
and, and ultimately it's gonna be good for the market as a whole, because it gets more sophisticated methodology out there. 
Uh, we're not interested so much in the commercial potential, in, in that model. 
We're more interested version across all products, 
and, and in fact, Tilburn Minerals itself is also keen to put more cross points on the platform, 
IE, you know, exploring grades over time, and midstream products, and, and who knows. Uh, maybe our own lithium chemicals over time. Thanks, Ken. 
Thanks for answering my questions. 
Thank you. The next question comes from Jack Gabb from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Thanks. Uh, hi Ken. Uh, just a couple of questions from me. Firstly, just on the labor challenges, and particularly with respect to, uh, some of the stripping, I guess. 
This year was gonna be a bit of a catch up year for, for stripping rates. 
I'm just curious, is it going to pose a, a challenge at some point? Is it going to create a bottleneck 
for you, as you look to expand, or are you, have you got quite a lot of, uh, headway on that? Just that on my question, thanks. Yeah, Jack, 
a couple of introductory comments on that subject, and I'll hand to Dale. 
Yeah, you're right, this year, it was all about catch up, and we had about sort of 15 to 18 months worth of, of, uh, higher than light of mine strip to catch up. 
Uh, that's, that's 
dissipated, mobilizing more fleet, 
and larger fleet. It's been constrained by labor, so, so that's part of the challenge. Dale, is there anything else you want to add? 
Uh, the only thing I would add is, with the acquisition of Altura, for them more opportunities, with the access to all, 
so, uh, without question, there's a heap of material for ways movement, but, uh, 
we do have multiple areas to draw from, uh, so that puts us in fairly good stead as we think about various mine plans, 
et cetera. That's what I'd 
add. Perfect, thanks. And then just one on pricing. 
Can you give us a sense of, uh, the range, I guess, of your pricing, that you actually are seeing across your contracts, ignoring the BMX for a second, 
uh, within your guidance? And then, secondly, within that guidance as well, 
are you including any material volumes from the BMX platform at this point? 
Thanks. Uh, so Jack, on the second question first. 
Uh, 
in fact what we have described in the quarterly, 2600 to 3000 US dollars a pound represents an estimate of contracted pricing. 
So, uh, what we see today. 
Uh, so it's only, only contracted pricing excludes whatever might yet occur on the BMX platform. 
Uh, and I understand that there's probably a rich further outside of the function of the speed with which chemical has accelerated. 
Uh, oh, and yeah, sorry, the first question. Uh, actually, it's a relatively tight, uh, contract pricing across the customer group. 
There's really no material difference emerging, 
uh, in respect of the various pricing models. So that's pretty much approximated each other, 
within a couple of hundred dollars, you know, of, of each individual contract. 
Uh, and they do vary at a time, because they do use lots of different pricing modeling, but it's in the data. They all reference, 
uh, lithium… well, technically all reference lithium chemical. 
Uh, potentially that's a slightly different way, but the net outcome of the pricing is pretty tight. 
Thanks for your help, all. Thanks very much. I'll, uh, leave it there. Thank 
you. The next question comes from Peter Ker from the Australian Financial Review. Please go ahead. 
Good day Ken, thanks for your time. Uh, just wondering on the border, I assume you're not going to join the exodus of, uh, all the other inaudible who are coming next. 
Uh, and secondly, with the February fires delay, 
did that upend any plans you had in terms of, 
you know, did you have, uh, particular markets on the east coast you were targeting, as of Feb 6th? And, uh, yeah, how do you sort of cope now, with that, 
with that sort of indefinite uncertainty? 
Yeah, good question, Peter. Uh, I can assure you there was lots of cares in the Brisbane household, 
uh, with the border. Don't shut, February fires, given their locations, and, and, uh, the desire to catch up with them. 
Uh, with respect to work, 
uh, no, not my intention to merge with Melbourne, or, or Sydney. Uh, not any time soon. 
And didn't disrupt plans, well, 
the indirect impact of the border, that constrains short term labor 
supply, so they don't actually get to the heart of a lot of the issues that we've been dealing with, and especially while we're ramping up the two plants. 
When something breaks, or when we've got to do a, a shutdown, 
you typically can't get the labor, at least not in the way we used to, to create the peak load that's required to get the jobs done quickly. 
So a shutdown that should have taken, uh, 36 hours, takes, you know, takes 52, 
and, uh, and a, you know, broken bore nail coupling takes, takes sort of 56 hours to, to fix, when it should have taken 24. You know, that type of thing. 
Uh, that, that's really one of the key issues, and then our contractors, the mining contractors, feel it as well. 
Uh, they typically have a slightly higher sort of transitory workforce, and they're highly mobile, 
and what's happening now is everyone's fishing from the same pool in that, that contract that's 
stayed, uh, and it's leading to lots of, uh, you know… it's a challenge of accessing labor and hanging onto labor for our contractors. 
So, so yeah. It's, the border's been continued to close 
creates challenges in that key personnel, and, and the extent to which, which our contractors can retain their personnel. 
So the, it's a big issue. 
Uh, the sooner the border's open, and 
we get the, the, you know, the, the mobility back in the workforce is really the key. 
And so presumably you, you seen the negative impact of those labor challenges is greater than the COVID impact 
will be when it starts spreading through your workforce, you know, as it, as it is over here? 
Definitely some risk to, to the production environment, the WA mining companies, no two ways about it, though it should be relatively transitory, IE measured in months. You know, a couple of months, not, not six to twelve months. 
Thanks Ken. 
Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Baker from Global Mining Research. Please go ahead. 
Good day Ken and team. Uh, yeah, just a question on the, the mine grades. 
Uh, 
they've been above reserve grade at, uh, 1.18%, uh, for quite some time. Uh, just wondering, uh, you know, what your inaudible saying about, you know, coming back to meet with the reserve grade, you know, how far off are we from that? 
Yeah, good question 
to pick up, Adam. Uh, I'd say we're reasonably clear, historically, that 
Pilgan, or, or the original Pilgangoora operation was always mining a slightly higher grade in the two or four years, roughly, 
uh, of production. 
Uh, that's rather a function of the way the ore presents at Pilgangoora. So, 
uh, so nothing's particularly sort of tricky there. 
Uh, but the lower reserve grade, 
also, hasn't resulted from the, the addition of the south pitch, IE the former Altura operations, which again was always a lower reserve grade than the original Pilgangoora reserve grade. 
Uh, so that also explains some of the gap. 
Uh, yeah, 
so, uh, with being in 
production there for about two or three years, so we've got another year or two worth of slightly elevated grades, and, uh, and then, and then they'll start to revert more to the, to the reserve north. 
Sure, thanks for that. Uh, to inaudible, yeah, you mentioned that, uh, you know, there's going to be a, a potential review to go with the half year result in February. 
I'm just wondering to the impact to the second half financial year 2022 got 
us, but just wondering how likely it is to impact the target of 540 to 580 inaudible by mid 
year. So, yeah. Yeah, all discussions come, you don't know we've got about another four weeks prior to the half year as well. There are several things going through our mind there, 
and the next three or four weeks will probably be informative. 
Uh, the first is the effect of continuous planning. Uh, there's 
a big gap between the historical production at 300, 30,000, inaudible tons per annum, 
compared to where we're going, 580,000 inaudible concentrate tons per annum, 
and that guidance has been reviewed to the speed with which we can bring on that capacity. 
Uh, so we really need another three or four weeks to see how we go with the patch, 
uh, and, and, you know, the work that's already happened, and integrating the combination of new equipment, especially targeted 
to, where we're bringing on the operations circuit. 
Uh, so that's part one. 
Uh, as to absolute production capacity, a 580,000 tons will, you know, we're still confident about getting that run rate, even the middle of the year, 
uh, as a function of both tax, and, and their performance. 
So, so the figure we're sensitive to is the remaining ramp up. 
Uh, lastly, it's worthwhile mentioning the borders and COVID. You know, there's obvious community transmission going on here now. Mining companies are going to start feeling that. 
Uh, so we are sensitive to, to what that impact might be. Now indirectly, it's already hurt us, because we, we struggled to get these people, as I described. 
Uh, but it's possible there's also production impact from the community transmission, and how that relates to our available workforce. 
So, given- To our available workforce. So give us another three or four weeks knowing we'll have that largely cleared, cleared up, and, um, we'll provide a more definitive guide. Awesome. 
Thank you. Thank you. There are no further telephone questions at this time. I'll now hand over to Nicholas Reid for any webcast questions. 
Thanks Rachel, we have a number of, uh, questions that have been logged online to the team here. 
Um, firstly, uh, some questions from John Beckworth. 
He says, Could you please expand on the company's, uh, strategy and the initiatives that have been put in place to deal with the current skills and labor challenges and risks 
in WI? 
Yeah, a good question, John, um, and, yes, of course there has already been actually significant response. 
Um, so the first thing is to taken on, um, some of the, the challenge I feel, um, inaudible Minerals have commenced its own mining fleet. 
And the logic in doing that, uh, it's multifaceted. But one of the key drivers is 
the relative accessibility of longer term employees by inaudible and Mineral as compared to our contractors. 
Um, and it's all to do with the way the workforce works here in WA. 
Most employees, not all, but most employees would say longer term employment with an established company is a safer bet. 
And I think we also trade on the benefits of being involved in the new economy in mining, um, factory raw materials, which is seen as the future 
and hence that, that brand has a better, um, attraction and retention status. 
So that's the key thing that we've taken on ourselves, and, uh, so far so good, we haven't had too many traumas accessing 
tables, uh, ourselves, but certainly our contractors have. 
Um, there has also been, 
um, work done with respect to retention. So for example, the way we pay our people, the bonuses and their benefits, we've done work on our camp, you know, there's lots of things that have happened, 
um, that, that should have the desired effect of attracting and retaining people over time. 
Um, with respect to our contractors, we've done a bit more sort of innovative thinking with them. 
Again, roosters, you know, um, you know, the can and, and in certain circumstances, the way they're incentivized, um, with a view to helping attract and retain people. 
The one key challenge, which we still haven't really broken, the backlog, is the peak labor that I described when you, when you need this, you know, large numbers of personnel to shut down 
and or break down. 
Um, that is an area that's still our concern. 
And, uh, and again, not a challenge that we're dealing with on our own, it's a, it's a broad, a very broad issue for, for the mining companies here in WA generally. 
I hope that makes sense, John. 
Thanks James. Two, two others from John here. 
Um, the forego in the share price over the last week or so, uh, how much of that did you distribute to the global market correction, 
and how much to invest to concern about the risks and challenges that 
been discussed today? 
And secondly, can you update us on how the company's thinking about dividend policy, given the strong forms financially based on time. Um, well, with 
respect to, um, diversity and that 
I think it's largely trading in line with its fears. Um, I don't think there's anything particularly special that has gone on there that relates to silver and mineral specifically. 
Um, it wouldn't be unusual to have a pullback, 
uh, when, well, when lithium stocks had run as hard as they had, 
um, but also taking into account broader sentiment issues in global markets. 
Um, uh, the specter of inflation, uh, you know, has clearly led to a bit of a risk off attitude and I would attribute most of the share price movements, 
you know, to that, to 
that effect. Um, second question is- Dividends. Uh, dividends, dividends, um, yeah, well, um, as described by Dale, uh, we have a lot of, um, growth ahead of us, 
uh, which we think represents a, you know, a reasonable reinvestment in our business. 
Um, that's 
important, uh, and ultimately depends on what the product 
does, but, but inaudible you know, cost will be one of their assessments as to whether dividends ultimately become part of the story for the medium 
term. So, so more to be discovered in that regard, uh, John, before we can do this interview about dividend stream. 
Thanks James. Uh, question from Rob inaudible. He says, With respect to your impressive balance sheet strengthening, 
does your midstream project find more resources and can you look at ways to increase the market of this product? 
Also, can you please clarify if the product is being targeted directly at Chinese LCS inaudible? Oh. Okay. That's a, a good question. 
Um, well, we very much like the, the midstream product and, and Dale said, um, I think 
the word is something like a very competitive product or a compelling product for the market, something like that. 
I can't remember. Anyway inaudible compelling product in the market and reach out in this inaudible supply chain is going to be a, a big part of the future of our industry. 
Uh, because there are more efficient solutions. 
So, um, we're working with our partners fast as we can on that project. Um, really happy to be working with Calyx and their smart team. 
Um, but it's still got engineering development to, to, to be undertaken, and it's very difficult to, to short circuit that. 
Um, so more work to be done and probably more to be said about that as we look to publish the first round of engineering, uh, in the coming weeks. 
Um, I think that's pretty much it. 
Thank you. All right. Uh, next question is from Hayden inaudible says, uh, Is the long term production targets, post the expansion, still approximately 1 million tons per annum? 
Or have you made some changes to long term recovery assumptions? And secondly, what percentage of sales in 2022 are likely to be on the next platform? Okay. 
Yep. Um, yeah, 
so, long term production, Hayden, is still targeting beyond one million tons per annum of inaudible concentrate, and 
broadly speaking, 
you know, that should happen in the periods of two thousand and, the late part 2023 to 2024 onwards. Um, now, 
more work to be done, um, from an engineering and a delivery point of view. 
Um, but we, we have no doubt that Pilgangoora as a production center, 
um, has that capacity. And it will be a very important part of the globe abroad so yes, very much still in the future. 
Um, with respect to recovery it's actually no, nothing's changed, um, with respect to our views around recovery. 
Um, consistent with previous commentary, 
um, slightly lower recoveries at Naga due to the function of the way that plant works in comparison to, to Kilgan. 
Um, and, and, and slightly lower head grade overall likely to be said to, you know, do overtime. 
Um, but recoveries still the same and, uh, and the flotation's still a very important part of the future at Pilgangoora. Um, whether at Pilgangoora or at inaudible 
Um, okay, crosstalk- crosstalk sorry inaudible yeah. Um, well, 
there's still some uncertainty. So, 
uh, that's a function of how quickly we can bring on the remaining capacity at inaudible from a production point of view, it's still relatively early days because we're only relying on, 
on HMS in the transitional or, 
um, the flotation circuit construction is well advanced. 
Um, we're into the, the sales now and, and still expecting that those, um, sales will be fired up from a construction point of view and finishing off the, 
the last of the construction in the sales to align it with our flotation techniques. 
Um, and a view that they'll be commissioned from later in the March quarter. 
Um, so then the question is how quickly we can bring that on to bring on additional capacity because at that capacity 
and, and whatever we can stretch to gain too, that becomes excess capacity to go to the next platform. 
Um, so it's difficult to be definitive, to be honest, Hayden, about what ultimately gets sold on spot. Uh, this half, 
once the plant is at full capacity, so 580,000 tons, 
then approximately 200,000 tons of that is available, 
you know, at our disposal to sell as we choose. And, and at the moment we would choose to sell 
by far the majority of that to the BMX platform because pricing is going to be very strong. 
Chemical conversion industry is going to give away their margins to secure inaudible management supply in which case, inaudible management supply, you know, or pricing, 
um, will surprise the outside. 
Thanks James. 
There are a couple of other BMX questions so I'll just group them together, and apologies, we're going over the same ground here. But one was to extend concern are you expecting the BMX, 
uh, option this quarter? 
Yes, that's, that's right, yeah. 
And the second one was if all goes well with the magnitude files, can 
you give some sort of estimate of how many BMX files and senators in total that you're expecting for this calendar year? 
Uh, yeah, just similar to my, my previous comments about the speed with which the Navigator client comes on, um, 
I can be more definitive about it once the capacity then builds out because then you would have approximately an option every, every three weeks roughly, 
um, as represented by the, the total active capacity that makes its way to the spot market. 
Great, thanks Ken, uh, 
a, a question here from inaudible he says, As the company moves relatively quickly to inaudible 1,000, what concerns 
should there be or why are they with, with, uh, shipping movements to, to markets given 
viable shipping challenges and increased costs? 
Uh, yeah, 
um, well, our clearance is that we're, we're, we don't have difficulty accessing vessels that are not trade, um, and vessels 
available in our sector, 
um, that, that we don't inaudible have difficulty accessing the vessels themselves, it's just the cost of attracting the vessels that's the, the issue. 
Um, there has been some relief, uh, a little bit of relief in this quarter with respect to shipping costs. 
Um, we take in shipping costs at about 70 to 80 US dollars a ton. 
Um, average shipping costs from, from memory are about 55 
or crosstalk- Yeah, yeah. So it's come off, um, slightly, which, which is indicative of, of more of that thing's that available, 
but again, to make the point, it's not so much that you can't get a vessel, it's just the cost of the, of the vessel itself. 
Thanks James, just a couple of market-related 
questions to wrap up, first one from Mr. inaudible he asks if you can offer some commentary on, uh, on the impact on the lithium market after some recent developments we've seen, for instance, the Rio Tinto project in Serbia, and also some of the political changes in Chile. And any potential ramifications 
of those 
developments for lithium supple. 
Yes, um, well, first thing that comes to mind, and no disrespect to the analyst community, but it's easy to put supply numbers in a spreadsheet, it's not so easy to deliver them on the ground. 
Um, by the time you're doing that a lot more complexities come into play, uh, 
you've heard from, from Tilbara about difficulties in bringing in additional capacity. Well, our experience with, you know, is not, 
um, when I pay my loan, bringing on spot demand supply and lithium units globally is challenging. 
And especially when you think about a combination of, of volume, volume growth, and quality. 
And each of those are going to be 
overestimated, in our view, um, in which case markets will continue to be tight for, for quite some time. 
Um, we've heard many analysts over the years that, that lithium markets will be oversupplied, that there's plenty of lithium in the world but 
there's not plenty of lithium in the world that fits the right combination of location, quality, and supply, accessibility or infrastructure, 
um, in the right jurisdictions that don't otherwise suffer from geopolitical challenges. 
Um, yeah, I mean, 
it's a complex world of urban industrial minerals supply chain that, that doesn't want to be complex, but that naturally is. Thanks, 
Ken, one final one as a remainder question that's a good ones to wrap up on. 
Um, um, this gentleman says, Major car manufacturers will compete numbers for AV production 30 to 2030. 
Is there enough to achieve those production forecasts? Uh, 
I don't want to everybody trite but car makers have been asleep at the wheel. 
Um, they haven't been paying enough attention to the raw material supply in battery raw materials in the last five years. 
And it's coming back to haunt them 
because insufficient, um, incentive was placed in the market when it was really required and especially during that period three to five years ago, 
um, to get to where we need to be today. So, so not enough capital flowing upstream, not enough, 
uh, definitive off-take agreements that tie up the supply chain. 
Uh, not enough interconnected agreements that, that motivate the supply chain to, to, to be interconnected. 
Um, each of those things represents a, a serious challenge to the industry that should have been solved some years ago but now needs to be solved 
and will take some years to, to get right. Excellent. Thanks, Ken. That's all from crosstalk Okay. Thank you Nick, Rachel, it sounds like we're all done. Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
