Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to MTN Ghana's 2021 Q3 results conference call. All attendees will be listen only mode. 
There will be an opportunity to ask questions when prompted. 
If you should need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by pressing star, and then zero. 
Please note that event is being recorded. I would now hand the conference over to Mr. Jeremiah Opoku. Please go ahead, sir. 
Thanks, Judith. 
And good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss MTN Ghana's third quarter performance for the period ended 30th September 2021. 
I'm Jeremiah Opoku, investor relations manager for MTN Ghana. 
With me on the call today are Selorm Adadevoh, CEO of MTN Ghana, 
Antoinette Kwofie, our new CFO who joined us, who joined MTN on 1st October. 
Eli Hini, um, CEO of Mobile Money Limited. 
Kobina Bentsi-Enchill, general manager of MTN Ghana Finance and Thato Motlanthe from group… Um, group executive for investor relations. 
So Selorm will share an overview of our performance for the third quarter and outlook for the rest of the year before we move on to the Q and A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call operator. 
The call is scheduled for an hour, and if there are any more questions, uh, we may allow a five minute, um, time, extra time. 
Um, I'll now hand over the call to Selorm. Thank you. 
Thank you, Jeremiah. And good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for making the time to join us on this call today. 
On the call, we'll discuss our third quarter performance, and I'll also touch briefly on our expectations for the rest of the year before we move on to Q and A. 
In Q3 2021, we maintained the momentum from our half year performance 
underpinned by our diligent execution on Ambition 2025, investment in network and IT systems 
and ensuring our people remain a priority in light of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As of 26th October 2021, the official Ghana statistics on COVID-19 
showed a rise in the total infections and deaths to 103,000 and 823 respectively. 
MTN Ghana continues to extend support to cherish customers through our Yello Hope initiatives, 
including the zero rating of all Mobile Money P2P transfers up to a value of 100 Ghana cedis a day. 
And we're also running the One More Push campaign to encourage everyone to wear a mask and get vaccinated. 
We at MTN continue to adhere strictly to all COVID-19 protocols, 
with the aim of safeguarding the health and safety of our people and of our customers. 
And we also remain committed to Ghanaians and the environment, in support of the continuing fight against COVID-19. 
Turn into our operational performance for the period, we recorded a 25.4 year-on-year growth in service revenue driven mainly by data and Mobile Money. 
We continued to deliver on our infrastructure modernization plan and implemented CapEx related infrastructure projects to expand 4G capacity, 
4G coverage, and to improve the quality of service for our customers. 
Over the period, we invested a total CapEx of approximately 1.060 billion Ghana cedis, 
which includes the rollout of 959 4G sites, the modernization of 1,543 existing 4G sites, 
and this helped expand our 4G population coverage by 4.7 percentage points to 84.7%. 
We grew our cus- We grew our active subscriber base by 0.4 million quarter-on-quarter to 
25.2 million, and this reversed the decline in the last quarter that we experienced. 
This was supported by our network investments, digital offerings and an improvement in quality of service overall. 
Looking at the various business segments, we recorded a 51.9% year-on-year growth in data, 
driven by increases in our active data subscribers and total data consumed within the period. 
The contribution of data to service revenue expanded from 29% to 35.1%. 
Voice revenue recorded a single digit growth of 2% year-on-year. This, the 
growth in voice continues to be impacted by shifts in customer behavior towards data and implementation of SMP directives. 
The contribution of voice to service revenue declined from 42.5% to 34.6% year-on-year. 
We expect the trend in the voice segment to continue as a result of continued growth in smartphone penetration and the preference for data services by consumers. 
However, we expect data growth to compensate for the slower growth in voice. 
Mobile rev- Mobile Money revenue increased by 45.3% year-on-year, supported by increased active users, 
higher P2P transactional activity 
and growth in advanced services such as retail, merchant payments, micro loans, insurance, and international remittances. 
The contribution of Mobile Money to service revenue increased from 19.6% to 22.8% year-on-year. 
We recorded a 23.8% year-on-year decline in digital revenue, which was a result of the continued impact 
from the application of the principle versus agent accounting standard across the MTN group in 2020. 
On normalized basis, digital revenue increased by 14.4% year-on-year, supported by growth in our active digital subscribers. 
Reported EBITDA increased by 27.5% year-on-year, with a margin expansion of 1.1 percentage point to 54.4%. 
And this was supported by our continued focus and execution of our expense efficiency program. 
Profit after tax growth for the period was 34.0% year-on- year. 
And as announced the last quarter, we paid the interim dividend of 0.03 Ghana cedis per share. 
In total, an amount of 369 million Ghana cedis. And this payment happened on 14th of September 2021. 
Looking at the regulatory landscape, the National Communications Authority, the NCA through the telecom operators 
is embarking on a six-month nationwide SIM re-registration exercise using a Ghana national ID card as the sole card for this purpose. 
This exercise will run from October 1st 2021 to 31st March 2022. 
MTN has begun this exercise and remains committed to support the government to register all existing and new subscribers on our network. 
As announced in the previous quarter release, MTN Ghana implemented the directive from the NCA on phase one of the on-net, off-net price differential removal 
on default tariffs for voice, data and SMS from 1st of August 2021. 
Phase two is scheduled to be implemented on November 1st 2021, to extend beyond the default types to cover promotional offers and special offers. 
Including the above remedy, we have implemented all three of the seven SMP remedies defined to date by the regulator. 
We will update the market and the implementation of the remaining four directives as discussions with the NCA progresses. 
Now turn into our outlook. 
We expect to maintain the business momentum through the last quarter of the year. 
We'll continue to expand 4G coverage and improve our network to further enhance subscriber growth and customer experience. 
In addition, we'll progress the execution of the expense efficiency program in our prudent approach to managing cost, to deliver on our commitment of margin expansion. 
We'll continue to support our employees, our customers and communities 
as we deliver against our Ambition 2025 focus areas for the year, in order to capture long term 
growth opportunities and creates sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers, and I look forward to interacting with you over the next one hour. Thank you very much. 
Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to press star, and then one on the inaudible or the keypad on your screen. 
If you decide to withdraw your question, you're welcome to press star, then two to exit the question queue. 
Just a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to press star, and then one. 
The first question comes from a Jonathan Kennedy-Good of JP Morgan. All right. 
Good afternoon, and thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. 
Um, first one is on 
selling distribution and marketing expenses. I just, um, wanted to check whether… You know, it looked like, I think there was 24%, 25% 
growth in that fairly large, um, OPEX line. 
Um, just trying to understand whether there were any one thoughts there, or it was due mainly to the pandemic base of last year, 
um, and, and trying to get a handle on, on what we should expect growth to be like 
in that, um, expense line going forward. 
And then on 
the implementation of phase two of the, uh, regulation on on-net, off-net pricing, 
how do you expect that to impact voice revenue? Should we s- 
Would it, would it be substantial pressure on the voice line or, um, could, could growth be maintained? 
Okay. Thank you for your, for your questions. Let me start off with the first one, which is the distributed, the distribution and market and expense line. 
Um, so this is really an anomaly for this year. This year's our 25th anniversary. 
And as part of our 25th anniversary, we've had various programs which have shifted our, our expenditure, I guess, patterns. 
So, you know, that spike you see or that anomaly you see in Q3 is as a result of the 25th anniversary. This should normalize through, so no major concerns there. 
In terms of phase two of the SMP on-net, off-net, 
I believe the last time we spoke, I shared our estimate at the time, um, to be about 1% impact on total revenue. 
Um, the current implementation we're, we're undergoing may increase that number slightly, maybe somewhere around the 1.2% to 1.5% in 
terms of the total SMP impact on that. 
Um, but until we've implemented it and seen what the trends are, it will be a bit difficult to be very specific. We're here assuming things around how customers will, will react in terms of elasticity 
and, and all of that. But I'm fairly confident we should land somewhere in that range for the SMP on-net, off-net, um, 
as far as the, the expectations are. Great. Thank you. 
Jonathan, does that conclude your questions? Yes, it does. Thank you. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Preshendran Odayar of Nedbank. 
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Uh, congratulations on your results and thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions. Sorry, I've got, I've got four. I hope they're not too long. 
Um, first one is, um, around the new sim registration procedures. 
Um, would that pose any challenge to meet the March 2022 deadline? Uh, and are there any subscribers 
at risk that you guys know about? And, and linked to that, what would be the revenue impact if those subscribers had to be disconnected? 
Uh, secondly is 
I noticed you reiterated your, um, timeline to have the localization of 25% of the telco and 30, 30% of the Mobile Money business by the end of the year. 
Can you just give us an update on your progress to date? Um, 
I think the last time we spoke there was the employee share scheme that, that helped on the localization of, um, the sell down. I think there was only about 8 to 10 
inaudible that still needed to be done for the telco. 
So just an update on that and also what progress you've made on the mobile localization would be much appreciated. 
Uh, the last two is, um, I noticed you're still also zero rating your P2P transfers under a hundred, uh, Ghana cedis. 
Um, what is the revenue impact of this? 
Uh, the last time we spoke, which was at interim, it was roughly around six million Ghana cedis per month. 
Um, so how has that transpired with the increase in mobile subs? 
Um, and the last one is how much… I mean, I don't know if you can tell us how much of your 45% increase in mobile revenue, 
um, would be at attribut- attributable from integrating MoMo into the Ayoba, MTN Ayoba during the period. 
I know there was some integration in there, um, that, that seemed quite positive. So, 
I mean, is there anything, um, that could be attributable from that integration in your MoMo revenue? Thank you very much. Sorry. 
If can, just… If you could just repeat that last question, it wasn't too clear. 
Sure, sure. So your inaudible… So I believe you integrated MoMo into the MTN Ayoba platform during the period. crosstalk 
So how much of your 45% increase in MoMo revenue could you, could you if possible attribute to, to that integration? 
Okay. Gotcha. All right. 
So let me start with that one. 
Um, to be honest, there… 
Ayoba is still quite, quite young, and we've seen, you know, quite some interesting behaviors. But at this point, I think any revenue attribution will be, 
you know, will be a little premature. 
So that amount is quite low so we can, we can ignore that for purposes of materiality at this point. 
Um, the whole essence is to build a behavior. And at some point, we'll see a lot more significance around that behavior. 
The second question, let me start from the top in terms of SIM registration. 
Um, you know, the first question was on SIM registration and whether there is risk on the March 2022 deadline. Absolutely. There is, there is risk. 
Um, this is a major undertaking. And as you can imagine, you know, once this starts, there are a number of key things we have to bear in mind. 
For starters, the national ID database currently has somewhere between 15 to 16 million registered customers. 
It's unclear to us how many of that, you know, are within each network. 
Um, but there are plans underway to expand the scope and the registration points to increase those numbers to closer to 20 million. Maybe somewhere between 18 to 20 million 
will be the expected number by, you know, by the end of March. 
The second element here is our rate of registration, new registration. There are still some teething issues we're dealing with 
around how to validate, um, with integrations with the National ID Authority. 
And so we believe all of these will be taken into consideration on the timeline. 
But at this point, our primary objective is for the base of NIA, which is national ID card registered subscribers, 
our objective is to maximize the registrations of our customers within that base as quickly as possible. 
We've declared… 
We've actually declared a few stations 
that will be doing registrations in areas where we don't have stores and, and operational centers, because it'll take too long for people to travel to us. 
So these are some of the plans we're putting in place, and this will happen nationwide on a calendar, starting from November. 
We're also investing a little bit more in devices so that we can have as many 
agents foot on the ground who can go around registering customers and doing the validations real time as well. 
And so the number of things we're putting in place to be able to do that… We've already developed some technical solutions as well that will facilitate the faster registration. So there's a lot of work 
That will facilitate the faster registration. So there's a lot of work that's going on. 
Uh, but there's absolutely risk. It will be… It will be a bit difficult to give numbers at this point because the exercise 
really just started. Um, but so far there've been some challenges with the integration, not just for MTN, it's an industry thing. 
Um, so, you know, I'm quite sure once there's a result, we'll have a better sense of the rate of registration and- and what the real risk means. 
Um, but so far we're definitely ahead in terms of our market share registrations, so we'll continue putting the focus on that side, to minimize the risk on the back end. 
On the second question, which was on localization and where we are with that. 
Um, so in terms of Scancom localization, which is up to 25%, 
I believe the last time we said we're at 17.5%, so that percentage hasn't changed, 
however, we are at advanced stages in discussions with various elements of the plan to- to, you know, execute that. 
So I think we are… 
I mean there is some risk in getting to the end of the year, um, just about the 25 mark for Scancom. 
Um, so they are working to the wire with this one. 
But- but today we have very good commitment, which will suggest that it's a… It's a management… It's a manageable, you know, ambition for us to get to that 25% mark. 
On the 30% to Scancom… Um, sorry, to Mobile Money, there is a dependency on getting to 25% on the parent company 
and then achieving an additional 5%. So and the focus there is achieving that additional 5% on the assumption that Scancom achieves the 25%. 
We do think that that will be, you know, quite challenging feat at this point. We continue to work with various offers on the table and interests, 
and for the timing it will be quite challenging. So, again, we're having chats with the central bank on the different options that we have there, and we'll update you in that- in that process. 
And for overall I would say, you know, we've made quite some good progress even though we haven't crossed any major milestone. We're very close to some milestones in the- in the coming weeks, 
and, um, we look at this process as quite positive from that perspective of things. 
The third question was on, you know, the free P2P and- and how much… How much revenue that represented in the quarter. 
Um, so, a total revenue of about 45 million, um, was the free P2P, if we assume we had charged for those transactions specifically, 
um, for the quarter three specific… Only the quarter three. 
And it's about the same amount, we went from about 35 million to 40 million quarter one, quarter two and 45 million in quarter three. 
Thank you very much. 
Sorry, Jeremiah, just a quick one. What… The… In the first half of the year it was around 34 million Ghana cedi's impact for the whole year. So are 
you saying in just this one quarter it was 45 million? 'Cause that's a big jump and it's- it's more than double. 
So in quarter one, it was 34 million. In quarter two, it's about 40 million, that total's about 73 million. Oh okay. And then in quarter three, it's 45 million. So 
I think you have your numbers next time. 
Okay, yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you very much, appreciate it. You're welcome. 
Thank you. The next question comes from Jake Ward of Ashmore Group. 
Hi 
Selorm, um, just on the couple of questions, um, on the active MoMo subscriber base, it just appears, looking through the quarterly releases, that the total sub… Total active MoMo subs 
has remained a bit unchanged at the back end of 2020, around that 10.5, 10.6 million level. Um, 
I'm just wondering what you think has caused that slow 
down, um, in getting new active subscribers 
and perhaps touching on the strategy that you may have in place to address that. And if you could also just remind us how you, at MTN, define an active subscriber here. 
Okay, thank you very much. 
So, yes, it's… If you look at the numbers we've hovered around the 10.5, 10.6 mark, uh, for multiple quarters. 
Um, just to emphasize that when we came out of Q1, we saw a decline in trend into Q2 which was quite concerning, 
in terms of MoMo subs. So we saw a 1.9% decline quarter two over quarter one. 
Um, in terms of quarter three, we've seen a reversal of that trend with about a 1% growth in MoMo subs over Q2. 
Um, of course, that means we still have some deficit to get to the Q1 levels, 
um, but the positive news is that the reversal is happening, and we have to continue to build off of that foundation. 
The reasons for the decline in the first place were a number of different things, but the most… 
The most impactful one was, you know, a pilot to implement ID's on cashout, right? 
So people requiring ID's to cashout cash from us. 
This was done, you know, in partnership with the central bank, or at least in alignment with the central bank, and there were considerations for cashout's to become a requirement… 
ID's on cashout to become a requirement for the entire industry. 
That determination has not as yet been done 
and we've have discussions with the central bank on the steps forward and no conclusions have arrived at this point. 
But there's a positive to all of this. We've also seen some impact of all of this in our efforts in trying to minimize and mitigate and fight fraud, 
and so there is that element which was the initial objective of all this, was, how do we… 
So the second component which was, you know, a benefit from this activity was the reduction in fraud or at least the management of fraud. 
We've seen quite some good improvement as a result of this initiative plus other initiatives we've put in place. 
But going forward, Q4, we have a full plan on how to accelerate and be more aggressive on subscriber acquisition, and 
we're executing on that plan. So I'm positive that we'll get 
through the rest of the year, um, with some positive trends in terms of new- new Mo active subscribers, and growth in the total subs for Mo Money. 
Thank you. Just a quick follow up on that, my last question. Are you able to disclose the number of MoMo subscribers who aren't active? Is that very different from the number you report? I can't recall 
your definition of active. Is it one such transaction per month? Yeah, so active is a revenue generating activity in 30 days, or at least one revenue generating activity in 30 days. 
Okay, that- that makes sense. And just one final one if I may. Then if people are taking advantage of the free P2P at this time, am I correct 
in saying that they therefore wouldn't show up because it's not a revenue generating transaction? 
Oh, no. The fact that you're not charging doesn't make it a non-revenue generating activity. P2P is a revenue generating activity, so they will show up, yes. Okay, great there. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Kuda Kudungure of Kela Securities. 
Uh, afternoon guys. Uh, thank you for, uh, hosting the call. Uh, 
I just have, uh, a few questions. Um, on Mobile Money, uh, what was your revenue mix over the third quarter for MoMo? 
Uh, and then the… Could you just maybe give us some insight into the, well, activity around your MoMo commissions? Uh, 
I mean, 
you know, there- there was quite a substantial growth over first quarter, second quarter. Understandably, the results of zero rating, and then something near, uh, multiple pullback for the third quarter. 
Um, and then, uh, on the data side of things, uh, how many 4G… Active 4G subscribers are currently on your network, 
and then how much data was consumed, uh, over the nine months? 
Okay, thank you very much. Um, let me start off with 
the MoMo commissions because that's quite an intricate topic 
that I'll probably spend a few minutes on, and I'll come back to active 4G customers and data consumption, 
I'll check if I have those numbers here. And then the revenue mix as well. 
So in terms of the commissions, um, you know, we've been… We've been looking at our commissions trend, you know, for a while now and I think they've been questions here on investors calls 
on the dilution of a better margin. You know, this came up last- last quarter as well. 
Um, what we've discovered is that there were some transactions that were manipulated by a set of agents and merchants that were on our network. 
And through the extensive exercise our revenue assurance team and the Mo Money team have done, we've been able to put a lid onto those activities. 
What that has meant is a portion of our commissions, which would've been paid out, you know, in previous months, 
will no longer be paid out, 
and the effects of that started in July. So you would see an improvement in commissions despite continued revenue growth, 
and that results in margin expansion for the quarter. 
Okay, so we've been looking at our commissions trend in the last quarter 
and we've identified some discrepancies in agent and merchant behavior 
that was resulting in a significant increase in our commissions overall. 
And through the work of the revenue assurance team and our Mo Money team have done, 
we've put a lid on this behavior and managed to- to arrest the situation with a number of initiatives that we've put in place. 
What this has meant though, is that our commissions… a portion of our commission that we have paid out in previous months, 
um, is no longer being paid out because we've noticed the trend and the, um, I guess the undeserved earnings of commission through this scheme. 
And as a result of that we've seen lower commissions in quarter three and higher and better margin and higher and better numbers for that same period. 
And we're confident we can maintain this trend going forward and that this trend reflects… Better reflects the commission revenue ratio of the business. 
Um, so we should see, you know, a lot more steady, a better, and commission rates going forward, as a percent of revenue. 
Um, so that's why you see the changes in revenue… In commission trend as well as a better trend for Q3, that's the main reason. 
So I'll pause to receive any specific… Any other questions on that, whereas I'll go to revenue mix and the other questions that you had. 
Um, nah, I think that- that answers much of it. Uh, quite amazing that, 
uh- uh, they'd impact, uh, transactions that much. I mean, those are some significant increases there. 
Uh, but yeah, please proceed. Yes. No, 
absolutely, it's, you know, quite significant. 
Okay. The second question was on the revenue mix of Mobile Money, and I'm guessing it's a split of, you 
know, what proportion is P2P versus cashout versus others? 
Correct, yeah. Advances, yeah. Uh, the advances, cashout and P2P. Okay. 
So in general we've seen quite a- quite a good growth in advance services during the period. 
Um, percent of total revenue from advance services is around the 19%, 20% mark. 
And we're seeing a continued growth in P2P as well, in terms of the percent of total revenue, 
um, around the 45% mark. And then the balance… 
Sorry, around the 35% mark, and then the balance will be from cashout. 
So it would be roughly 35% P2P, about 20% advance services and about 45% cashout. That's 
some, uh, significant growth in P2P 
there. Yeah we inaudible to see good… If you look at the P2P 
activity in terms of the P2P the customer, we're seeing quite healthy growth in those numbers, and then the activity continues to be good. 
Uh, okay, great. That answers the next question. Um, and I guess to the- to the data, uh, related question. 
I'll have to come back on the data question. Let me just pick up the details, apologies for that. I guess whilst we're waiting 
I do have another question. I- 
I noticed that you don't include 
extra time as a part of MoMo revenue and nor do you also include non-core mobile services. 
Now, what are non-core mobile 
services and how much was extra time, 
uh, over the- over the nine months inaudible? Okay. 
So we don't include 
extra time because it's not… Um, from the definition by our regulator, the central bank, 
um, extra time is not classified under Mobile Money, 
and you know, therefore including it means we'll be reporting businesses that are not governed by 
that particular regulator in the report that we send to them. So that's the main… 
That's the main reason we don't do that. 
Now, in terms of what is- what is non-core, 
there are a number of partnerships we have, for example, micro-insurance partnerships with aYo Holdings, that is non-core Mo Money revenue. 
So you can think of extra time and aYo revenue as non-core, and the totality of that will be our fintech portfolio. 
All right. Thanks for that. Uh, Kuda does that conclude your questions? Um, sorry, uh, on the 4G… Up to 4G subscribers, did you have that number or is… inaudible. Sorry, 
I'm trying to pull it up. Once I get it I'll let you know. Okay, all right. Appreciate it. That's all then. 
Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew inaudible of UPSA. 
Thank you very much. Um, I want to ask the question regarding the share performance on the Ghana 
pocket inaudible. Um, this year has been inaudible leading the market. Uh, 
I know you don't tell your staff to be watching the share price while they are on the inaudible, 
but, uh, you could be doing something that, you know, uh in the few words you can tell the inaudible is moving 
down, whether that really can continue into the future. 
But, you know, within six months or so, uh, we've seen some decrease 
from the highs of, you know, where it went, that is 1.24 
and then to 1.2. 
I know like what I said, inaudible 
share with us, you know, we are interested in appreciation inaudible. So if you 
can give us some hope for what to expect. Thank you 
very much. Okay. Well, thanks for your question. Let me just sort of start off with, um, you know, what we control and don't control, and the part that we play. 
I think the first thing as management is- is that our role is to deliver on the business performance and to deliver on our commitment to you our shareholders and our investors. 
Um, however, we do know and understand that there are other 
exogenous factors that drive share… There are other exogenous factors that drive share price and share movement on the stock exchange which are out of our control. 
So, the only commitment I can give is that, you know, we'll continue to deliver on the targets we've set. 
We already have committed to- to a modest, um, over- out performance of our median targets that we've given you 
and, you know, we give you our reassurance that we will continue to perform at that level as far as running the business operationally goes. 
Um, so from that perspective I think you can be- you can be confident in management's ability to deliver on these numbers. 
Um, and- and minus the associated risks and challenges that the market presents to us. Thank you very much. 
Going on to the next question which comes from Nana Wonanna of Access Pension. 
Hi. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question and congrats on another good performance. So, 
I just want to know management's outlook about Momo in the light of the potential launch of Central Bank Digital Currency I.e. the ECD. 
I mean you see the ECD compliments and inaudible Momo acceptance of inaudible with Momo. Thank you. 
Yeah, thanks- thanks for the question and, you know, very- very good question. It's something that we are very interested in watching as well. 
You know, at this point I wasn't gonna give you too much detail on our position but I think, you know, first of all the objectives 
of the ECD and what the Central Bank is trying to do, um, are definitely laudable. 
We see ourselves as a partner and as a… as a partner to continuing to digitize currency within the country and we do believe that we have a role to play. 
However, since this is a pilot from the Central Bank, 
their definition of how ECD will manifest itself beyond the pilot is still unclear 
and the role that the existing digital services will play is also unclear but we continue to work very closely with the Central Bank. 
And at the point when some of these definitions start to tease out, we're willing to share. 
Um, our view though is that, you know, Mobile Money has established, you know, a behavior within the marketplace 
and there's a lot of equity we can bring to a partnership to make easy to be successful. So, we see ourselves as a credible partner to the Central Bank 
and to further digitize the market using ECD. But we'll give you more details once it's clear. 
Nana, is that crosstalk The last, um, question… I mean it's got to do with the structure separation of the Momo, I mean, business. 
I mean do you see the potential extension in the timeline given that inaudible or 
you think, I mean you can do it within I mean the January 2022 deadline already in place? Thank you. 
Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. Look, and I think I was mentioning earlier that we definitely are to the wire here 
and we do have, you know, very concrete commitments and, you know, over 25% of the- the total localization targets. 
But there's still a gap we have to bridge to get to the 30% and we're working very hard on that. 
Um, so yes, is there some risk? Absolutely. I think, you know, in terms of timing there's some risk. But in terms of achieving the objective, we're confident we will 
and so you might just get an issue of a little bit extra time to close everything off. 
But we're confident we'll get to 25% in the coming months and then also confident that we'll have the full commitment to get to 30%. 
Perhaps the execution of that extra bit may need a little bit more time to tidy up. 
Um, so that's where we are and that's, you know, what we're working towards. Thanks. 
Thank you. That should be it for me. Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Smith of 337 Frontier Capital. 
Hi inaudible and good morning. Uh, thanks for the results, um, for 
the last quarter. Um, can- can you answer a question on market dynamics and market share. 
Um, what do you guys know what your market share in Momo is currently if you 
can expose that? Um, can you also talk about maybe competitive pricing in the market for Momo? 
Um, are you guys losing any market share to inaudible cash due to inaudible PTP across all pricing practice? 
And have you given any consideration to changing your 
pricing 
structure? Okay. So, the line wasn't too clear. I think you're asking what the competitive dynamics of Mobile Money is 
considering PTP price tactics? Is that correct? Uh, yes. Yeah, sorry, 
I know my line is not very good. Um, but yeah, that's the question. 
Okay. So, there're a couple of things, a couple of things going on. 
Um, you know, we do have one operator that has launched free PTP, or launched free PTP quite aggressively, 
um, last year and sustained that for, you know, for quite a long time. 
In the last few months, we've seen some intensity 
continuing to promote the free PTP across, you know, all networks but also across all value bands, 
which is a very aggressive promotion. 
Um, so absolutely yes. You know, we initially I think on the call last time around 
we discussed a little bit what some of the effects of that will be, at the beginning. We think we've gotten to a point of equilibrium to a large extent 
because the other things that we're also doing to try to support our customers and try to create value for our customers of our network. 
We're also continuing to expand our own ecosystem and advanced services. You see the growth in advanced services today represents the, represents 
the utility that customers see in the portfolio services inaudible Mobile Money. 
And we believe some of these initiatives will continue to be important 
in giving customers value but also serving the needs that are most important to them. 
From a landscape perspective, we, you know, we'll continue to monitor this. Now, the point where we feel that there's a need for us to do something is slightly different and we'll certainly do that. 
But you'll see some of our promotions that will be coming up at the end of the year that are promoting international inaudible. Some of these things are things to create increased value for our customers. 
So, we want to play the game in the most strategic way and not just on the basis of price, 
um, because that really starts to change the dynamics of competition so… Gotcha. 
Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Admire Vulvoni of Terra Partners Asset Management. 
Uh, good afternoon. Thanks for the call. Um, my question is on these SIM inaudible registration, um, using the Ghana ID. 
From your experience, possibly maybe Nigeria and other countries, 
what, uh, how many sort of, uh, subscribers do you expect to lose who don't have the proper documentation to be able to inaudible? 
And what will it impact on the top line? 
Okay. Look it's a very 
difficult question to answer concretely because of the stage we're at in the process. We're right at the beginning of the SIM registration process 
and, you know, we've already experienced a few inaudible challenges with the process itself. 
These are being ironed out. There's been some progress but there are still a few things to- to complete. Um, so all operators are effected by the inaudible challenges that are faced. 
In terms of what's realistic until the end of March, 
you know, a lot of that is, you know, based on how aggressive operators are but also how responsive customers are to the demand for them to re-register. 
We're seeing, you know, quite some good numbers reaching out to us. We've had over 
2 point something million customers already reaching out to us to re-register and are going through the process. 
We've had, you know, a 10, 15% failure rate on the registration from that base 
and so there's activity happening and this is even at a time when there are still some challenges. 
I guess to answer your question, you know, I guess, you know, it's a bit premature to suggest and to, you know, to come up with numbers that may not register. 
If we look at Nigeria for example. Um, they had, you know, multiple extensions to SIM registration 
as a result of, you know, the number of people within the populous who had the national ID. 
So, it's a slightly different situation in Ghana here where today you have over 50% of the 30 something million 
already with a national ID 
and the effort to continue to register the balance is ongoing. 
The national ID authority is expanding branches in all the regions 
so that that activity can take place. So, we're in a slightly different place from what- what happened in Nigeria. I don't think we can directly compare, um, the two situations. 
And the Nigeria base that was registered as a percent of the population when the same registration started was extremely low, uh, compared to the 50% we have in Ghana today. 
So, different dynamics but nonetheless I do acknowledge the risk of losing subscribers at the end of the period 
and I can assure you that we will do everything and throw everything at this to make sure we minimize the gap between the registered base and the non registered base to the extent that we can. 
And we're taking this process very seriously and we've already come up with plans on how to get closer to customers 
so they don't have to… The effort for customers to re-register is lower and because we're reaching out to them and setting up these temporary registration desks 
that we're moving around the country. So, there are a lot of things we're trying to put in place to make this, um, as successful as it can be. Thank you. 
Thank you. M- my… Thank you so much. My second question is that… 
I might be wrong but I think last year you were inaudible able to grow, uh, voice revenues in double digits 
and you suddenly dropped to over 2%. 
Is that pointing… What would have happened and does this point to a position where voice revenues would start to decline? 
Right. No, last year we grew voice in single digits 
and, um… I mean we obviously had quarters where we had double digits, first two quarters of the year 
and then we saw a change in trend from Q3 to Q4 in single digits. 
But nonetheless, we've seen pressure on voice and the number of drivers on the voice trend. 
I mean the first one is, we're seeing a lot more people shift to behavior from being voice-centric towards data-centric services. 
Um, so that's the natural evolution as people get smartphones and start to do more data services. 
But the second element is some of the initiatives that have been implemented as a result of the significant market power declaration. 
And the first one, the asymmetric at the end of last year. 
And in August 1st, the SMP on and off net, you know, inaudible and application that went live on August 1st. 
All of these have had some pressure on voice 
but I think the fundamental driver, um, in terms of significance is really the consumer change, um, and the acceleration of smartphone penetration within the network. 
And currently, we're sitting somewhere between 45 and 50% 
and we've seen this trend reflected in other markets where the penetration gets to these levels where 
the voice utility starts to go down very fast in favor of data. 
Okay. So, gi- given that trend, what sort of inaudible are you focusing? 
Because traditionally data and mobile money are lower margin business lines compared to voice. 
No, data is slightly lower than voice in terms of margin, if- if you had to separate the effects out but we really don't- don't separate it out. 
Mo Money is actually a high margin, a high margin product 
so, um, we continue to commit to expanded inaudible margins. I believe we committed to that at the beginning of the year 
and that's when inaudible listed in place and we believe we'll deliver on that for the end of the year. Okay. Thank you. I think I'll join the queue if I have more questions. Thank you. Thank you. 
The next question comes from Farouk Meyer of All Africa Partners. 
Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the call. Um, I have three questions. 
Um, first question is just focused on the dynamics between your, um, Momo subscriber numbers, the data subscribers and voice. 
And to receive the penetration, the percentage of voice subscribers who also happen to have 
data and Momos, you know, increased over the last few years but now it's starting to stall somewhat. 
I just wanted to check, from your side, is that something that you're tracking? Is that a key inaudible, the penetration of data, um, compared to voice, 
um, at the moment it's 47% for example data over voice. 
Is that a kind of very strong, uh, 
limit and then the focus will turn to squeezing more money of the existing, uh, subscriber base rather than continuing to grow it? 
Uh, that's question one. I'll let you answer it before the other two questions. 
Okay. It's probably worth us taking your numbers offline because we don't have those numbers that you just quoted and I'm not too sure where you're getting those numbers from. But yes, we do look at 
subscriber penetration across different products. Yes, that's something we look at and- and look at how we balance our portfolio but it's not something we have disclosed, 
so I'm not too sure how you're arriving at that conclusion. But I think it's fair to say that there are subscribers that continue to use voice, 
a portion of them are starting to use more data, and that's the trend we're seeing. 
Um, there are still, you know, if you look at our voice contribution, or our voice share of total revenue, 
it's still in the 30% range, which is still very significant. 
So, voice is not, um, any less significant than it was before and but obviously the year on year growth on voice is where we're seeing the decline so that leads to slowdown. 
So, just to clarify on my numbers. If you have 11.9 million data subscribers and you have 0.5 million voice subscribers, which is one inaudible. Um, that 
was what I meant. 
Um, crosstalk just a inaudible in terms of the consumer, uh, journey, do you normally find that the voice subscriber 
firstly becomes a data subscriber and then 
a Mobile Money subscriber, or it could be in any direction? One could have no data but still 
be 
doing Momo in some way. Yeah, it could really be in any direction. You know once you… To do data, you need a smartphone for the most part. You know, we do have data users who do GPRS but to a lesser extent. 
But to do data in our active numbers, using more than 5 megabytes a second, you're 99% inaudible to have a smartphone. But you don't need that to be Mo Money customer. 
To second thing to note here is our data inaudible definition of data, active data subscribers at 11.9 that you quoted, 
is based on a 30-day activity usage and is the same for Mobile Money. 
But for our total subscriber base, it's based on a 90-day activity so we're comparing slightly different bases when it comes to the 11.9 and 25.2. 
Okay. Um, second question is… Okay, um the second question is obviously there are a number of subscribers for data and mobile money has been relatively slow compared to your previous 
higher growth, but the revenues are still very strong. 
So which obviously points towards very higher, kind of higher usage from the existing users. 
How long 
can inaudible would you need to play out IE the existing users are being screened for basically more service versus a need to continue growing the subscriber base for data and mobile money without which you'll see data and revenue, uh data and mobile money revenue starting to slow down. 
How much more, you know, room do you have just to squeeze the existing um users? 
Okay. Let me, let me put it this way. I mean, if I look at our growth levels for mobile money, 
um today, you know, I use, you know, the numbers of our total stops. We have about 10.6 million customers. 
So there's still, you know, significant room to grow customers in terms of new customers that come on board, right. Almost doubling that amount in the next, in the coming years. 
But the second dimension is the transactional behavior of these customers and that's what you're talking about in terms of existing customers. 
Today, I mean, we're doing, you know, something like 6.7 average P2P's per user per month. 
And if I take total transactions it's somewhere in the early teens per user per month. 
And, therefore, there's from a transactional behavior standpoint that same number is, you know, upwards of 30 when you look at other markets like Kenya. 
So, existing users have a lot of room to grow in terms of transactional activity but that wouldn't happen until there is a lot more ecosystem maturity. 
We've connected a lot more merchants, I think we have about 200 000. We need to get that number to over a million, two million. 
We need to connect more services in totality. 
So there are a number of ecosystem opportunities 
that would allow the existing usage frequency to continue to increase significantly beyond where it is today. So 
I don't, I don't think we're anywhere to close to capping that opportunity 
but that doesn't take away the recognition that we need to accelerate our active user growth. 
And that's something we recognize and this is where we have the plans in place and coming out of Q3 into Q4 to find some permanents to drive in acquisition growth on the mobile money side. 
Okay that's very clear and just a last question on CAPEX. I saw in the third quarter, I think there's a bit of a pickup in CAPEX versus the first half. 
Um could you maybe re-highlight guidance for the year and and the medium term guidance in terms of where you are in the CAPEX cycle? Thank you very much. Okay, yeah. 
So typically we deploy a significant portion of our CAPEX by the end of Q3 
and this year has been a little bit more unique where we have, you know, about 20% of our deployments still happening in Q4. 
Um our total CAPEX would be somewhere around $210 million. 
And we are in terms of commitments, we are pretty much there at 99 point something percent commitments on that value. 
So we're currently just implementing the balance of CAPEX and we should see the rest of the expansions through the last quarter through this quarter. 
I think the final date of implementation is around third week to fourth week in November. 
Uh any guidance for the coming year on CAPEX or coming few years? 
Yeah, so I think our CAPEX, absolute CAPEX number would be just about the same even 5% higher 
to 6% higher, but it's in that same range of 210. I believe we'll be somewhere in the 220 to 230 million range. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Ali Al Nassar from Vergent Asset Management. Hi Salom. 
It's a, it's um Ali's colleague. I'm calling through Ali's line. Um, 
I have a couple of questions. The first one is, can you just help me understand the calculation behind average transaction per user per month um on momo? So 
I think that in you said it was between five and seven the um, you know, if we just take the total transaction 
number and divide it by the active user base, it's a very different number. 
So, can you give us some clarity on on that calculation? 
Sure. On previous calls, the five to seven has been specifically average P2P per user per month. 
So that number is about 6.7 today. So we continue to see growth, but it's about 6.7. 
Everything else would be the total number of transactions on a unique user basis per user per month. 
So it would be difficult to use the total stops to do that calculation, I'm afraid. 
You would have to have specific scripts to tease our unique customers and unique transactions to do the, to do the division. That's why I don't probably re consent to the numbers we have. 
Okay. So so internally it's that, that P2P number that you guys are most focused on? 
That's the one I've been quoting, so the five to seven is on P2P, average P2P per user per month. 
And my other question as well, sorry, it's again a kind of a number question. 
We see a pretty big difference between the TPV of momo. 
Um the market share that you guys on a TPV basis and the market share that's implied by total active users 
across all mobile money wallets in Ghana. 
Um and when we're getting that load of information from the communications authority data. Um 
I think they said there's about 18 million active mobile money wallets, 
um whereas the market share you guys have on a TPV basis, you know, is kind of mid 90 
percent ish. So do you have any idea why there's that massive discrepancy because obviously it implies that there are lots of kind of active wallets out there that aren't really being used much. 
Do you have any insight? Yeah no, 
I think the, well. 
I believe the metric you've seen from the communications authority is registered wallets, not active wallets. 
So just double check that, because um historically when, you know, when a wallet is registered it goes into a database and represent those numbers to the regulator 
and but it doesn't mean there's any activity. 
There are also legacy registered wallets 
um that were never used inaudible in the systems. It's a cumulative number. There's been no cleanup of that. So that number doesn't actually represent the degree of activity 
which is why you're seeing these discrepancies. 
The second thing is also, um some of the numbers are quoted in a 90-day basis versus a 30-day activity but I think this really more the registered users versus the active users. 
Okay, interesting um because they say that there's 44 million registered users and 18 million active No, okay. So 
I was just trying to tease out whether, you know, that come alongside the um the zero rating 
at one of your competitors, 
you know, whether you're kind of seeing anything there. Anything on the ground, but it doesn't like you are. 
Let me just um invite um Elliot to comment on that. He may have more insight on that, specifically. 
Um, thank you uh Salom. 
Um the first thing is, like Salom said, the data on the Bank of Ghana site or industry level is handled on a 90-day basis, 
whereas we report on a 30-day basis. So, there's that difference in data. 
The second one is, it may the latest uh data, but I don't have that. 
The third one is, indeed the activity on our side um is higher because of the portfolio of services that we do have on our platform for customers in terms of activity. 
So that also represents a higher activity on this side versus what you find on the platforms for the other providers. 
So those three um um specific um reasons could also feed into what inaudible have but 
we'll find yet the latest data um and also provide that as part of our next update, thank you. 
Yeah, it's amazing. That would be great. And then if I could just squeeze in one really quick one as well, please Salom. 
Can you just remind us what you guys are doing in terms of lending products? 
Are you getting much traction there, uh anything can you kind of talk about that? Sure, 
I'll have Elliot share thoughts on the lending products as well. Elliot please go ahead. 
Okay, uh thank you uh Salom. Uh in terms of the lending products, yes we have seen um good uh traction. 
Um but what we've also done is we've tried to improve on the scoring um capability so that we can also manage the level of uh people who default in the uh loan repayment and improve upon the um level of um recoveries that we have on that side. 
But otherwise we've seen um three partners already. 
Today we work with uh inaudible or ENB. We work with EcoBank 
and we work with um Absa in terms of the partners who um support the loan portfolio. 
I don't know if that addresses your question? 
Uh yeah anything you can say about the size of that product? Or is that still kind of confidential? 
The size? Today I don't have the 
specifics on the daily uh loan um that we give out, but that number keeps improving. 
Uh we shall once again provide that on the next call, thank you. 
Okay, great. That's all from me, thanks guys. 
Thank you. The final question comes Brad Virbitsky of Equinox Partners. 
Hi, um just two quick questions from me. 
Um, first is uh what's driving the growth in other, in your other expenses line? 
Um, and then the second question is, I'm curious whether your market share is different um between P2P mobile money transactions and um, I guess, P2C or B2C or these value added 
services? Yeah let me address the second question and I'll have Colby answer the question on the expenses on their other line, the inaudible line, other expenses line. 
Um so today we don't have market information on 
P, you know, to be able to give market share by product, you know, as you described it 
so it's very difficult to know what the market share by P2P, B2C, P2B 
is at the moment. 
Um so what we'll have is typically what the transfected value share is which gives a strong indication 
of what's being transacted on the platform um an indication of the share across the products. So that's maybe a proxy for P2P 
activity but it's absolutely not certain. 
Colby, you want to take that question on the expenses line? Um okay 
I think we've lost Colby. Maybe um we can take that um question um offline um. If you can just reach out to me after the call? I'll be grateful. Thank you very much. All right, thank you guys. Apologies. Thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen that was the final question. I'll now hand over back for closing comments. 
Okay um, thank you everyone and apologies for the um eight um minutes extension. Um but thank you for making time for today's call. Um 
I know there are unanswered questions so just please reach out to me after the call and I'll be glad to assist. 
Thank you and you may now disconnect from the call. 
Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.
